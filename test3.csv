tbquzZQirEpBiqxaZpjg6Q,OzGlDEQ_vzH8QU9NBRs-pw,JALVUxCfmv33jPhO7fLNHQ,2011-12-30,"For me, this place had its pros and cons.

I've been here at least twice now, once for a business conference, and more recently for an overnight stay.

The buffet food for the conference - for both breakfast and for lunch, were great.  Lots of choices, good tasting, and there was easily enough for all. 

Nice setting, easy to get to by local transit (get off at Old Mill station, and then walk brief minutes to the Inn).  There's free parking for those who drive.

~~~

More recently, I was there for an overnight stay - thanks to a romantic package deal offered by Jaunt.ca.  T'was the season to splurge, and I had impressions of how awesome this offer would be.  I expected the deal to be worth at least the value it boasted.

* room and setting:
In some ways it was its cha-ching.  The room itself was spacious.  The setting came with charm.  It was very comfortable being in the space, and we were transported from our everyday Toronto grind - which forms part of the Old Mill's success.

It's an inn that aims to ""Wow"" their guests, or so the letter from the Manager claims (found at the front of the Information binder).  Human resources will need to hone in on hiring exclusively Service-oriented employees, to get that Wow reputation.

Service from Front-desk reception, namely Shawn, has been consistently excellent.  He listened sincerely to what I said or requested, so there were never any moments of confusion to be had.  Even his phone manners have been steadily useful and efficient.

* amenities:
were okay.  They replaced the inclusion of shower gel for this hand and body foam soap.  As an occasional spa-goer, I personally opted to forgo washing anything but my fingertips with this ultra-foamy soap.  I can't imagine putting something so chemical onto my face or other delicate areas.

* Romantic details, and Package:
Loved walking in to a room that was just set up, comfortably warm in temperature, with soft FM jazz music, dimly-lit candles.  A bottle of 2010 ""Reserve du Vieux Moulin"" white Chardonnay wine, chocolate ""pearls"", and a small bottle of bubble bath was included.


""Valid for a Luxury King Room with Fireplace and 
  Jacuzzi tub for two, Romantic Package including 
  candles, bubble bath, wine and chocolates upon 
  arrival, 50% discount voucher for Toronto Adventures 
  valid for snow shoeing or cross country skiing at 
  Humber Trail, late checkout at 2pm (based on 
  availability), complimentary premium breakfast for 
  two, complimentary parking.""

The fireplace was electric.  Hit a light panel... and it switched off.  Still, nice to have in the room.  The tub was fun, but when I read Romantic Package, and worse - when I went to their website to click on some products in their Store, I associated the two and assumed that we'd get something more substantial than a small bottle of bubble bath.  As for the chocolates, being a chocoholic, my mouth mentally watered at something that our teeth could SINK into.  I was disappointed that the chocolates turned out to be... small tiny chocolate ""pearls"".  If anything, these tiny pearls stuck or sunk into the crevices of our teeth.  There was nothing, imo, sexy or sensual, or even romantic about these tiny chocolates.  I would suggest even 3 truffles instead of these pearls.  Something worth sinking our teeth and appetites into.

* Entrance:
We arrived past 5 pm, which limited our visibility into the building.  We parked in the lot, and then meandered in the dark to the nearest entrance - which ended up belonging to the Restaurant's.  This lead to a long and twisty path to finally reach the Front Desk.  Manager: More signage, please!  (see also Heather B's version - from Nov. 15\/11, where she also comments on this place being like a ""bloody maze"").  The exit, in daylight, was 100% more straightforward.

* Showerhead:
Lovely showerhead.  Good pressure.  I always notice good water pressure, and expect it at reputable inns\/hotels.

*Breakfast:
See above description of the Package details.  ""Premium"" breakfast was disappointing - we were expecting something more elaborate with warm eggs\/open coffee\/bacon\/sausages.  Basically, what we've become used to after frequenting upscale downtown hotels.  Instead, we ate in the Terrace, and had a ""modest"" selection of small bowls to pour cereal into, small cups to pour juice into, an assortment of soft-crusted breads or croissants.

*Sleep Quality:
Their King sized ""King Coil"" mattress was definitely comfortable.  Rough quote was for a reasonable $1000\/King-sized mattress.  
Their curtains also effectively blocked out any morning daylight.
(side note to fellow occasional insomniacs: some rooms come with lamps only beside our beds.  I woke up around 5 or 5:30 am.  Couldn't sleep, but didn't want to disturb anyone, or hang out in the bathroom).

I'd go again someday, for a different package, though.  Maybe this one:

I have multiple, complex and annoying health problems, which makes me a slave to the rule-reciting minions at the pharmacy counter, who don't know shit about shit. Don't worry, I understand there are rules and strict guidelines that have to be followed. Afterall, it's the idiots who abuse many medicines which have made it exceedingly difficult for the rest of us sickleys to get our DAMN PILLS.

The problem I have with them is the problem people have with the DMV and many other American chain institutions. I don't like when people treat you as a policy, instead of a person. You'll ask them a basic question and they respond with a script that someone else wrote, something memorized for the job. And sometimes, that's what you have to do. But sometimes, it's good to look people in the eye, listen to what they are saying, and, I dont know, possibly...help them?

Walgreens is genius because they hired a great advertising agency which created a bunch of commercials noting that we don't live in a perfect world, so for everything else, there's Walgreens. I threw my shoe at the TV last time I saw that commercial. We don't live in a perfect world, true, and Walgreens is a first rate offender.

There's a couple things Walgreens is wonderful for. Like shampoo. And all the shit people try to sell on infomercials that didn't do well, because, well, they're shit. There is an entire aisle dedicated to ""As Seen On TV Products"", and that's cool and everything, if you have twenty bucks you'd like to lose and are in desperate need of ""pajama jeans."" They also have a great post seasonal aisle, which has a bunch of cheap chocolate and ugly decorations that are half the price, and could save you some dough for next year. But the buck stops there. Most people need Walgreens because they are suffering, and unfortunately, it's the DMV of medication distribution.

Sadly I don't see Walgreens going out of business any time soon. For one thing, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. I'm currently in New York City, and I passed 6 in a 2 block radius yesterday. That could be an exaggeration, but they're like starbucks, only the people handling your coffee are usually 10 times more intelligent than the people handling your pills. Does this strike anyone else as a problem? I feel like I'm on CRAZY PILLS!! Then again if I were, it's not like I could get the refill when needed, in which case I'd be having a psychotic break right now. Sometimes I think that's what's going on with Charlie Sheen. I know everyone is sort of having a boner for him right now, which is cool and everything, because the guy is pretty funny and such a spectacle to watch. But I can't help but wonder if he's just been waiting for his schizophrenia medication to be re-filled this whole time, and Walgreens is to blame. (In that case, thanks Walgreens! love, everyone)

Anyway, I know deep in my soul, this blog isn't gong to do much. All I am is a sick kid with a computer. I lack the strength, manpower, and money to go after Walgreen's. You'd know who'd be great to get on my side? Charlie Sheen. I think some tigers blood could really help this issue. Then when the person behind the pharmacy counter tells me they can't fill my prescription because, I dunno, it's Wednesday and it's raining, or something equally irrelevant, Charlie Sheen could just punch them in the face. We'd high five and walk out. WINNING! The problem is there is such little accountability for institutions like this, and such little oversight.  I could complain to the manager, which I have before, but then I'm just that girl that complains to the manager, and everyone flips off when I walk out the door. I know how it works. They probably aren't paid enough, they probably aren't trained enough, and most importantly, they are not taught to treat people like people, they're taught to read rules, and that's where our system fails. We've lost our humanity.

The worst part is, I'm totally at their mercy. I need my pills. And every time I need a refill, I take a deep breath and begin the process. Tears, screams, and six thrown boxes later, I usually get it. But by that time the damage is done. I've probably eliminated years from my already sickly life. Being at the mercy of someone unintelligent and more importantly, non compassionate about your situation, is a very, scary thing. It's terrible. Walgreens is like the douchey cop that threatens to bring you to jail for failure to use a blinker, and you have to turn on the charm, hard. I don't know how to fix this problem. I don't even know if it's possible to fix it. I googled ""Walgreens Sucks"" and saw a lot of things flying around on the inter-web. I'm know I'm not alone, but I just don't know if they'll ever HAVE to change their ways.",Beauty

Today was an unlucky day for me. I called last minute and she was fully booked so I asked for Jina since I heard really good things about her from this site. 
I don't know if it's Jina's friends that posted here for her or if I caught her on a bad day but the reviews about her couldn't be further from the truth from my experience. 

- I looked around and everyone had a juicebox but me. She didn't care to offer one so I asked for it. Not a big deal but normally, it's offered right away and it's one of the cute little touches that I love about this place. I felt right off the bat like she couldn't be bothered with me. 

- She tugged at my knots without trying to hold my hair in place from closer to the root area. So I got to feel the full glory of hair pulling for a while and it really hurt!

- I asked for 1 inch off. She asked if she could do 2 and I said okay but nothing more. Someone please tell me how I walked out with easily 4 inches gone. I'm not exaggerating. My hair touched my tailbone when I went in and now it doesn't even come over my top rib area. 

- I told her right away that I do NOT want thinning shears on my hair. I know I have a lot of hair and it's very thick but unless a professional is constantly gonna be styling my hair for me, my hair gets a bit fuzzy whenever I get it thinned out. She tried to change my mind about 50 times because she said it'll help with blending and I was smiling, listening and trying to reason with her explaining that I really don't like the way my hair is with thinning shears. Finally, she purses her lips and tells me 'sure, it's your hair' and her whole attitude from then got sour. I wanted to ask her if I maybe did something to piss her off this much, seriously! I felt so uncomfortable sitting there at this point.

- Masumi told me several times how much healthier my hair had become since I got it bleached a while ago and we've been slowly cutting it out while keeping my hair long. Frequent cuts and small trims was our mantra. All my friends even told me my hair looks really healthy now and I barely had any split ends albeit I'll admit it can be a little dry.  Jina didn't care for this at all. She didn't hold back when she volunteered her 2 cents after the whole thinning shears incident. She told me how dry and damaged she thought my hair was and how we should cut off more than half of it (pretty much a bob). Not only was this slightly offensive considering I've been taking really good care of my hair since it's been dyed YEARS ago but I felt like she just didn't care to do anything that the customer was asking her to do. 

- My hair came out pouffier than when I do my hair myself! Normally when I do my hair and straighten it, it's not salon quality but it doesn't look like a furball. I understand that her hair straightener was having issues but why couldn't she have just borrowed someone elses?

- At the very end, she could very well tell that I wasn't happy. I didn't say anything but my face isn't that good at hiding my expression. I don't know why she thought it would be smart to try bringing up the thinning shears again but this time, I had a very stern ""no"" in my tone and she finally let it be. 

I didn't even want to leave a tip but my parents raised me better than that so I gave her a quick $5 and I was on my way. 

BTW, i'm not just saying this.. When my boyfriend saw me, even he asked wtf happened to my hair.

I learned my lesson. Stick with Masumi. Sorry to leave some awkward tension in the workplace for them but Masumi's the only person I've ever been happy with when it comes to my hair and Jina's the one stylist that made me this upset.",Beauty
rGsxDR4iNEOuv0uioH04kQ,f3ptgbODfNoKMDnSxOCj8A,5qc1Xv36E36DF6zCBG51Cw,2015-02-24,"I am NOT a bad review writer & rarely complain directly about or to an establishment.....unless I feel truly wronged and\/or mistreated. I understand things happen, I understand people have bad days, I understand working with the general public can be trying at times & I understand you can't make everyone happy no matter what you do to rectify situations. However, what I DO NOT understand is a business (who I believe is IN the business of making money & pleasing customers, unless I'm missing the point of owning a business) that is rude, entitled & arrogant, & who seems to not care about making a customer unhappy due to their errors. In enters Globe Salon & its owner\/salon director Staci. 
I have gone to Staci for a bit over a year. She first did highlights on my blonde hair, which I loved & was amazing. She turned me into a brunette, which I loved & was truly pleased with! So, when I decided to return to a blonde, I of course returned to Staci to do the job. Let me start by saying i am very detailed & go in prepared with pictures of what I want & discuss it in great length before anything occurs thoroughly.  I always make sure to go over things again to be sure. 
So when I go in for my appointment Saturday the 21st at 10:55 am, I went prepared with pictures of what I wanted. Staci discussed it with me & she said she knew what I wanted. As I sat there & she finished foils & applied an all over color, I began to panic a bit inside b\/c the color looked dark. I asked her about it & she said ""no it's no brown"". Got washed & my hair was dark!!  Ashy and grey. Dull and dark. her response?? We had to start somewhere!  I've been a blonde my entire life except  the last year I was brunette & know a bit about how it works!  I barely saw any blonde highlights through it & Regardless, it was NOT what I asked for. I understand taking a brunette to a blonde is not an easy task, but at no point did Staci say I wasn't going to leave with a result close to what I asked for. At that point, I told her it was too dark & was trying NOT to freak out b\/c I still had faith in her. So....she highlighted again. Re-foiled & put in more bleach. I stayed under the dryer for quite some time & got washed. Staci dried my hair & it was still dark, uneven color & ashy. Again, this result after my second attempt was NOT anything close to what I asked for. I went to pay & leave & literally began to cry. I really disliked my hair & after being there for 5 hours I was starving, emotionally irritated, frustrated & very nervous about the state of my hair after being bleached twice back to back. Staci said she wanted me to be happy & would ""throw in some more foils"". She sat me back down & I showed her a picture of what I wanted to which her response was ""well if that's what you wanted you should never have shown me the other pictures, just this one, because they are all different colors"". Ummmmmm.....am I the professional or are you?!?! Last I checked Staci was the professional & to me, someone who DOES NOT OWN THEIR OWN SALON AND DECIDED TO MAKE THIS MY CAREER, the pictures I showed her looked pretty much like the same blonde colors I was wanting. And if Staci hadn't thought so, the time to discuss that with me & go over any misunderstandings would have been at the beginning of our session, NOT when she felt she needed to defend herself & place blame on someone, clearly me, the client! So......she put in more foils. The result???? Orange streaks in the front of my hair & roots roughly 3\/4 of an inch long that looks like I've had a month or two of regrowth. On my way out I caught a glimpse and said to Staci that it ""looks orangey"". To which she responded ""I think it's just the lighting in here"". Its not the lighting! It's ORANGE!!!!!!  Ashy & grey in back, underneath sooooo much darker the the rest of my head. 3\/4 of an inch at least of roots all the way around my face & a terrible straight line on the right side of my head. I'm horrified! Called Tuesday morning &  Staci returned my call. She asked for my CC# & said she wanted to just give my money back b\/c she ""couldn't  make me happy"". Mind you, she was short, arrogant & COMPLETELY unapologetic. She did not apologize, ask what she could do to help the situation or say she was sorry once for even it not working out. While I appreciate the money back, I now have damaged hair (3 bleachings back to back!) & not even a sorry for the situation! Perhaps I missed some fashion trend where orange is the new blonde & Staci thought she'd school me, just go ahead & do what SHE wanted, not what i wanted?? Did i miss something?!?!?! I've never been so unhappy with a business or so disappointed in the behavior of a business owner!",Beauty
zZcAj_D79ziUFj3qcswYoA,L02VCesOenbuaBOcZQc2tQ,Nx-xvCj4mxFJgd48kTjgwQ,2016-02-27,"All of the nasty reviews are from people who do not understand that this is a chain retailer, which means under staffed to save a dime. The girls who work there do their very best to give their undivided attention, but they are required corporately to do more than one bridal appointment at a time. This is a reason for why the dresses are so budget friendly.
Having all of my bridesmaids in other states, and no mother or mother-in-law, dress shopping is kind of awkward. I don't really have people to go with, that I value opinions highly from. I also don't really feel comfortable with the societal norms of bride-zilla or ""having your day"" thing. I dreaded the thought of dress shopping, and wanted to get the crappy stuff of figuring out bra size and dress styles done and over with. So that way when my sister-in-law visits for Easter, I can at least take her, and show her some stuff I do like.
I HIGHLY RECCOMEND GOING IN ON A MONDAY NIGHT after work!!!!
The place was nearly empty, and it was nice and quiet. One of the associates was doing something on the computer and she chatted with me about my earthy venue and offbeat wedding I was planning. I made a backhanded comment about how my body type is a challenge to shop for- and the girl quickly snapped at me and said no! You have a wonderful body type, and the standards for beauty are off... Not everyone looks like a catalog model! This was wonderful to hear, and the girl who said it was very tall and uniquely shaped. 
I was immediately greeted and they asked how they could help me- nothing about budget or wedding date, (something a rude boutique owner will declare is MANDATORY for decent service!).
They told me I could ""book at an appointment"" for the next block which was 15 minutes away, and I was allowed to browse everything at will. They even offered me a catalog to start getting ideas. I sat at the register and bookmarked stuff I liked while I waited and that was nice.
The one thing I didn't like was the girl who did my appointment had to do two other appointments at the same time, while an associate and clearly a manager did stocking duties. I really wish the manager might have held off on the stocking duties to maybe help out her employee who was handling three sales (rather impressively), and essentially out of breath.
Rebecca H was the associate helping me and she was a delight. She wasn't fake, or trying to upsell me. I told her what I liked, and she brought me a few trial items to test the water. She brought me three I was unsure on, and I solidified that I disliked it, which was helpful. 
I had a moment where I got very upset because I needed to try size 16 and 18 gowns to fit my bust, and I felt very insecure and bummed. She very easily chirped up that gowns are made smaller, and that everyone has a unique shape, and Davids Bridal prides itself in having gowns that are friendly to any size or budget. She told me it's ok and that I'd walk out smiling even if I didn't buy anything.
This seriously made me love her.

She then brought me dresses that looked like what I ""wanted."" Then she asked me if she could try one other thing...
It was a strapless gown- and I had been clear that I didn't want straps.
She lamented that she wished they had the Melissa Sweet line, because as she put it, that was exactly what I wanted. So she asked if she could ""try something.""
So I said yes.
The strapless gown had a structured sweetheart neckline with an empire waist that had a Grecian flow to it, and was extremely flattering to my heavy bust (size 18) bust, and size 12 waist. 
I put it on, and she asked what I liked about it. I told her I loved the empire waist for my figure, and the flowing skirt was comfortable for my earthy venue. 
She then found a pretty lace wrap that is convertible, and she put it on so it created the sleeve effect I was looking for.She then added a sash with flowers I WOULD HAVE NEVER CHOSEN, and tied it just under the bust.
She had created a gorgeous dress that I would have never tried myself, that I really liked a lot.
I'd say 7 out of the 9 dresses I tried were clearance items, so she really had my best interest in mind.
She knew I wasn't buying that day, so she put the items I liked in my ""profile"" so when I go back, I can try the same stuff on again.
Needless to say, the ladies at Davids Bridal are very nice, and happy to help you when they have the staffing to do so!!!!",Shopping
6grGn9AwWDD0Q6LDv94LBA,Vsd7ptZg6evQZYPYQprgag,xm6OKOUnvpn58ejuY6-yQQ,2016-04-10,"Sorry to upset the ""rave review"" apple cart here, but I think it's time somebody give an honest review of this Safeway location. For starters, the employees at this Safeway are so rude\/snobby it's a joke. I've lost count of how many ""run-ins"" i've had with rude employees here. They don't smile, they don't greet you, they are unwilling to help (as in REAL help where they do it with a smile, not ""help"" where they're acting like they're ""helping"" you but in actuality they're only trying to get you out of their way because you're inconveniencing them). I won't even get into addressing the sky high prices as anyone with two eyes & a calculator can see that they overprice EVERYTHING (& rarely ever have any decent sales on the items you purchase most often). But the real fun starts once it's time to checkout. They shut down the self-checkout lanes early, so if you're like most busy people where you're trying to get in\/out QUICKLY, good luck as you'll have no choice but to go wait in a regular checkout lane (& yeah you'll be waiting for a while because they usually only have 1-2 registers open MAX [out of the TEN or so that they have in the store]). It's like seriously, you all can't hire more people to run all the registers so that the lines aren't so long??? Funny thing about self-checkout: You get there & if you have the right clerk standing at the self-checkout ""assistance"" register (or whatever the heck they call it) they'll tackle you, snatch certain items out your hand & start ""helping"" you to check out before you even have a chance to scan anything.. They act as if they're ""helping"" you as they sign into 8 million different employee screens at your self-checkout register, when in actually they're only slowing you down (which obviously defeats the entire purpose of why you got in the self-checkout lane to begin with).

A few months back I went to the store to purchase a particular brand of milk... There was a sale tag DIRECTLY BELOW where the milk was located, & there was a PLENTIFUL supply of this particular milk located directly behind the one that I grabbed (letting me know that obviously this milk was located exactly where it was supposed to be located). I was on a tight schedule & long story short they told me (at self-checkout\/after wasting 10 minutes of my time) that the sale wasn't for that brand of milk but another that was next to it (yet they put the sale tag DIRECTLY BELOW the brand that I grabbed)... Simple mistake right? Fast forward to this evening.. 

On this evening I approached the clearance rack & noticed some mason jar lids on sale... The label on the actual mason jar lid boxes stated ""50% off"", it showed the original price as ""$5.10"" but then the tags on the clearance rack (DIRECTLY BELOW the boxes) stated that they're on sale for ""$1.25"" each... I grabbed two boxes as $1.25\/ea was in my budget. I get to self-checkout, the girl at the register tackles me, snatches one of the boxes out of my hand, does her employee sign-in thing, & once all is said & done the price never changed back to the price that was on the tag DIRECTLY BELOW the boxes... Of course I inquired about this & was at the self-checkout for roughly 5-10 minutes or so (a LONG time when you only have 3 items). In the end, my time was wasted yet again as I had to go back & forth with her & another employee over the fact that the tag on the clearance rack stated that they were on sale for $1.25 each... Turns out that (ONCE AGAIN) the tag on the rack was for another item, yet they deliberately put it DIRECTLY BELOW the item that I grabbed. During her process of ""helping"" me get the price adjusted to what the sale tag on the rack stated, this employee was condescending, rude\/snippy & talked to me like I was 3 years old. This is unacceptable & I was seconds away from telling her to forget it & walking out empty-handed. It's one thing to GENUINELY ""help"" someone, but when you do it w\/ this nasty passive\/aggressive type of attitude as if i'm bothering you (as I spend MY money in YOUR store, which allows YOU to make a living), i'd rather help myself & ultimately take my business elsewhere.

Here's the thing: Aside from the price (which is huge), every tag in this store has EXTREMELY small lettering in regards to the product\/brand it represents, & anybody who is moving fast & not using a microscope to read the actual product\/brand lettering on the tag can easily overlook what product\/brand that tag actually represents: They know this, & as crazy as it sounds, i'm MORE THAN convinced that they purposely place mismatched tags below certain items in hopes that you'll be like most people where you're rushing, you have a cart\/basket full of items & won't notice that the item is (in reality) NOT on sale (when the placement of the tag caused you to believe that it was). Due to the high prices & rude employees, I only purchase 1-3 items from this store on any given week & soon it will be 0. Just growing tired of their scams\/rudeness.",Shopping
uqXJm084c98uXkqqvhJ45w,LNvGtveRK1APrQ4YXLNYHg,L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,2012-08-18,"If you're reading this review and you're NOT sitting at a table in Bac, you need to get in your car\/on your bike\/on the bus and get over there in a hurry. Seriously, go ahead, I'll wait.  

Holy crap, right?  I went here for dinner tonight with my parents and brother and we were all suitably impressed.  I don't even know where to begin.  First off, this happy hour is good.  And I mean, really, really good.  A very large selection of $5 cocktails and small plates means you can get an absolutely fantastic dinner for not a lot of money.  

I'm not ashamed to admit that I've got a pretty significant weakness for $5 cocktails.  Since I wasn't the one behind the wheel this evening, I tried several.  The first was a brand new addition to the menu that I'm blanking on the name (I told you I just had several cocktails) but it was Mekong Something.  Maple smoked bourbon, ginger beer and lime.  It was like a Moscow Mule but with delicious, delicious bourbon.  This drink just made my list of new favorites.  I followed it up with their version of a basil martini made with gin, St. Germain, muddled basil, and lemon.  It tasted like I was drinking perfume, and I mean that in the best way.  It had a really unique floral taste that was intense but addicting.  The last one I had was the Singapore Redux.  Think a Singapore Sling but with spicy chili added.  Each was totally different and incredibly tasty.  My mom and my brother each got the Lychee Mojito and loved it.  I especially liked that it had a lychee fruit floating in it.  My brother also got the Forbidden Fruit, which tasted like a mix between a Pina Colada and bubblegum.  It was a little sweet for my tastes, but I can see where people who have a taste for that would love it.  

Since I knew this was our dinner destination I went easy on the food all day so I'd have plenty of room.  Picking from the small plates (only $5 during happy hour), the four of us split an order of the bacon guacamole with fried wontons.  I also got a bowl of miso soup, and we split one of the coconut milk crepes.  I just ate more food than I have all week and I'm already drooling just thinking about these.  They were all delicious and are an absolute steal for that price.  

For dinner my mom and I each got a Banh-Mi sandwich with tempura sweet potato fries (also only $5 during happy hour, $8 if you add the sweet potato fries) while my brother got the Pho and my dad got the Vietnamese Noodle Salad.  The portions here are absolutely gigantic, which is both a blessing and a curse considering that you'll want to eat every bite.  Yeah, you can always take home leftovers, but you won't want to wait that long.  The Pho and the Noodle Salad were practically served in buckets, but unlike some places this was quantity AND quality.  

Believe it or not, after all that we soldiered through with some dessert.  You can't put Mitchell's Green Tea ice cream (custom made just for Bac) on your menu and not expect me to get it.  That's crazy talk.  I already said ""Mitchell's"" and ""green tea ice cream"" so I shouldn't need to say that it was fantastic, but just in case, it was fantastic.  My mom and my brother loved the fried ice cream they split (never seen it done quite like this) and my dad was impressed with the flan.  

I'd heard good word-of-mouth about Bac and people definitely weren't lying.  Even if you don't make it for happy hour the prices are very reasonable, especially considering how much food you get.  Our server also did a great job and was super friendly and helpful when we had questions.  I was really surprised that it wasn't busier when we left.  It was only 6:30, which is still kind of early, but from what I've heard from others it's never all that crowded.  That needs to change because I don't want to see this place going anywhere.

The ritzy cocktails, bottles of wine, fancy suits and extravagant dresses. You'll find all of these in every steakhouse and casino. These days modern day concepts and celebrity chefs are all the rage. Gordon Ramsay Steak, Jean Georges, Stk, Mastros Ocean Club, the list goes on and on. It's an experience to enter one of these places to enjoy great cuts, fancy drinks, and hopefully fond memories at astronomical but fair prices one would argue. Good cuts should cost that much right? What if one were to wander away from the neon lights, pass the quiet Vegas suburbs and into a little village called Tivoli?  

Service: Our server Ari alone was pretty much worth the five stars. Even with only an hour left in his shift he didn't slack or cut back at all. Instead of asking for drinks first which is what almost all servers do he asked about us. How our night was and wether we've visited before. ""what took you so long."" He quipped and I couldn't agree more at the end of the night. he went into a brief history of Echo & Rig, described the popular items, why they were popular, how they tasted, how they were made with every detail. He was selling the food in a way that I wanted to just order everything he mentioned. He was honest and genuine about it and it wasn't just someone reciting the specials. After some time of looking and processing the menu he came back with a full platter of Meats. New York, Ribeyes, Tomahawks, all in full wholesome glory. Ari went into full detail of the cuts described on the menu drawing out each imaginary cut on the steaks and describing the sauces used if any, cooking process, marbling, and flavor profile. Everything you needed to know. I like my steak rare and I wanted to order the New York Wagyu. Ari seemed concerned and quickly told me the reasoning as to why it wouldn't have been as good. (Due to the low cooking not being able to melt the fat and release the true flavors) He recommended another cut and refused to let me settle for medium rare. He could have just sold me a more expensive steak but instead he sold me a cheaper one just to match my preference and to allow me to truly enjoy optimal flavoring. Absolutely phenomenal. 

Food: I love the concept of Family Style being Asian an all. It's even more interesting to see the concept brought to a steakhouse. The starters were all shareable, delicious, and well portioned. And don't worry the steaks are not small, and they also come with a side of Chips and Mushroom. The best part is of course the price. Any one of these dishes would have been 15 or more on the strip but here it was 8-10 for starters. Steaks on the Strip $50 or more on a small cut. Here, $28 gets you an amazing cut with sides. Absolute steal, Good Prices and Amazing food is probably one of the many great joys in life.

Starters:

Bone Marrow Carne Asada: A giant Bone Marrow with Carne Asada as a garnish as well as four pieces of bread on the side. With recommendations from Ari we squeezed the orange slice all over the Bone Marrow and Carne. Although I don't have much experience eating Bone Marrow this one was great. The bone marrow melted in my mouth, Carne was juicy and flavorful, and the orange citrus gave it a refreshing tang. 10\/10 would recommend

Portobello Fries x Herb Aioli: They taste like giant fries, and it's not overly greasy but full of crunch and flavor. Then it tastes like perfectly cooked portebello mushroom. The Herb Aioli was also amazing. Not a big sauce person but I found myself and my girlfriend dunking everything in the Aioli. 

Mac x Cheese: Made with 7 different cheeses and very rich. It was delicious but we wish we didn't get this as it was just too much when it came out with our steaks and found ourselves barely picking at it. 

Entrees: 

The Spencer Cut: We both got this cut and we were both extremely satisfied. It's basically a giant Filet. The temperature was just right on both of ours, rare was cold in the middle and medium rare was hot but not too hot. The outside was perfectly seared with just the right amount of seasoning and not too crunchy or salty. You can tell a good steak just by cutting into it and it was like cutting butter. And like butter the steak melted in your mouth unleashing great flavors. The Garlic Chips were delicious and fun to snack on while the mushroom rockeffellers made the perfect compliment. We also got a choice of sauce, I got Bernaise and my girlfriend Lemon Chimichurri. The Bernaise was hearty and comforting while the Chimichurri a little exotic in flavor. 

Thoughts: Was close to going on the strip for a good steak but I'm glad I remembered passing by this place a couple days prior and giving a local place a chance. I've found myself doing that alot recently and I""m constantly pleased. Sometimes It's good to not be blinded by the glitz and glamour and stray off the beaten path, you never know what awaits.",Restaurant

We stayed at Aira a few weeks prior and it was simply a coincidence that when my boyfriend booked a 140 a night hotel on Hotwire.com, it happened to be Vdara. At first we weren't thrilled, there is no casino! We come to Vegas for the complete package- luxury hotels, gambling, booze and fabulous restaurants- this hotel really had none of those.

As we checked in we were both appalled at the ""resort fee"". 15 bucks a day for water and a newspaper? In a luxury hotel shouldn't that come included? Plus, we had no intention of using the pool and had to pay anyway. 

The style of the hotel really made me feel like I was in a W in San Francisco or New York. The lobby is rather small with no sundries shop or rows and rows of casino tables. There is one bar and one restaurant. As we reached our room, I was pleasantly surprised a the size. Our room in Aria was so tiny! This one had a mini kitchen, living area and huge bathroom. We also had full panoramic windows with a great view. 

As my boyfriend darted off to play poker at the Rio I first ordered a bottle of champagne and ran a bath. I was quoted 15 minutes for the bottle, it took 30. When I called to complain the lady simply stated, ""he is on his way"". No apology or nothing. I had to drain my bath and run a new one becuase it got cold. Later that night as we stumbled back into our room at 3:30am, we knew we wanted room service. We both sat and were so confused as to what was available at the time. I decided to call and it turned out we were missing 3 pages of our room service book so the lady simply rattled off a few things that were available- clam chowder, club sandwich, a pasta dish or buffalo wings. Yuck, definitely not what I wanted. We ordered the club sandwich and the pasta. The pasta was awful- it very obviously was re-heated in a microwave. I went to bed hungry and disappointed. 

After a good nights sleep I decided to order breakfast. Even after the terrible food the night before, I though ""how can you screw up eggs?"". Breakfast arrived promptly and it was delicious. I loved the little potato pancakes that came with the eggs and even a toaster was brought to toast the bread so it would be warm. 

Later that day I also got a organic pedicure in the spa. It was amazing! I was wrapped up in a blanket and served a cup of coffee as I received the treatment. I felt so relaxed and would recommend it to everyone.

As the weekend progressed we did notice something about the hotel we really liked- no tourists! Since there was no casino, shopping center or theater to draw in the crowds it remained so quiet. I really grew to appreciate this quality. 

All in all I think that these are great hotels, but don't really offer the ""Vegas"" experience. If you are a first time visitor or really looking to ""party"" I wouldn't recommend these hotels. But, if you are looking for something relaxing, romantic and quiet, then I would.",Beauty
pmzpnRLI1XEdSHSK6zWZMA,sJx5830XAk8YrHwEy2HNag,ba6bsA1ATHvCfZGS1B46dQ,2014-04-03,"I cannot say enough good things about Rain. The titular Melodi has been doing amazing things with my hair for almost 10 years now, but this is the first time she's owned her own salon. And it is beautiful. She really put her heart and soul into the place and it shows. From the warm, soothing décor to the quiet relaxed feel... it's just a fantastic place to be for the few hours it takes to do my cut and color. 

Upon arrival, there's always a smiling face at the front to greet me. I sink into the stylish, comfy sofa by the door until it's my appointment time (I have a habit of always being early to things). I remember to turn my cell phone to silent so it doesn't disturb the other clients. (How embarrassing if my phone were to ring and the Doctor Who theme song was suddenly blaring at full blast throughout the salon.) Melodi is always prompt and greets me as a friend. We chat and catch up and decide if this is going to be one of THOSE appointments where I've randomly decided to do something new and drastic... or if it's a maintenance appointment. (Most often it's the latter. I'm not that interesting.)

We chat some more as Melodi artfully applies the highlights to my hair. I'm every time amazed at the precision involved in doing this. I enjoy the quiet time to read (or sometimes play Bejeweled, I'm not gonna lie) and sip on a glass of crisp white wine while my hair processes. The processing area has beautiful leather chairs and a flat panel TV that is usually on mute. I feel like this is one of those rare quiet times in my life and I always savor it. It's such a relaxing environment and never disappoints. 

As blissful as this time is for me, though, it doesn't hold a candle to shampoo time. A little background on me and shampoo bowls: I hate them. I hate them SO much. I must be a weird height or something, but I've always been super uncomfortable whilst getting shampooed. At one salon previously I even had a designated ""booster pillow"". That helped, but it still wasn't just right. The first time I got my hair done at Rain, Melodi knew exactly how much I was going to freak out over the shampoo experience. I sit down in a strange looking brown chair and prop my feet on an ottoman that is exactly where my feet need to be. I lean back and my head lands on a soft, raised block in the middle of the sink. It cradles my neck and lets me experience a truly relaxing and comfortable shampoo for probably the first time ever. It's GLORIOUS. Now I can finally enjoy this part of the experience, because once the awkward neck and back angles are gone, having my hair shampooed just feels really nice!

Back to the chair and the chitchat. Melodi and I know each other well enough after so many years that it's always comfortable and fun. There's a low, unintrusive murmur of chatter from the other clients and stylists that itself is almost comforting. The haircut seems effortless and quick, but always looks divine when it's done. I wish I could blow dry my hair as well as she does it. I can't seem to ever recreate the glossy smoothness that I walk out of there with every time. 

When we're finished, Melodi walks me up front to pay and make my next appointment. We say our goodbyes til next time. The front desk is always a pleasure to deal with and gets me sorted out every time. I leave with a spring in my step and a bounce in my hair, feeling good about myself and about the day ahead of me. 

Should you go to Rain by Melodi? Of course you should. The level of expertise that goes into my hair cannot be measured. The relaxation I experience at Rain is unrivaled anywhere else. The service-with-a-smile attitude complements the hip, chic flavor of the salon perfectly. 

Now I just need to remember to schedule a manicure during my next appointment.",Beauty
8XKg_0HHspmYgBjfWVRcVA,2KHmjIAxTDsdCNv0LOUI_A,bGFUI0vv-YvjtNrq5RqIWg,2013-12-07,"Acadamy of Scuba is great for new or old divers. I love this place. 

I found AOS in October 2012 when I moved back to Phoenix. I remember driving by this place years ago and always wanting to stop in, but I never did. Evidently, AOS opened in this long-time scuba spot in 2012.

I first came here in October 2012 to take the Rescue Diver class. The class was great. It was taught by CG Durda, and it really was thorough. At AOS, the classes--especially the advanced classes--aren't just about accomplishing the bare minimum. They usually add tons of extra activities so that you are really learning and benefiting from the instructors' extensive experience. Most of the instructors have hundreds or thousands of dives and have dove in all sorts of conditions. 

AOS's model is ""the dive shop that dives,"" and that's really true. Everyone who works there considers scuba diving their passion. When we had our open water dives for Resuce, there were tons of people out at Lake Pleasant just diving or hanging out between dives. AOS creates a community for divers, and anyone can become a part of it. As an outsider, I was immediately made to feel welcome, and I was told all about the meet-ups out at the lake for diving. If you don't have a buddy, there is always someone you can join. 

Continuing on the social note, AOS has two monthly socials a week. I typically am pretty introverted and don't partake in such thing, but I made myself go to one--and now I go all the time. Why? Because now I have a ton of friends in the dive community, and this is a regular way to meet up, talking diving, or just hang out. There are all sorts of people in this crowd--from heart surgeons to construction workers--but the constant between everyone is friendliness and a love for diving. 

AOS also has tons of trips, and what is great about that is it isn't just a ticket clearance office, but a hub for dive trips that puts together lots of Phoenix divers. In April 2013, I've already booked a trip to Roatan, where the entire resort will be divers from Phoenix. Since I've been diving with AOS now for a few months, I know a ton of people on the trip. Plus, all the dive leaders will be staff I've gotten to know and are comfortable with.

On the learning side, I purchased their ""complete diver"" program, which is a ridiculously affordably priced package for multiple dive specialties. Since July, I've complete several additional specialties, such as dry suit, night diver, debris removal diver, fish identification, equipment specialist, underwater navigator, and DAN's DEMP course (which is a super comprehensive emergency first responder\/O2 provider\/first aid course). The instructors I've had include Dominic Diodato, John Flanders (owner), and Randall Medders, as well as a host of others who drop in to help out. All of ths instructors are incredibly patient and knowledgeable. There is no attitude of superiority here--even amongst people like John, who has had thousands of dives. I'm not naming all of their staff, but I have had experiences with most of them, and, while all have their different strengths and weaknesses, there isn't a bad one among them.

There is always people hanging around the shop, and the indoor pool is often open just to come in and practice skills. The selection of gear is good, and what they don't have at the store they can order for you. Prices are a little higher than online, but I'm ok with paying a little more to have a local store to check things out. I think they have price match, though. In talking with the owner, I know that there is a method to the way they stock their store. For example, while there aren't tons and tons of wetsuits always sitting around, that is because wet suite degrade, and they won't sell a customer a wetsuit that's been sitting on the shelf a year and lost some of its insulating abiltiies. ASK if you want something you don't see. Both Dominic at the Metro location and Tania at the Paradise Valley location are very accomodating.

I've had an opportunity also to observe open water classes and discover scuba diving. Personally, I've referred several of my own friends to AOS. They are extremely thorough, never compromise PADI standards, and, as always, add additional experiences to enhance the class. The instructors are patient and will work with any skill level, age, or fear. I know they have people specialized to help students with physical limitations, for example, and they work with a lot of kids, as well.

I've always been pretty picky about what dive shop I use, because I want to be able to trust the people helping equip and train me for what can be a hazardous environment. AOS has never let me down. And more than that, I've met a ton of people that have become my friends. I've always loved diving since I first dove 15 years ago, but I was always a once or twice a year vacation diver. AOS has allowed my to develop my passion through continuing education and being a member of an active dive community..",Shopping
iIRsAWAQhgN9KTKqKjr65Q,UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg,CufvfheLeRabp9N9TXGs2Q,2012-12-19,"Much like Martin Luther King, I have a dream. 

It's a long-standing dream that doesn't so much involve equality or peace, though those things are certainly up there a few dreams down the line, but rather my own selfish pseudo-sexual fantasy of being smack-dab in the middle of two of my three (See also: David Bowie's Goblin King) great childhood crushes that were not cartoon characters. What? Cartoons have needs too. 

To detail my dream (because I know y'all are into that kinda thing--this is the internet, after all) I'll start from the beginning... 

I'm the headline guest on the Late Show with David Letterman while Bill Murray is the supporting guest, meaning he goes out to interview first. When Bill's alotted interview time is over, he doesn't clear off stage and instead the show's producers decide to go back to the old late-night talk show format where the first guest just moves down a seat and listens while the new guest (me) comes on and sits in the seat nearest Dave. So while the interview would focus primarily on me, Bill could still (potentially) bounce some jokes from across the couch. 

Okay, so that's the basic setting for the dream, then I come out and the audience cheers and Dave stands to come over and great me as I walk up the stage stairs. Then Bill stands up from the first guest seat to give me the usual hug and professional acquaintance kiss on each cheek (which would be a total ruse since there'd most likely be a fiery sexual tension burning from both our loins), then as I turn to the audience to do the standard wave to fans and smoothing of my skirt before sitting in the hot seat, Bill pulls some typical BM shenanigans and jokingly sits back down in the first guest seat instead of moving over, leaving me no option but to do an 'Oh Bill, you silly goose' face with a bit of blushing and as the audience thinks I'll let the joke play out, Bill will politely get up and I'll take my seat, BUT instead I play into the humor and take the very unladylike seat on Mr Bill Murray's lap. Dave does his usual squeaky laugh and makes a joke about getting comfortable; I might make a joke while pretending I don't know that I'm actually sitting on Bill about the chair being a 'little stiff' (if the censors approve) then a laugh track would play, Paul Schaefer would signal for the 'a joke just happened' drum\/symbols, Bill would make a 'Hey man, I'm only human' facial expression and we'd continue on. 

I'd imagine Bill might take charge of my end of the interview, interjecting and acting as my handler of sorts and answering questions in my place as how he thinks I would answer them while I make corrections and BM would then say that what I said is what he actually meant to say and so on. 

At some point my hair (which will be big, bountiful and Bardot-esque with my full weave snapped in) gets in Bill's mouth a bit while I'm turning my head back and forth to Dave and Bill, whose lap I'm still sitting on. Dave points out the 'hairy situation' Bill's gotten himself into and Bill says something to the tune of it not being so bad and my hair being really soft and luxurious against his skin and that he bets it'd be a treat to run his hands through, as he gently nestles his fingers into my long, luscious orange locks. Naturally, this piques Dave's interest as he'd also like to have a feel of my mane, so he asks if he 'may' and I of course oblige. Then a few moments pass and the audience is eating it up while Dave and Bill are just loving touching my hair- so much so that Dave motions to stage hands that he needs two brushes STAT! Because nothing would please him more than being able to brush my hair. The brushes arrive, they both continue to chatter and soak up all the Candice G hair brushing they can, even bypassing the regularly scheduled top ten list and substituting with their own top ten of why Candice G is so wonderful with supporting reasons being things like, 'because Candice is so charming', 'because Candice hair was rated 5-stars on Yelp', 'because we love Candice'... etc, etc, they don't have to make sense, this is my dream and I can paint it however I choose. 

The show ends with Alan Kalter basically having to cut in and sign out for Dave since he, much like Bill, is still so enthralled in brushing my hair. There's also no musical guest since the sound of smooth brush strokes and careful whispers between the three of us are music enough. And of course there's more to the dream than just that but a girl's gotta keep some sh*t private, right? 

Aaaanyway... Thanks to the magic of GelaSkins, a contest held by my boss and a cornucopia of #Winning, I can have a little bit of that dream on a daily basis in the form of my custom MacBook GelaSkin with just the most beautiful image you've ever seen (see posted image)--a semi old-school pic of Bill Murray and David Letterman on the Late Show. I can close my eyes and be that much closer to being between icons. Gelaskins: making dreams come true.",Shopping

Unfortunately the salon I previously frequented, my stylist was no longer there. After years, I was lost again. Anyone knows how difficult it is to find a good stylist, and by good I mean, talented, skilled, and someone who you can comfortably spend hours with one on one while they do your hair. 

First, I called, last minute of course (I come from out of town) and was SHOCKED when I asked if there was by chance any availability today for what I needed (a 4.5hour block of time) and the receptionist said, yes, I will find someone and call you back. WOW. I was already in love. Nothing is more depressing than getting your hopes and dreams together, only to have them dashed to pieces and return home with sad hair again. A very short time later I received a call from Kristin Royseland saying she could do it, and gave me a time about an hour later. Then she did call me back shortly after that to let me know there was a slight delay, which I found considerate and actually helpful because I ate cookies next door. 

Upon my arrival, I was greeting by a friendly receptionist. Checked in, I looked in awe at the fluidity of the establishment. There were TONS of people working, tons of chairs (stylist, not just for hanging out) and yet, it seemed to work. It wasn't loud, which was shocking, and it was nice, but not so nice that I felt awkward or unwelcome..I've had those circumstances before. Shortly thereafter Kristin located me...which wasn't hard. I had warned her of the heinous hair I was sporting. 

Call me shallow, but I judge the amount of styling freedom by the way the stylist has their hair. Not necessarily that its a style or cut that I want, but that it works for them. I'm no hair guru...but ANY stretch of the imagination, so I like input, however if your hair looks awful on you, and you are doing mine....I'm probably going to hesitate on giving you the liberty to do what you think. With Kristin, it was, just do it. She gave her suggestions, which were on par with my thoughts, but one step further, and went to work. Friendly, delightful, no overly talkative, or boring. It was comfortable conversation and nothing too forced or weird. I hate that. 

We went through a series of painted on color, mixed with foils, and the time flew. Off to the processing room (sounds like Wonka huh) and then to the bowl for some additional treatments and eventually a wash, rinse, and back.

Kristin then utilized her techniques to shape my hair into something I can manage. simple, but absolutely fabulous. She then walked me through products being used, how to use them, and even techniques, since she knew I was not someone to spend 3 hours on my hair each day. I truly appreciate that. And for the finale....I was proud to leave with my hair done. I didn't feel like a hussy, like I had just left an 80's party, or was completely underdressed for the black tie even I was to appear at later. Just the right amount of everything. 

And you know what? The price was awesome too. This is hands down in my top 3 (possibly even the number 1 slot, but some of my greats were like a decade ago...so I can't accurately compare) hair jobs ever. So, thank you Kristin (if you EVER read these) You did an amazing job. Even my hubby, who NEVER EVER mentions hair unless I ask him, was very pleased, and didn't require prodding. FABULOUS. I could have hugged you, but that would have been weird....So folks, this salon is awesome. Don't hesitate to give it a whirl. and if Kristin is available, see her.",Shopping

As you can see my rating hasn't change, I was really hoping it would. But, unfortunately I cannot in good faith increase my star rating or delete my review after the irate conversation with the owner Lindsay Smith. 

As you read in my original review, after purchasing a booklet of deals I had a horrible experience. When I tried coming in for my second appointment, I was disappointed once again. Now, you could very easily ask why I would ever make a third appointment, well that's simple, my services were already paid for and after complaining three times (on the phone, via Facebook and in person) I was assured I would not have the same stylist as my first two visits. I understand that just because the salon hired one guy who can't cut hair and is extremely rude, that doesn't mean the rest of the staff is that way. So, I scheduled an appointment for Saturday, Feb 1st.  

On the Thursday prior I received a call from the owner asking me why I scheduled an appointment after leaving a one-star review (2 weeks prior). I explained that I had essentially already ""pre-paid"" for my services and that I was going into my appointment with an open mind. I was hoping I would leave with fantastic hair and would then be more than happy to rewrite my review. Lindsey didn't see it that way. She made it very clear she wanted that review removed, claiming it was ""unfair"" for her. I told her I could not just remove my review because she asked me to, that I would be happy to change it after my appointment or if she made things right and just refunded what I paid for my booklet. She explained she was canceling my appointment, that she did not want me in my salon simply because I gave her a negative review and said she would contact the third party I purchased my booklet from for a refund. 

Lindsay called me again that night to remind me I no longer had an appointment (I heard you the first time) and that she spoke with the third party and I would NOT be getting a refund. She insisted I remove my review since in her opinion it was slander, claimed she had already talked to her attorney about this. Well guess what, you can't bully someone into removing a review you don't like!!! She repeatedly blamed me for being in this situation, saying I should have contacted her. However, I informed her salon of my problem on 3 separate occasions, it is NOT my fault if your staff does not inform you there was a problem and you have a client that's extremely upset. The fault lies with your staff not informing a manager like they stated they would, it lies with your stylist whom I wouldn't let groom a homeless dog and you for having NO clue how to run a business. Based on the filtered 1-star reviews I'm not the first to be dissatisfied and unfortunately I will likely not be the last. 

To cancel my appointment simply because you do not like my review is not very professional (or mature), a real business owner would have wanted me to come back in to show me that her company is better than this. Instead, (to no surprise) she threw a fit and hung up on me when I refused to delete my review. Very unprofessional!! 

In the end, I never got my money back. She claims that the $50 I spent on the booklet was less expensive than a $65 hair cut there, which would make sense if I had actually left with a decent haircut and didn't have to go elsewhere for it to be fixed. 

Additionally, they are advertising services they do not have. The booklet included services for a manicure and a pedicure but for months I have been unable to schedule one because they cannot seem to keep a nail tech on staff...I wonder why??

One more thing, please read the previous 5 star reviews. Some are employees (they said so in their review) and others are clearly either friends of the salon or work there themselves. There are too many reviews where this is their only review. They don't have a yelp photo, didn't complete their profile, don't have any friends and this is their only review. Seems mighty suspicious to me. But, if that's how Lindsey feels she needs to portray her business, she's only hurting herself.",Beauty

I'm not sure that it will matter or that someone will even read it and care. But I feel I must as I stayed up until 3am last night doing research on Living Spaces. 

I discovered LS while googling this past weekend for new furniture. I went in the Phoenix location yesterday and spent at least 2 hours there-the place is beautiful! I've never seen anything like it, either. I was immediately greeted and told that the employees don't work on commission. That's fine, but I didn't ask so I'm not sure why I was told. Well if I was a betting woman, I'd put everything I have that they DO in fact work on commission because they won't leave you alone while you're there! OMG, it was ridiculous. Every 5 seconds someone was asking if I needed help. When I said no, they would proceed to ask me what I was shopping for, if they could show me something specific, etc. NO, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE MY GOD! There was one woman (think she was a designer-foreign accent) that was basically trying to force me to use the free design services. I am a pretty skilled designer and don't need it but she wouldn't stop talking about it every time she came up, which was at least 10 times during my experience there. There has GOT to be some other sales incentive because I was pestered more than I've ever been, even when car shopping. They need to BACK.OFF. 

So I continued to shop because most of the items are exactly how I'd want my house to look. I even took pictures of everything I liked so I could narrow it down and buy. I only came for a couch\/sectional but found a bed I liked and was going to buy it too. When I left I was so excited that I called my husband in the parking lot. 

Later that evening, I googled Living Spaces and my screen was full of nothing but complaints. Literally, I hadn't seen a single positive review unless it was by someone who I would bet money on works there. SO fabricated-technical terminology, straight out of a commercial-sounding. Terrible experiences once furniture is paid for, it's like Jekyll and Hyde. Furniture being delivered broken, damaged, deliveries not showing up at all, showing up at wrong times, taking days, weeks, in some cases months longer than stated. Repairs taking MONTHS. Items being delivered back in the exact shape they were picked up, without repairs being made. Literally being told that ""it's not our problem"" when customers contact you with issues. Lastly, the absolute refusal from LS employees to allow customers to speak to managers. 

Now I'm back at square one, trying to find a good furniture store. You'll be closing your doors faster than you opened them if these reviews keep pouring in. Such a shame...well, I doubt I'll hear back from anyone but I feel better walking away with my several thousand dollar purchase I was going to make...

UPDATE: against my better judgement, we've purchased a few items from LS. We had 2 rules-it had to be in stock and ready for purchase and WE would bring it home, not their delivery service. I actually feel sorry for this company because it's not going to survive due to their customer ""service"" call center. They refuse to let you talk to the individual stores when you call. They're like Ft Knox. There is NOTHING you can say or do to talk to the actual store you shop in. We wanted a bed but apparently it's constantly out of stock (according to the employee there). He said they never have it but continue to display it. He stated to call back on a certain day and they'd have it-we could call and pay and pick up. Well, the call center refused to let us talk to the store and said it's not possible to pay on the phone. No less than 5 phone calls and hours later, we were in the same boat. They assured us they wouldn't sell out because the store ""just got 50 of them"". Went to buy it yesterday and guess what? Sold out. Shocker. Mind you this is an hour drive one way for us. We couldn't find out over the phone as we couldn't talk to the store. Huge cluster f*ck of a store. Mind=blown.",Shopping

Dumpling King is a hidden gem in every sense. Nearly every time we've been here, their huge supposed to be lit sign out front is either off or broken, and the place nearly looks deserted besides a car or two in the parking lot. It probably doesn't help either, that if you're heading West on Spring Mountain, it's almost impossible to see with it being tucked behind a large plaza building. Plus, I don't see advertisements for them anywhere, and for whatever reason, the amount of reviews on this place is crazy low. It's like people just don't they are there...but why? It's so good!

Our first trip to Dumpling King was admittedly a little nerve-wrecking. Besides not having a clue where it was, or really having never heard about it at all, it was strange walking into a place that was pretty much empty of other diners, but full of bright floral designs...and Christmas decorations. Yup, Christmas decorations. Which as of now, July, are still up in subtle spots across the restaurant. But really, it's all part of the charm for me now. I like the decor, decorations and all, and the place is always clean.

The menu is large, and has plenty of things to choose from. Some things that I can't even read. Luckily we've been here a couple times with regulars who have pointed us in the right direction on what to order. I'm pretty sure we've barely even put a dent in the list of items, but now that we've been here a handful of times, there are some things I can confidently recommend.

For smaller items that you can start with while you're deciding on what to eat, order the String Beans. A large plate of fresh beans with dried peppers and tons of flavor, it's likely to be a hit with anyone who has working tastebuds. And of course, as the name would imply, they have excellent dumplings. We've tried a couple different types here, but we always seem to go back to the Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings. Even my 6 year old can't get enough of these things. A little vinegar and\/or chili paste just sets them off even more. How they can pack that much flavor and juice into those little things is beyond me. But, if you want to get some idea, you can watch them being hand made in a little room to the right of the kitchen. That's also where they make one of other favorites, the Vegetable Fried Noodles. Thick, handmade noodles served perfectly cooked and piled high with veggies. 

There's probably not enough room with the character limit for me to get to everything, but for larger ""main course"" type stuff, some must try dishes are the Fried Lamb w\/ Cumin, and our new found item added to the favorites list, Black Pepper Beef. Both of these dishes are packed with tons of flavor, fresh and perfectly cooked meat that's piled high for plenty of sharing.

I've also had a number of items that I likely wouldn't have ordered myself, due to sheer skepticism, but ended up really liking. One of which is the Teppan Tofu, mainly because I don't normally get tofu anywhere. But it, just like pretty much everything else on their menu is packed with flavor and comes in a huge portion. The other thing I really enjoyed, but probably wouldn't have ordered was the Baked Yoked Coated Pumpkin. Don't get me wrong, I like pumpkin, but it just doesn't have a ring to it. Flavorwise though, it doesn't disappoint. It's almost like a dessert french fry, even more so because there's no way you can eat just one.

When it comes to the food, there really hasn't been a single thing at Dumpling King that I haven't liked. And if there was any negatives to this place whatsoever, it's the hit and miss service. Usually the biggest issue is getting refills here. For whatever reason, they like to take their time with getting you water. We also had a weird little interaction on our last visit, which was our 4th time here, where the main waitress (I think owner) asked if we needed forks. I mean...c'mon, I know I'm a white boy, but you've seen me here before...I know how to use some dang chop sticks lady. Well, sort of. Good enough to eat at least. 

Overall, DK is easily one of, if not my favorite restaurant in the area. Every time we come here, the food is excellent, and large groups can split tons of food that really isn't that expensive. Like I said...hidden gem, check it out!",Restaurant
Act3Edmipn2vGNjVmz7frQ,mQKPe8TtEB0-nM8NsRawtg,u1W5eCxucRPY9cyQHdmiKw,2014-12-01,"The only reason this review gets a second star is because of the bridesmaid dress shopping. If I'd only had my bridal gown appointment, this would be one star. I am a planner, so I made two appointments at this location for the same day, an 11am for the bridesmaids and a 5pm for myself. This was about two weeks ago.

The Good:
The bridesmaids' appointment went well, with the exception of a store error that caused a short period of distress for myself and one of my bridesmaids. Our consultant for the bridesmaids' dresses was very nice and attentive. She greeted us as we walked in the door and she had my favorites from my online profile printed out. She quickly showed us where each of the favorites were located and we decided which ones the girls should try on. We decided on a dress in under an hour and my girls ordered theirs. My only issue with the bridesmaids' dress shopping experience is that one of my bridesmaids called the store today to see if her dress had came in (I had received an email that my maid of honor's dress was in) and they proceeded to tell her that they had no record of her purchase or my wedding party, despite the fact that I (and my maid of honor) witnessed her purchase the dress the day of the appointment. After the associate implied my bridesmaid was lying, she asked to speak to the manager and was able to get it straightened out. It turns out they had missed the last letter of my name when they entered her order. My name was spelled correctly on my maid of honor's order and on my DB online account, so it was just a typo, but it caused some temporary distress.

The Bad:
When we returned for my bridal gown appointment later in the day for my second time slot, we arrived about 15 minutes early, so we looked around for a bit. When it was time for my appointment, my consultant came over to me (a different one from the bridesmaids' appointment). She had an attitude from the very beginning. She asked me my pants size and I told her 8-10, but that I was smaller on top. She then says ""OK, then you'll need a 12.. all of our dress sizes are your pants size plus one."" I told her how I wear different sizes depending on what the item of clothing is, because I have a big bottom (size 10-12) and smaller waist (size 6-8). She would cut me off and say in a very rude tone (my bridesmaids were there with me and couldn't believe she was using that tone while supposedly trying to make a sale), ""It's ALWAYS your pants size plus one, so it'll be a 12."" I can't imagine how a body-conscious bride might react to her words and tone she was using in this moment. Luckily for her, I couldn't be happier with my figure. I have flat stomach with curvy hips.. but she could really hurt someones feelings. 

Then, she took me to the fitting room and when she was dressing me, she would jerk the dresses around me and was very short with me. I was really bothered by  her attitude because I couldn't be a more agreeable person. Despite all of the attitude she gave me, I still smiled and was friendly. I'm not a person who ever yells at people. I am laid back and even timid, so I would never be rude to the salesperson and couldn't understand why she was that way with me. All of the dresses she put me in were size 10 by the way, not 12, and they fit perfectly. So much for her ""your pants size plus one"" attitude. Another instance of her poor customer service was when I tried on a dress with a waist sash. She tied the sash on my waist, and I explained to her that I would rather it be around my hips where (in my opinion) this horrible looking seam was. She told me that the sash would ride up if we put it there without getting it sewn on, which I told her I understood. However, I asked if I could still see it tied at the hip to cover the seam because the only way I would buy that dress is if I got a sash sewn on to cover that seam. She tied it at my waist (inches above the seam) once again, so finally my maid of honor held it down at my hips where I wanted to see it since my consultant wouldn't. After this, I had told my family and friends that were there that this consultant was ruining my experience and making me not want to spend any money here at all. Thankfully, since I am not comfortable confronting people or being rude to people, my future sister-in-law went and spoke to the manager about her. The manager took over for some time and that was better, but we got the original consultant back again shortly after.

Overall, I was very displeased with my experience at David's Bridal. I expected more from such a large company. I would think that the sales associates work on commission, but by the carelessness I experienced, it seems as if she could care less if we spent money there. Prior to this experience, I wanted to buy not only my gown there, but also my veil, mother-of-the-bride dress, and flower girl dress there, but now DB has lost my business for all of those things. I am happy to say that I found my dress elsewhere.",Shopping

I have two deep regrets: (1) I wish I had gone to Bellair sooner! and (2) I wish I wrote this review sooner so you could go sooner :). As you can tell, I am so pleased to finally update this review. The Bellair team demonstrates a high standard of client care and consistent improvement and demonstrates commitment to customer service excellence and results. 

It's such a wonderful feeling to know that a beauty clinic really cares about ensuring their clients see positive results AND have a good experience.I received a personal apology from a member of the management team about my previous painful\/rushed experience. The apology and customer attention was a genuine gesture of concern, completely unexpected, and definitely appreciated!  

Although my treatments are not fully complete (I am on my 7th treatment), I can confidently recommend that you will not regret going to Bellair for laser hair removal. I have been seeing positive results from the laser treatments and everything has improved--service is friendly and professional, treatments are comfortable and unrushed, staff is accommodating to my unpredictable schedule changes, and the management has certainly taken an active interest in ensuring that my one unfortunate experience is not repeated nor is it reflective of their overall service. For these reasons, I recommend choosing Bellair for all your hair removal needs! My hair is so much thinner and it barely grows back in now! I am shocked at these results and will definitely keep up maintenance treatments even after my full 10 sessions are done. I also can't wait to enjoy other treatments with Bellair in 2014!


GOOD STUFF

-Flexible appointments
-Competitive price (yes a bit pricier than other places but they are worth every penny)
-Results-oriented  (trust me, I'm a brown girl and there is no better feeling than seeing your facial hair diminish month by month. It works!)
-Exceptionally clean and polished
-Wait time is never longer than 15 min. (99% of the time I only wait 5 min. How incredible is that!?)

FUN STUFF

-High fashion and decor magazines while you wait
-Ipads to play with while you wait
-Deelish water and chocolates
-Modern, comfy sofas to lounge on while you wait
 
Stay tuned for an update on my final results :) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi ladies,

Last time I wrote about my awful experience during my second laser hair removal treatment at Bellair--It was painful, rushed, and overall not as thorough or as pleasant as my first experience. Luckily this time, my treatment was much more pleasant. If my experience keeps improving, I will definitely be more inclined to purchase other treatments with Bellair and recommend their services with confidence. 

Here's what has improved since my last visit: 

The Greeting: 
A staff offered me a cold glass of water and sweets while I waited for my appointment. 

The Experience: 
-The specialist asked me about my last treatment and explained that one of the reasons why I felt more pain was that the intensity is increased each time, but when I told her how poor my overall experience was, she understood. 

The Treatment: 
-The specialist did a through makeup cleansing done before treatment. 
-The specialist carefully shaved my treatment areas and didn't ask me to do it. 
-The specialist marked off my face and asked for confirmation that I was pleased with the way it was marked off before treatment.
-She consistently asked me how I am during the treatment, especially for painful areas. And, for areas that were painful because the hair is quite coarse, she paused between the beeps, which I really appreciated. She also kindly reminded me that if I need to take a break, just to let her know. 
-After the treatment, she washed the gel off and applied SPF in such a way that I felt like I was having a mini facial....bonus! 

Here's what hasn't improved: 

Requests:

The staff failed to let me know that the specialist I requested wouldn't be in at this location. It was caught off guard because when I called back to confirm, the staff member I spoke to assured me that the specialist I requested would be in. Luckily this new specialist was good! 


Looking forward to my next treatment!",Beauty
ASUXrcPYy6C74WZhCG8NoQ,adFXxSM3JBrflUMltYIffw,1EbdmUMbrS12DougfSOqHw,2015-03-21,"This review is about the LOUSY\/ INCOMPETENT customer service I received while ordering my engagement ring on KOHLS.COM. This started on March 9, 2015. My mother agreed to order my engagement ring by request of my fiancee from Kohls.com while it was on sale so that we could get the wonderful sale price and he could just pay her for the ring. It was a 3000.00 Simply Vera Vera Wang on sale for 1050.00. What a deal, right?! Yeah, we thought so too. So my mom and I called, spoke to a rep named Jessica, who took the order, told us it was good to go and it would be in my mail between March 13-18. My fiancee and I checked the mail each day impatiently (because even after we get the ring, we have to take it into the Kohl's store so they can then send it out to be sized so that's more time that I have to WAIT for my ring). On March 16, I called into the customer service line since I never received a confirmation email or tracking number as was promised. I wait for 24mins before they answer the line and speak to Jennifer who informed my that our order was rejected. In shock, I ask why. She informs us that the idiot who placed our order put MY name on the billing address that matched my mom's card. So even though my mom's credit card company approved the charge, Kohls.com's fraud department rejected it. Furious at this point, I ask why I wasn't notified. No one knows. Great. So Jennifer gives me an additional 50.00 off the price and places my mom and I on hold while she cant figure out how to make the charge go through on my mom's credit card. Then at the 59 minute mark, the call goes into the after call survey. She disconnected. And guess what? No call back. Perfect. I call again, speak to Kipp. He fills out all the info, takes 100.00 off for the inconvenience and got my mom's approval to charge the card. He says all is good to go and I say great and ask for a supervisor. I then speak with Jim. I tell him about this awful experience and he says he will pull those calls to find out what happened and do some agent coaching, he's so sorry, etc... Great. The next day, my gut tells me to call to check on this ring after all the hassle. Good thing I did, cause guess what?! It was REJECTED.. AGAIN! No one actually ever explained to us why this time either- just that it's their procedure to verify since it's a large amount of money. Ok, but then why did no one question it when we ordered it to begin with. Shouldn't they just automatically send us over to fraud so we can clear it up right away instead of having to go through this mess? And how the HELL do they know who's calling anyway?! Anyway, I get transferred to the fraud department where I am advised by Romero that he can ONLY talk to my mother and then his supervisor, John, who advised the same thing (And by the way- this is the ONLY consistency among the Kohls.com representatives). I ask him why she needs to confirm AGAIN that this is our order and he says there are no notes that she has called in to make this order. Are you kidding me?! She placed the initial order herself! Then she was on the line each and every single time we talked to these morons! I asked him to pull the call and he looks for it but their 'systems sometimes cant find the calls' so I was out of luck until I could reach my mom. She calls me back and I call into the fraud number John provided me with and spoke to the most unprofessional, rude woman named Vanetta who refused to speak with me even though my mother was on the line. She continued to call her hon and speak over her and me and then talked about me in the 3rd person as if I wasn't even on the line saying, "" I'm sorry I had to agitate your daughter and congratulations on the wedding.""  We asked her for the corporate office phone # and she said she could find a # for us. My mom asked her who the CEO of Kohl's is and she said she 'didn't know which one would answer.""  So, she placed us on hold for 17 minutes while trying to figure it out. I Google search the CEO, found a name and number to that office in about one minute's time. She FINALLY came back to us and still had no clue what she was talking about so we asked her if our order was good. She said yes the order was cleared 'forever ago.' Forever ago?! NO. Forever ago would've been on March 9th when we ORDERED IT!! We asked her how soon we.can expect an email and she said 15mins. So we hang up with her and I call back into customer service and request a supervisor. I got Jim again- the same guy I talked to the night before. HE told me it had been cleared by fraud the day before. Huh. Then why did we just spend an hour and a half on the dang line with FRAUD?! HE said he was sorry and that he had no words. He told me he would call me to let me know when it was in fulfillment. He did. I called the next day to check. Then I found out the email address was wrong. Sigh. I had to have mom call in to change it, but today we find out it cant be changed so no email will EVER be sent. So, still no ring",Beauty

As a veteran shopping to pick up a few items on Memorial day I would have hope to not experience the lack of customer service I received this morning. I would not like to not ever have rude and incompetent workers, but especially not today. I arrived at the neighborhood walmart at 0640 and wanted to make a transaction from Walmart to Walmart at the customer service counter. I was told that they did not open until 0700. No worries I could pick up a few things before the store was crazy with people right.  I proceed to pick up a few items. Now baking to the customer service counter were I stood there as I was not even acknowledge as two employees one appear to be a manager assisted another employee complete another translation for a customer.  No problem however, a third employee then walks over and stands there looking at them (middle aged Caucasian woman who's name tag I could not see) and disregarding me standing there. I'm patient so no problem I continue then another employee who's name tag read ""Blanch"" came from her register  (register 5) and say to me you can check out at register 5 I stated now for the second time that I'm trying to complete a Walmart to Walmart transfer. So now the third employee I spoke off above decides to say it's a form around the corner you need to fill it out.  I go around the corner to fill the forms and come back.  She asks what's the reference number I say excuse me she says you don't have a reference number.  I ask why would if I need a reference number.  She says oh you are not picking up money. I then say realize she had not listened to me the three times prior that I stated clearly I needed to send money I sing walmart to Walmart transfer. I now become frustrated because she has already displayed signs of apathy. Who comes to work first thing in the morning not wanting to do your job. I told her I had clearly stated multiple times this morning that I would like to send money using walmart to Walmart transfer and this is ridiculous to go through the extras as clearly she has not listened to anything that I was saying. She proceeds from behind the counter to retrieve a money gram form. I'm now thing is this real or is this a joke... then a sign from the heavens as now my patience is leaving and I feel myself about to tell this employee how incompetent she is and how she needs to seek other employment of she does not understand the concept of customer service as this is the customer service counter; Jessica!!!!! Thank God, Allah, Buddha and the rest for Jessica. I tell Jessica I have now tried with multiple employees to send this walmart to Walmart transfer. She immediate apologies and with 2 minutes averaging 60 seconds per transaction I required I was done. I can clearly see why Jessica is a manager. During this time Blanch co.es over and interrupts my transition to ask Jessica a question. I'm thinking this woman is the rudest person ever. I came in yesterday and tried to get a bag of ice she says oh there are no bags of ice. I walk over and yes it is for sure ice so then I have to get back in line to get one bag of I've because she failed to even check to see if it's ice. Needless to say I will never go to Blanch for any help. I watched her treat other customers well, but for whatever the reason in her eyes I was not worthy of the same respect. If I could give no stars for Blanch and the middle aged Caucasian employee I had the displeasure of encountering this morning I would for sure do that. As far as Jessica I would give her 5 stars for customer service. She was very efficient and respectful. I made sure to tell her how much I appreciated her because the employees before her lacked knowledge, customer service, and just common respect. I am a disabled veteran and this is the closet to my house so if I go out alone I come her, but I will be sure to comment every time I experience this kind of treatment. If I spend my money in a store at minimum I should receive a decent level of customer service and tell last two days the same employee ""Blanch"" has totally miss the mark.Thank you Jessica for your knowledge and ability to assist when your employees failed. I annoy say enough that Jessica is a 5 star manager and this store could use more employees like Jessica. 

On a side note I heard a customer say happy memorial day... there is nothing happy about today I lost many fellow soldiers in battle. Some may think it's a day to be off from work and barbecue, but actually people should take a moment to remember those who serve and have served. Some paid the ultimately sacrifice and that is the purpose of this day. 

Neighborhood walmart there could be a lot of more respect shown to your veterans customer despite their disability.  Again this is my account of what happened to me at the neighborhood walmart this morning.",Shopping

I do some Yelping and respond with...if you take me to this wine bar (and a fried chicken place) I found, I will be a happy camper on this trip. He agreed. 

He kept up his end of the bargain, we went to both places I wanted to go. I tried to be good, but i'm not perfect. Postino East, however, is.

We got there around 5:30 and there was no wait. When we left the line was out the door. This place is super cute, and huge! There is a bar, a large dining room, a large outdoor patio, and a large yard with little tables to sit at. Service was perfect the entire time. Food was served very fast. The portions are huge and the prices are very good.

Not knowing how large all the portions were, we ordered three things. Two would have been fine, but we ended up being able to take a good amount of food back to his friend's house for them to eat.

Wine and beer selection were good. You can get a freshly made mimosa or bellini for only $5. All wine is $5 a glass before 5:00 PM, after that none of the wine is more than $12, most of the wine was $9 - $10 a glass. I had one bellini, delicious. I also had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Italy that I enjoyed a lot. BF had a beer of some sort that he liked, so he ordered a second one.

Pub Board - This amazing wooden board is covered in yummy soft, salty pretzels, a spicy mustard, chorizo, an assortment of pickles, aged cheddar, and the best corn nuts I have ever had. Everything was perfect.

Bruschetta - For $14 you can choose four different kinds of bruschetta from a list of twelve. We went with Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. The portion is MASSIVE! We ended up taking half of this back to our friends. I did like that each piece of bread is sliced into four small pieces so it is easy to eat and easy to share. All of the selections we made were wonderful, with my favorite being the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. The pesto on the salmon bruschetta was amazing. No complaints about any of our choices. 

Nine Iron Panini - The Pub Board and Bruschetta were brought out before the panini, and once we saw how much food we were dealing with, we asked if the panini could be cancelled, but they had already made it. Luckily, they served it on two plates so we could share, so we ended up just sharing one half and taking the other one to our friends. This panini had chicken, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and a dijonnaise. We were given a choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread. We went with ciabatta and it was a bit too hard for our taste, focaccia would have been better. The dijionnaise was very strong and was the main thing I tasted in this panini. It was a good sandwich, but my least favorite of the three things we ordered. What I did love though, were the potato chips served on the side. They were huge, crispy, salty, tasted just like Lay's, but not at all greasy! The best chips, ever.

The bill for our four drinks and all the food was about $65. Great deal for how much we had. Postino needs to bring it's perfect little ass out to California. If not, I will happily agree to go visit his friends again...IF we get to eat here :)",Restaurant

My fiance and I came here today because we have a certain type of lubricant that leaves us both feeling sort of sticky afterward so we were looking for something different and maybe just coming to poke around a little (pun intended lol).

When we walked in we were immediately greeted, but were given ample time to browse before someone came and asked if we needed assistance. I can't tell you how nice it is for people to have proper timing in their assistance and not feeling as if I'm being assailed.

A girl came up around the 2 minute mark and asked if we were finding everything ok or if we had any questions. I let her know that we didn't at the moment but definitely would soon. 

We browsed some of the lubricants and after we had circled the section twice, another girl came up and asked if we had any questions and by this time, we did.

We showed her the one we had been using and the general idea of what we were looking for. Not only was she able to tell us why our particular brand felt sticky, she was able to give us several different options, explained why they were awesome objectively and professionally, and was able to suggest products using descriptive language, while still remaining almost completely PG. We're not very shy people, but if we were, we would have been put completely at ease by her laid back approach. Within 5 minutes of speaking to her we had chosen a lubricant and a texturized male ""egg"" sleeve, that I won't describe, but encourage you to ask about, as the idea is not for everyone, but is a brilliant and very interesting product. 


With our main purchase goal out of the way, we went to browse some more. I was walking around with the two items we had chosen and a girl came and asked very kindly if we wanted her to hold our items at the register. I said yes thank you, and when I handed them to her she smiled and said, ""Oh these are lovely choices,"" and took them to the register, without a hint of creepiness. Do you know how difficult it is to compliment someone on their choice of lube without sounding creepy? Well this girl pulled it off. It sounded like a genuine compliment, and I took it as one. :)


With our main choices made, and our hands free, we were ready to rock. The store itself has polished concrete floors, and a very modern spacious layout. Think Victoria's Secret, meets Bath & Body Works, meets high end sex toy shop, sort of layout. Starting from the far left of the store going to the far right the products are undergarments (women's and men's underwear, bras, garters, thongs, stockings) sleepwear (silk and lace nightgowns, teddies, silk and lace robes, and sets of all combinations), corsetwear (with a small section that has some beautiful and unique lace lingerie pieces that border on steam punk and neovictorian), some club wear and dresses, couple's intimacy games, kama sutra  books and product line, male masturbators, lubes, blown glass dildos, vibrators, fleshlights, pocket pussies and various other vaginal and anal simulators, beginner to moderate level BDSM equipment (including the 50 shades sets if you're into that), kegel weights, nipple clamps, small porn selection, and all along the back wall, a plethora of shoes to the left, and different types of high end vibbrators and dildos, so like your regular Jack rabbits, then the newer model vibes, and the bigger shower suction pieces. 

They have products for him and her, her and her, him and him, and some just for when you wanna give yourself a little love. It's ok. I'll keep your secret. ;) 

Overall it was a great experience and they've certainly made a loyal customer out of me. 5 stars y'all.",Shopping
Y1XwJXAoVoWdV20JhlKgGA,62FtBrGSEfNWZwImMcMD3Q,csy-xJWM68SXabizUIhucA,2014-06-25,"As with many of the newer Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurants,Little Cleo's Seafood Legend is a great concept (that's what FRC is good at) but the delivery of that concept is wholly underwhelming. 

I have enjoyed the FRC's restaurants since I was an undergraduate at UofA in Tucson. For a college kid, the fast casual Sauce and Wildflower were awesome. Zinburger and Blanco were great for semi upscale\/familiar\/fun dining. Lastly, North was a great restaurant for a college kid to be exposed to a broader range of upscale Italian cuisine. 

But, sadly, it seems that FRC is letting its initial success go to its head! I have dined at Olive and Ivy, True food kitchen, Culinary Dropout, and now Little Cleo's Seafood Legend since moving up to the valley. For each one of these restaurants their is a common theme: The concept of the restaurant is new, intriguing, and refreshing, but the execution of the concept is sub par.

We first started off with the crab and grilled octopus small plates. 

The crab is served in a jar with warm drawn butter. There wasn't a lot of crab, but for a $12 appetizer you get as much as you pay for. It was served with a side of grilled bread. The mason-like jar that contained the small bits of loose crab meat made it hard to get the last half of the crab meat out. It somewhat makes you look like you haven't had a meal in weeks as you stir around trying to get the last morsels of the crab out of the jar to enjoy. However, this is a criticism of the presentation of the dish. The actual crab, accompanied by the best grilled bread that I have had in a long time, was very good, especially considering the price tag of only $12. I give the crab appetizer 8\/10 

The grilled octopus was less appetizing. The octopus was not at all as tender as it needed to be. Octopus will almost always have a slightly tough texture, but when trying to slice the octopus requires you to work hard to saw it into pieces(I had given up on trying to slice the skirts), it is simply not cooked long enough. Apart from the work needed, we were given three approximately 3 ounce octopi with three quarter sized crispy masa cakes. The masa cakes were delicious, and went well with the octopus, but there should have been more to compliment the octopus. The masa cakes were the highlight of the dish. I give the grilled octopus 4\/10

We also ordered the garlic fries to try while awaiting the entrees. I liked the cut of the fries, which was between the cut of steak fries and French fries, but there was no garlic flavor nor much salt for that matter. The rooster sauce aioli was not at all spicy and did not really retain siracha flavor, but was tasty. The major problem with the aioli was that the tablespoon amount was no match for the amount of fries. That left about a third of the under seasoned fries with nothing more to do than sit on the plate until the server cleared the table for the entree. I give the fries 3\/10.

Next came the ahi tuna and the Cajun shrimp. The mushroom ginger dumplings were very good and the highlight of the entree. The ahi was seared well, had a great texture, and the taste of the fish itself was good. But just like a great steak, it still needs seasoning. There was no season to be found on the tuna and there was very little of the delicious spicy caramelized soy to compliment the tuna. I give the grilled ahi tuna 5\/10 because of the dumplings, the sauce and the texture and perfect cook of the tuna. 

The Cajun shrimp was better than the tuna. That grilled bread is outstanding! The shrimp were perfectly cooked and were meaty and medium-large sized. The sauce was a touch on the salty side, but with Cajun food, if it's not slightly over seasoned then it's under-seasoned! It was spicy but the spiciness was well balanced. The corn was cooked well and not at all overcooked, the potatoes were good as well, but after the fries I was all potatoed out. I would give the shrimp 7.5\/10.

As a whole the crab and the shrimp were pretty good, but everything else was sub par. There are many, many more comparably priced restaurants that put forth much more creative, more balanced, and more delicious seafood dishes than what I experienced at Little Cleo's. 

That seems to be the problem with the newer FRC restaurants. The concepts are neat, the names are cool and edgy, the new hipster\/edgy culture is different. But in the end, it is just a facade, a marketing ploy to get people into the restaurant. The design and marketing of a restaurant should never surpass the actual food that the restaurant serves.",Restaurant
tWANPwxA23IeY5JgwUi5qA,EmRwJ3IiIX5IfN59WWJYPQ,EjgPwxGTEM4H06cqOTuphw,2014-08-25,"On 8\/23, I went to the Aveda store in PV Mall to pick out my Pure Privilege birthday gift.  Since the store was busy, I went to the makeup to see if anything interested me.  After a few minutes, an associate asked if I needed any help picking out colors.  I smiled and waved the certificate in my hand and said, ""nope - I'm here to pick out my birthday gift today!""  I was excited to pick out a new fragrance since the patchouli blend I've always worn was discontinued.   I've gone through the experience at least five or six times, so I was looking forward to sitting down and going through the options.  

The associate said, ""Oh, well, you also have your double points certificate"" and proceeded to their back room to put her drink cup away.  I continued looking at makeup.  She came back, walked to the registers and says to the customer being rung up, ""I haven't seen you in so long!"" and then chats for a moment before walking over to the table where she started pulling out the oil blends.  She didn't say a word to me.  I looked over after a minute and she had a few of the bottles uncapped and lined up.  I put down the makeup and started to walk towards the table.  She still hadn't said anything to me about how we were going to walk through the experience, if she was ready for me, what I should be doing...nothing.  So I stood about four feet away from the table waiting for her to acknowledge me.  At this point she gestured at the stool and said, ""You can sit down.""  So I did, and then I waited because she was still uncapping bottles and setting them in a row.  When I didn't reach for any of the bottles, she looked at me and said in a snide tone, ""You can start anytime.""  I was floored.  First, that she spoke to me in that tone and second because I know this isn't how Aveda does things.  Going into an Aveda store is always a treat.  You're greeted.  You're offered tea.  The associates talk to you and suggestively sell and offer you a moment of wellness.  You almost forget how much money you're spending on product because they make it an experience.

In that moment, I was so shocked that I actually just did what she told me and started sniffing the bottles.  I eliminated a few, but I still had four in front of me, and I said, ""Hmm, I can't choose between these four,"" thinking that she would ask questions to help me narrow down a choice.  I got silence.  By this point, I am not only disappointed because I'm not being ""pampered"" (which to me is more fun than the actual free product), but I'm being given the silent treatment.  There is no conversation, no ""so what are you doing for your birthday,"" no acknowledgement that I'm in there for a special treat, no acknowledgement that I'm a Pure Privilege member, nothing.  Just an associate standing next to me, alternately watching me smelling bottles and staring into space.  I assume she had better things to do than to take care of me.  

I went on to ask about the notes in the other bottles, and then because I was so awkwardly uncomfortable with the whole situation between the silence and the staring, I just picked one and said, ""This is the one I'd like.""

She flipped the bottle onto the base and let it drain.  In complete silence.  When it was done, she hurriedly stuffed it into the envelope, handed me the envelope, and chirped, ""There you go!""  She hadn't even bothered to mark the envelope with my choice.  So as she turns away from me and starts putting the bottles back, I walk over to the counter to ask to borrow a pen.  She finally gestures at me so that I cannot pretend not to see her and says to me with an exaggerated fake smile on her face (she didn't smile at me the entire time she was ""helping"" me), ""Can I help you with something?""  I said, ""I would like to borrow a pen, please, because you didn't mark down which blend I chose.""  She replies in a syrupy, cheerfully fake voice, ""Oh here, let me do that for you"" and takes the envelope from me.  She hands it back and says, ""Can I offer you a moment of wellness?""  I lost it.  I said, ""No, you can't.  You should have done that from the beginning.  You have completely ruined my birthday treat AND my afternoon.""  And I proceeded to be something I have never been in a retail store before - an incredibly angry customer.

I have gotten bad and nonexistent service in lots of places, but none that ever made me feel this way or provoked this kind of reaction from me.  I did not get the woman's name, but she had dark brown, wavy, shoulder-length hair and glasses. The team at the Fashion Sq. store have always been fabulous.  I will never go to PV again.",Shopping
MXfP9V3Zr4a10DdXr6pK5w,rCf-6fp1wPDRz0LRzx9Aag,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2010-03-18,"So many reasons why I will not stay here again.  The front desk lady was first - she just pissed me and my husband off.  Then the horrible room service we had and so many other things.  The two gentlemen in the business center were extremely cool, helpful and just awesome.  Which these two could train the front desk ladies.

Front Desk experience - We got to Vegas on sunday morning and went straight to our hotel. The lady at the front desk was a little snarky. Let me first say - my husband called ahead of time, twice actually, and explained it was our anniversary and special and could we please have a room with a strip view. He was told yes, it will be taken care of, we have a strip view. - So we give her our names and she says check-in isnt available until 11 or 12, and come back then - Just her tone and wording was so rude.  We ask snootypants if the room is a strip view - she says no its a pool view. Nicely my husband explains he called ahead and was told he did have a strip view. Attitude chick responds to us like this ""again, there is nothing I can do until 11 or 12, I suggest you come back then"" which we were fine with - just not fine with the tude on this girl.  So we decided to go to the Wynn buffet for breakfast.  After breakfast it was time for check-in.  We get back and hope we dont get the same chick, but we did. When we go to check in with snooty witch is a little bit less bitchy and immediately tells us there are only rooms with partial strip views available and not the one we requested and would this be ok, well of course its not. So politely we ask how long it would be to wait for a room with a full view. She picks up the phone - asks someone to release the rooms, and then books a full view room. Now let me ask...why the heck didnt she just do that in the first place? We get to our room finally and its a room with a strip\/fountain view. This was awesome. Last time I felt like I didnt get to enjoy the fountains, and now I get to see as many shows as I want. Perfect - the snarky one came thru for us in the end but only with us having to get irritated - not a good way to start out our stay.  To the left you see the Palms, Rio and the mountain range. My husband loved waking up and seeing the golden shine the mountains had in the morning.  To the right we had a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel tower and flamingo.  

Room - Do be careful if you take a bath - its a little tricky to get out of the tub, I almost fell twice.  Also if you move in the tub water spills over the sides constantly.  I loved the bed and the decor - the pillows and bedding were great - good night sleep.  We did have the same problem as some have mentioned with the TV - if you do something in the guide it freezes, beware.  It happened to us three times.  It wasnt the same thing, one time we just pulled up the guide and it froze.  The blackout shades I agree with someone that said they arent really blackout - they have gaps that shine right in your eyes when you are in bed - and the room was soooo freaking dusty.  

Room Service - $70 for the worst breakfast we ever had - a burrito and eggs benedict (with pork chops, not ham - beware), chocolate crossaints and orange juice and milk - $70??? oh my and dont have the potatoes,  so gross, I mean really just nasty.  Tasted like oil paste.  And they messed up my order, so I got to watch my husband eat breakfast on our anniversary, then he got to watch me once they finally brought me the right meal.  I complained because I was so pissed this is the way our anniversary started, and we were given 4 chocolate covered strawberries.  hmm - not worth it, wish I had breakfast anywhere else but here.  

Overall obviously we will not be staying here again.  I could have dealt with the bad room service - but the attitude we received just sealed the deal that we will not go back here.",Beauty
tytdu52k5FSv29tPA2xlzA,P8cIH8J8TXWN7uc1yOtiYw,Y4KpOGpf2fmuP0D-0SB4sg,2017-03-10,"We used to live in Apache Junction Arizona for several years and this place was 10 minutes from the house.  We bought our hot tub here which was a great deal and looked at the above ground pools for years without ever pulling the trigger.  The other flea markets in the phoenix area just don't hold up to the quality and volume that this place has to offer.  

Yes, it is hot during the summer months as it is covered but not inside and air conditioned like some of the other flea markets around town.  However, you get some great vendors here that don't simply offer the traditional garbage you see in an indoor market.  

The live music here is free and they have had some great performers over the years.  I recall an older lady that sang about 10 years ago who reminds me of the lady from the Adam Sandler movie, The Wedding Singer, who loved to pay for his singing lessons with her meatballs.  She was great, but this last trip a couple weeks ago I had the pleasure to hear a gentleman who was a literal one man band with renditions of AC\/DC and Journey songs on his guitar with a bass drum and some tech help.  His vocals were also very good.  He took a request from the audience of some Fleetwood Mac and explained to everyone how the song was an offbeat difficult tune and gave the names and background to the singers in the band as to who wrote it and then proceeded to kill it.  Dude had the kind of talent you sit back and listen to and say to yourself...""man I wish I had that kind of talent!""  Wouldn't that be cool.  Then you sit back and appreciate other people and what they can do.    

Food area where they play was packed and it took 20 min for a table to open up so people were enjoying the music.  I loved to watch the Korean and Vietnam military veterans with their hats enjoying life and dancing with their female dance partners like they didn't have a care in the world to those songs, but I digress.. Boy do I miss Arizona!

Nevertheless, the live entertainment is worth the price of admission, which is $0.  The 16 oz Miller lite beer is $3 and some of the shops are excellent.  Breakfast and burgers are solid and inexpensive.  There is a shop that sells cactus arrangements in a nice Arizona decorated bowl for $11 for 3 cactus or cacti of your choice.  Paper cactus (people will ask about that), red cactus, sharp, pointy, sticky.  They also have a larger $15 bowl where you get all the cactus separate and the gravel and instructions to boot.  Note the $11 bowl watering is 4 oz per week.  The cactus arrangements and deals are a total steal as you can't hardly buy a bowl let alone the plants and gravel.  They also sell them for the same price already put together.    

These flea markets have great kitchen items from bacon presses to tongs, strainers, old fashioned peelers for super cheap so it's always worth the time to look around.  I purchased and had measured a full set of Ping Golf Club knockoffs at this place.  They took all the measurements like club pro's and honestly it's the best set of golf clubs i've owned.  Think I paid around $175 for the whole set 10 years ago.  

My mother found a great greeting looking Smokey Bear ceramic item that says welcome or hello on the front and on the backside it says goodbye.  Painted well for $20 out the door.  

I was very impressed with a place that sold pictures of Superstition Mountain and Canyon Lake as we had a boat and lived within a few miles of Superstition Mountain so I have grown to appreciate the beauty of the area.  I spoke to the couple who does this and the gentleman takes his own pictures of the Arizona landscape and his pictures were available on canvas or aluminum.  The canvas IMO was the best looking and half the price, but the gallery as a whole is stunning.  I wish I took pictures to post up for others to see but I am not trying to promote businesses other than promoting the flea market as a whole since the people, the food, the entertainment and the area holds a special place in my heart.  

Check it out.  Is it the best flea market in the world?  No, but in my opinion it's the best flea market in Arizona.  It gets busy, so when it is and you want to find quick parking, stay on the right hand side of the ropes and park in the back.  There are entrances on all sides of the tents so it doesn't really matter where you start the long walking journey of slaloming through the masses.   At the end of the day it's a great place to chill and free to get in, which is always a win in my book, and always makes me smile.",Shopping
m-uoboFeKeWYdcOkPMfULw,YbDgTdMdAVZXeplS7a3jnA,JogUSDKa1xyG3lLEmD4Xjg,2013-10-26,"I really like Fiamma and go there fairly often with my wife for lunch but this visit was a disaster.  First, this place is a beautiful white table cloth restaurant but does not feel super formal.  We were promptly seated and the waitress was quickly at our table.  The food selection is extensive and the menu offers a more complex selection of dishes than your usual Italian restaurant.  We came this night with our two young children who are both under 10.  However, this restaurant is not for children.  There are no children menu options presented and nada special done for kids (forget the menus, crayons here). So we asked if we can get pasta with noodles and that was available. We also asked for Pizza but we were told they typically don't do that but because we came in early (6pm) and they were not busy yet, they can accommodate.  So we ordered pepperoni pizza for one of the kids.  We also ordered drinks, a beer and wine for my wife.  The waitress, who was really nice btw, came back a few mins later saying there is no pepperoni (strange for an Italian restaurant to have no pepperoni but I get it, this is not a pizza place after all). So we opted for just cheese.  On her next trip back, she brought our drinks which included 2 lemonades for the kids - yes, about the only kid thing they had. 

Unfortunately while setting drinks on the table she dropped the beer bottle on top of me. Beer all over the table, floor, and partly on my wool coat.  No biggie, it was an accident.  She hastily started cleaning 'some' of it and another waiter came back and gave me a couple of napkins to clean up my coat. I did not make a big deal about it because it really was just an accident. However, the cleanup was poorly done and I sat next to a puddle of beer on the floor throughout the night (she did come back about 15 mins later with a small hand towel to wipe the floor but that was a job for the mop which never came out).  

Next comes my caprese salad (tomatoes and mozzarella). This was delicious and well presented.  The kids meals came out shortly after. That was problem #2.  My daughter's pizza was BURNED on about 30% of the side, and completely RAW underneath.  I wish I would have taken a picture because this thing looked like it was baked, well, by my daughter, using a blow torch.  My guess is that what had happened was that they did not expect anyone to order a pizza so they probably fired up the oven on the spot and did not wait for it to be preheated and just put the pizza while it was heating up but that is a theory.  We called the waitress and she profusely apologized and told us it will be taken off the bill (more on this little detail later).  

We asked for just spaghetti and butter - plain, nothing else.  That came out later, but wait, it was not spaghetti but a severely overcooked flat noodle (more like a long egg noodle).  The pasta was so overcooked that it almost turned into a mashed potato like GOO as soon as my daughter tried to stir the butter into it.  By that time she had nibbled on some bread so we made no big deal about it.  
Finally our main entrees arrived. We had both ordered specials:  Lamb Osso bucco and Sea Bass.  Both were very well prepared and delicious and came promptly to the table.  When we were done we were offered dessert.  We ordered a tiramisu and asked if the coffee was fresh.  The waitress said the coffee was made just 2 hours ago - Wow, that is fresh.  Why would they make coffee at 5pm for a restaurant that was essentially empty at 6pm when we got there?  She did say it was in a sealed container so we went for it. It was not a 'bad' cup of coffee but I almost wished she would have lied and said it was just made.  
Dessert came quickly and we were surprised with a second dessert on the house to make up for the mistakes we were told. This was a nice gesture (another one to come at the very end) and both desserts were delicious. The Tiramisu was excellent, fresh and spongy but not soggy. Very well done.  

In the end we were presented with our bill which was for $140.  The specials were about $30 and $35 each and add 2 drinks, dessert, coffee, and bad kids meals and it added up. Gave my card and paid and it was on the way out that I noticed that darned burned-undercooked pizza was not taken off the menu and not only that, it was almost $11 bucks.  Yikes.  At that time we were just exhausted and wanted to flee as fast as we could. Before we got up our tables, another waiter came back and gave us two house-made limonccelos on the house, again for our trouble.   

So in the end they did gain points for trying to recover.  We did get 2 freebies as a gesture to try to make up for the experience, our main dishes were very good, and the waitress was very friendly and apologize no less than 3 times for the mistakes done.  I will give Fiamma another visit but oh man, I really hope we don't get the same bad karma from last night.",Restaurant
3AAPFUCNjV6MeShJJBv2gw,GPQ9-bYKnbqOVEfR4zQfcg,umaLhoVZz7iJZbAo2xXNzw,2013-05-01,"I love Sephora, it's practically my candy store (well, I love sugar too... so maybe it's just my non-edible candy store). Let's say I'm looking for a soft pink lipstick, but not too light. And no frosty shades - I'm not going for that 70s look. Oh, but not too dark, and definitely not sheer. But it also needs to be hydrating. Sephora's got you covered. They carry plenty of brands (more online) of makeup, skin care, body care, and fragrance, and they also cater to men and women. 

I'll be perfectly honest - I prefer (only slightly) to shop online. I seem to always want to buy from Sephora when I'm in my pajamas later at night, and unfortunately while I enjoy my nightowl (read: insomniac) life, I can't seem to find a mall open at 2am. Why do places close so early (how dare they want to go home at 9pm??!?)? Or I'll be out of town at a conference or what have you, and think, gosh, I could really use a new eye liner\/face mask\/perfume\/what have you. Sephora online is always open, and full of reviews. People on Sephora's Facebook wall may whine that shipping takes too long, but I've never waited more than a week or so, and have often times received my goods in 4-5 days. But this review was not supposed to be about online, as I do occasionally venture outside of my house. If I'm going to go to a Sephora in person, it's the one in Southpark. Sure, the parking is typically atrocious, but it's worth it.

Even when Sephora is packed, the staff still manage to acknowledge my presence (which is more than I can say for some other Sephoras - I can be in their empty store for 15 minutes and barely get them to say two words even at the check out). It's pretty easy to get assistance with anything. The last time i was in there, I had one of the employees match me for foundation - and she was meticulous (which is a good thing!) she suggested two different foundations after asking me several questions and listening to my needs, then found the perfect shade. Then she helped me find a lipstain. Even though I was being rather picky, she didn't seem annoyed and offered good advice. I didn't feel like she was selling me a more expensive lip product to make a sale, and explained why it would be exactly what I was looking for. 

Since I tend to purchase the slightly majority of my products online, that means that occasionally something just doesn't work. Reviews can be great, but sometimes they're scarce if the product is new or a shade just doesn't work. Sephora is really pretty good about returns. The last two times I've stopped into Sephora at Southpark, I had a return. I always feel bad doing it. I most recently debating returning the product (a perfume) because I hate returning (especially because I worked in retail, and I know it likely hurts their daily sales and the product is also damaged out, so it's a waste to me!). However, no Sephora around me carried this brand and it just didn't work for me. Sephora didn't make me feel guilty, and happily accepted my return (maybe because then I end up buying more stuff?) If for some reason you don't have a receipt, they can usually look up the purchase if you are a member of their Beauty Insider program (it's free, so why not sign up?). I will warn you if you get store credit (often if you don't have a receipt, but I'm sure can happen for other reasons) you can only use that in person, never online.

Also, you can get samples! Since I'm in the market for a new perfume anyway and didn't really want to keep buying and returning ones, I had them make me up a few samples - they are in a nice little spray vial so I can try them out at home and see how they wear during the day. I asked for a fragrance sample at another location and the woman handed me the bottle and told me to spray it on my wrist. I was like, ""I already have something else on and want to see how it wears, how it smells on me, and also make sure i don't get an allergic reaction (unfortunately, somewhat common for me)"". She rolled her eyes at me, especially when I dared to utter the word ""sample"" and said spraying it on my wrist WAS my sample. Oh-kay then. But anyway, if you are a member of Sephora's frequent shopper program, they email you when there are specials or new products, and you earn points that you can turn in for bonus size samples or little sets of samples (usually they're a generous travel size). If you spend enough in a year (I think it's $350) they upgrade you to ""VIB"" (very important... beauty? I don't remember), and supposedly you get extra perks (which slip my mind). If you want your makeup done, just call ahead to make sure they're able to fit you in (the weekends there are usually busy). I've had my makeup done once, and the girl did a fantastic job, and I didn't feel like she tried to do any sales pitch. She also mixed in some products that I already had (and mentioned) so I didn't feel like I needed to buy all new products.",Shopping

I came here a couple weeks ago, and booked a shellac manicure & regular pedicure, and a regular pedicure for the person that came with me. It took FOREVER. I was falling asleep in the chair because I was so bored, as the nail technician was super awkward, unfriendly and not engaging in the slightest. Whatever, not that big of a deal as I was anticipating a great end result. Unfortunately, right after I left the salon I noticed that my nail polish had been smudged on one foot. As we had already left the area, I just left it as I figured it wasn't worth it to trek all the way back to the salon just for one nail. 

However, a few days later, I noticed that my shellac was starting to chip a little bit, and then quickly after that all of my nails started to chip. Normally, my shellac lasts me AT LEAST 2 weeks. I figured this was because of the different type of shellac polish they were using (I usually use CND). Anyways, as I mentioned I don't live in the area, so I went back to my regular nail salon to get my shellac changed as I hate having chipped nails. At this point though I was pretty ticked as we had paid so much for the services, but less than a week later neither my toe nails or my shellac looked good, and I had to go pay to go have my nails changed. So, after mulling it over, I decided to go ahead and call to complain and see if I could at least have my toe nail polish fixed.

When I called, the employee said to me ""Oh I can't help you. E-mail the owner instead."" Not one apology, didn't offer to fix it, nothing. So I went ahead and e-mailed. No response. So I had to call the salon AGAIN the following day. To which the owner answered, and had mentioned she heard I had called. My first thought was well, why didn't you call me back then if you knew I had called?!?! I proceeded to explain the situation (for the third time). And, yet again, NO APOLOGY. Instead, she got all defensive and said that ""shellac isn't guaranteed to to last more than a week."" And then proceeded to go on and on about how people who are rough with their hands generally don't have their shellac last long. I'm not rough with my hands. At all. My shellac always lasts over two weeks. Come on, it should at least last more than a week?! I may as well have gotten regular polish! She literally was trying to justify her overpriced services and that this was perfectly acceptable. And when I said my polish on my toenail was smudged and I just wanted my ONE nail fixed, she again tried to say that it was my fault that I hadn't called earlier and that she couldn't do anything for me. SHE COULDN'T FIX ONE SINGLE NAIL. And then said that she ""doesn't train her staff to rush clients out"" (which is quite obvious as it took over two hours) but my nails still weren't properly dried. She didn't apologize once, and just got all defensive and was saying that everything was all my fault. 

HORRIBLE experience. My nails looked good for about 2 days. I honestly have no idea how this place made the top 10 list on blogTO for best manicures, because this place sucks and the attitude & customer service skills are SERIOUSLY lacking. Because of the owners inability to apologize and properly handle a customer complaint, I will never be back and I will make sure I tell every single person I know not to go to this nail salon. It's overpriced for the services you get, and the owner simply does not know how to run a business and how to treat her clients. Had she resolved the situation properly and maybe even offered nothing but an apology, I would have given the salon another chance. WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!!",Beauty

Hilton or Marriott, with a few unfortunate instances of Motel 6 thrown in to keep me humble. That's because the only other option used to be incredibly snooty, stuffy and expensive fancy show-off hotels (and I've stayed in most of them as well). Then a few years ago a new kind of hotel started popping up with trendy names, trendy décor, trendy guest policies and yet budget-friendly rates.

The Found:Re is one of those trendy places. At 10 months into operation it's still relatively new as I write this and my first word of advice is don't even read those first dozen or so reviews that blasted them for not being perfect in the hotel's initial few weeks of operation. Not that all is well with them, not after 10 months of operations when we should reasonably expect the opening day jitters to have been smoothed out.

Before going on with this let me make it clear that the Found:Re is NOT downtown nor is it in the heart of any action. In reality it's surrounded by retirement apartments, a nice but sedate park and fun places like churches and libraries. But to get to downtown or to the action you can simply walk out the front door and hop on Phoenix's relatively decent light rail train, which will even take you directly to the airport.

This hotel is stellar, almost out of place in conservative buttoned down Phoenix. The design, the flow, the art, the people, the bathrooms, the knock-your-socks-off balcony suites, the restaurant\/bar.  And at least while they're new and it's off-season the standard room rates are crazy CHEAP!!

Oh yeah, those bathrooms. The any gender johns in lobby for example, some of which have one-way mirrors so the joke's on the person standing on the other side prettying themselves up while you're in there doing your business watching them (of course the REAL joke is that they're not really one-way mirrors ... those people on the other side can see everything you're doing). The other exhibitionist bathrooms are the ones in some of the guest rooms, the showers have clear glass walls and no doors. If you happen to be rooming with your grandmother or a nun, maybe you may want to suggest they look out the window at the awesome view while you clean up. (Okay some of this stuff isn't really true, but it sounded funny).

The Found:Re is definitely not in the heart of what anyone would call action unless you enjoy watching seniors on motorized scooter races. 

Oh, by the way, if you book through a third-party and they don't tell you about the deposit to your credit card or the rather hefty valet fee you can't really blame the hotel, can you? My on-site reservation agent was spot-on explaining all of the above and more. There were no surprises, just a chill way to get out of the house on a Saturday night and unlax at Phoenix's most unique new hotel.

However not all is 100% rosy in Found:re Land. Some of the not-so-good things probably aren't very correctable, like for example the design of the shower pretty much guarantees the rest of the bathroom floor will get flooded. And the cement floors in the guest rooms are sure to give you cold feet. They are among dozens of little things I found that probably looked a whole lot better on the designer's drawing table than in real-life execution.

Then there are some things that aren't that forgivable for a hotel that's been open to the public for almost a year. High on that list are the deer-in-the-headlights wait staff in the dining room named Match (which I review separately). The entire restaurant operation seems to be severely lacking in management. The servers don't know what they're serving and worse, don't seem to care. The open kitchen idea probably sounded like a great idea to someone, but not when you can hear the chefs arguing how much of an ""upcharge"" to hit a customer with for requesting a substitution. Cringeworthy!  The people at the front desk don't act like normal front desk staff in a hotel, and that could be cool but they really don't act cool either ... just bored. The swimming pool area stylistically looks like it belongs in a Motel 6 but who came up with the idea of closing it at 10 PM on a Saturday night?  I thought this place was supposed to be trendy and hipster?

With all the concrete and hard surfaces the hotel is one noisy place, you can hear every footstep and hear voices from several rooms away. Add that to the insanely loud air conditioner and the trolley horn right below honking every few minutes and this hotel becomes an earplug mandatory zone.

None of the above is reason to scratch the Found:re off your list, they are just missed opportunities on the hotel's part, many of which are correctable. They need to bring in an outside consultant to give them some advice on how to make what they deliver match what they promise.

The bottom line is the place is a welcome change from cookie-cutter me-to hotels and I'm generally happy with our little staycation visit.",Shopping

The only employee appeared to be a guy pulling double duty.  He came up front in a timely manner from his workshop in the back of the store...but that is where the praise ends.

Remember this as you read on...if you are an artisan or craftsman sometimes it's better to stay at the workbench plying your trade and let an an individual with some sales experience handle the customers, lest you scare them away.

After the rude treatment I received at Freij jewelers, research lead me to http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HEW28q3sjmQ.  Is it any wonder this place is all sizzle and no steak?  Since when is a woman dressed in a skimpy  animal skin the authority on jewelry?  I found she is used in several other videos like this in businesses across Vegas.

The guy in the video is the poster boy for the what used car salesmen are know for - the ""hard sale"".

He tries to nail you down on price right away so as to direct you to a diamond that will bring the greatest profit for him...not the best deal for the customer.  I did NOT tell him what I was willing to pay, explaining that it depends on the quality of the diamond but that I was not going 
to pay more than $3000.

So what did he do after I choose a diamond to look at?  He priced it at $2900 which was ridiculously over priced for that particular diamond even for jewelry stores that have high rent to pay at the local malls.  When I balked, he dropped the price to $2000...so much for giving the customer a fair price from the get go.

Take note, that method of doing business is is the trademark of a ripoff artist.  At www.diamondhelpers.com (a site that screens jewelry stores by acting like secret shoppers) says this:  ""If the first price offered (by the jeweler) is not an excellent price, we hang up and move on.""  Great advice.  You should do the same.

He also claims that all of his jewelry new.  Liar!  The piece I looked at 
had PLENTY of scuff marks...a dead ringer that it has been well worn!  He claimed that was due to ""polishing"" the diamond. Really??  Did the polish the band and mount to cause those scuff marks too?  Puh...lease!

After he was caught in a lie, he argued with me about pawn shop diamond prices.  He said they take advantage of people selling their jewelry.  True.  But that is how that business works.  Pawn shops provide instant cash to those that need it instantly.  What would you expect?  Hence, that is how they make their money.  Buy low sell high...duh!?!?  

Based on this experience, Friej jewelers is WORSE than a pawn shop.  They sell used jewelry for over twice market value passing it off as new. Hmmm.  

Unlike pawn shops and mall jewelers, Freij does NOT have tags (price\/description of the diamond) on their jewelry.  This gives them free rein to lie about the diamond quality and gouge the unwary customer.

After he found out I was educated about diamonds he refused to show me another piece.  In other words, his motto is 'if he can't screw you over, why waste time making an honest sale?'  

Here is my advice to Freij jewelers:  

Instead of making YouTube videos focusing on sexy women dancing in your store why not give customers something of value.  Best to hire a greeter with some ""counter manner"" so you can keep your grumpy craftsman at his bench where he belongs.  Your return on marketing dollars will be better spent.  Word of mouth advertising from happy customers reaches the market quicker and is FREE!

My advice to fellow Yelpers:  

Stay away from Freij unless you know ALOT more than the four C's of diamonds and are willing to pay for an inferior product.  I received better treatment at several EZ-Pawn stores and witnessed higher quality diamonds at fair prices.",Shopping
djNReLagN1BwBAraC0UdqA,s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,bfawyFZbVh8oBmKx-uTL8Q,2014-05-07,"The average for this home depot is 3 stars and I say nay- you have not yet earned that 3rd star Home Depot- you get 2 stars. I have been here a few times getting your run of the mill stuff- trash bags, paint, a pick to expand the hole in my basement- the usual. My only negative experience until recently was I bought a grill that came with free assembly but whoever assembles them was apparently on vacation and couldn't do it for a week or so -so I put it together myself and am now terrified that it will explode. 

Last night, however, when I went to get a drink from my trusty fridge my taste buds were assaulted by water that could loosely be called ""tap"". Surely this must be a mistake, I mused out loud, because I had just replaced the filter not two months prior. I checked the filter light and it was not on- I was allegedly good. I tasted the water again and sure enough- it was disgusting, unfiltered proletariat water. ""THIS WILL NOT STAND!"" I screamed, picking up the bell I ring to alert my butler to my needs. After ringing it for about 45 minutes I realized my roomate was not in fact home and I would have to take care of this myself. 3 hours later I had figured out how to remove the filter and was looking online for a replacement. 

Now, according to the home depot website there were a variety of products they offered that would fit my needs. There was a name brand, a generic, and each offered them in a single or two pack. The two pack of the generic was the best value but since I'm a BALLER I planned on getting the single of the name brand because I make it rain like that. The website has a cool feature entitled ""check for availability in store"" and what this feature does is it allows you to check for the availability of your product in the store. I checked and sure enough- all four were available at this location. 

To recap- they allegedly have 4 different products that will fit my needs in stock. So I jump in my automobile, smash the accelematrix and I'm off. At the last possible second a nagging voice in the back of my mind said, ""you know what,just in case why don't you bring the old filter with you- worst case scenario you can just throw it out in the store when you buy the new one"". While I am usually a risk taker -I play the stock market, blackjack, go out with girls who live downtown- for some reason I listened to aforementioned voice and brought it with me.

I arrived at the store and by the time I had walked 20 feet had been asked by about 7 employees if they could help me. Having been worn down I said ""You know what Steve? You can"". I showed him the website for what I wanted and he said ""No problem"". Little did Steve know- there was a big problem. Apparently water filters are slightly more valuable than plutonium so they are always kept hidden or under lock and key or both. At this particular location apparently they are also kept in like 5 different locations. After walking around for some time it turned out the product was not available in store- a major defect in the ""check availability in store"" system. Not only was my first choice not available, neither were any of the other ones. 

:(

At this point another employee overheard us talking and informed us there was in fact a secret 6th location where filters could be found. Once we found this El Dorado of tap water it turned out they did have the generic filter in a one pack that I needed- but the price was like 14 dollars more than advertised on the website. At this point I had invested 5's of minutes into getting it though so I bit the bullet and shelled out the money instead of ordering online\/waiting for it. 

In closing, Amazon for little shippable things. Home depot for other things. This review is slightly exaggerated- but I emphasize SLIGHT.",Shopping

The NEW Campus Commons is possibly THE best kept secret in the general area due to it's impressive gathering of several individual eateries with their own unique flavors as well as a community vibe. 

Yes i know Brian the owner. The other guy behind the counter is Brandon his brother that holds down the shop when Brian is out doing other stuff. I've eaten here a few times and i've passed them up a few times and i'd like to share why i keep on coming back.

The Flavors
Now if you think there's 40 flavors as advertised you're wrong. The count i'd estimate now would be around 60 flavors with a lot more in the works. A unique thing about Brian is the gears inside his head are always turning and cranking out new flavors. The latest set of flavors (new during this re-review) all contain contain the word 'Slam' in them because he 'Slammed' them together that afternoon.
So far my all time favorite flavor are any of the Jamacian Jerk flavors. Standard is quite balanced with a layer upon layer of different flavors starting from some sweetness then some tangy savory, then herbal, then aromatics, and finally a steady rising heat from spicy.  The Apple Jerk is a bit sweeter but the latest being the Jamacian Slam is my new favorite with it's cinnamon notes

The Option to Taste and Pick What You Want
Lets say you're torn between a few flavors or want to give a taste of what new. Ask Brian or Brandon to try out the sauce. Time after time they've shown remarkable patience and a willingness to grab the sauce bottles and give you a taste as well as explain to you the origins of the sauce and it's various other similar flavors or new flavors that have emerged from that once sauce.

Tweek the Flavor
Lets say you choose a flavor but it's a bit spicier then you expected. This happens to me on a few occasions. I dont handle spicy all too well so i asked to cut the spicy by a third. They did it and it came out perfect. It's too spicy for you or not spicy enough? Ask them to crank it up or tweek it down. All sauces are made in house so they'd be more then willing to accommode you. 

The Fries
To be honest i love the regular fries. It's a mixture of the Seasoned dry rub flavor and a bit of the Cajun dry rub flavor but to me it's perfect for fries. Their fries dont come out of a plastic bag that's been frozen for a while. You are eating real washed skin on potatos and you can tell they are too, no two fries are the same and they all taste good. A new option is available to season your fries in different flavors as well. Garlic Parm is a huge hit among the masses as well as Sweet Chili. Be warned as these are better dine in then to go as the fries get soggy if you dont eat them fast enough.

There's Always Room for Dessert
Desserts are also all home made and made in house. The usual lineup of desserts include a Red Velvet cake, their Too Much Chocolate cake, chocolate cookies, and everyone's favorite: the Peach Cobbler. If you're lucky there will be something different. I struck gold on two occasions when there was a soaked Rum cake available one day and a few weeks later a German Chocolate cake with the coconut cream center.

Bottom line. If you're hungry and in the mood for a whole lot of flavors that wont leave you broke till next week. Wing King is the place to check out. If you're on a diet and dont think you should be eating wings or desserts, come anyway. Pretty sure Brian can season a basket of celery sticks for ya.",Restaurant

We wanted to be away from the noise and over-populated Strip area. The Red Rock is about 30 minutes from the Strip area, so it's quiet. The rooms are well insulated from noise - we could barely hear any of the fireworks on the 4th.

First I'll lay out the positives:

The room is very tastefully decorated. Our room was on the 18th floor and they asked us if we wanted a view of the Strip or the mountains. We opted for the Strip view - very picturesque. The bathroom rocks!  It comes with a private toilet area, a walk-in shower and a huge soaking tub. It's big enough for two. It even comes with a scale that told me I lost some weight in the week I was here. Nice scale. I love that the tub area has its own small wall-mounted TV (even though the remote would not work) but I wasn't fond of having to operate buttons (at the top) with wet fingers.

One morning, we had room service and while the food was really delicious, the prices were ridiculous. Should breakfast cost $70 for two people?

The three times we utilized the concierge desk, they were quite helpful. They even took our cell number and texted us addresses of places we were interested in.

There's an area (just outside the main red doors) for pets to relieve themselves. There's even a station for bags and a bin for the filled bags.

The pool area was really impressive, but the amount of screaming children made us not want a dip in the pool.

Demerits:

We booked three weeks in advance, and I had made SURE our room would have a mini-fridge. What they elected not to tell me was that their mini fridge was stocked and has sensors that if anything was removed that we'd be charged for the items. LAME. So I called about the fridge I was promised since I'm a Diabetic and need to refrigerate my insulin and my meds. Not to mention I travel with my own water and emergency juice if my sugar level drops. We were told to remove items from the room fridge until they could find my one - they were all out of them apparently - because people lie about their medical needs. Well, when our service tech was up to the room for a light that was out and batteries for a remote and our smoke alarm, they called and told the hotel that I was not faking it because he saw my medical supplies. A fridge was removed from someone's office and put into our room about 3 hours later.

One morning our hot water wasn't, so we took a cool shower. After that morning the water was HOT the remainder of our stay.

We stayed over the 4th of July weekend and were told weeks ago that there would be a fireworks show at the hotel. They actually did it on the 2nd and we missed it because we assumed it would be on the 4th. We wound up watching various shows from our 18th floor window.

They include the use of the spa area... hot tubs and cool pools, steam rooms, etc. Problem is that it's clothing-optional (something we were not told) because I expected to be able to use the hot tub with my girl, instead I would have been relegated to seeing old naked men... NOPE! They do have one pool that is co-ed but they picked this weekend to do some repairs, so being with my honey was not an option. LAME. 

One evening, my girl wanted a bit of vodka. She didn't check the price of the medium bottle before she opened it - $50!!!!!  Really?

I'm not fond of using valet because i just don't want strangers in my car.  And since we were in and out of the car so often, tips would have just been astronomical after all was said and done. The self-parking is kind of ridiculous as well. It is so blistering hot in there, it made trips to the car quite agonizing. Hey, how about installing misters or fans? The level 3 parking fills up rather quickly, so level 4 parking means trips on two elevators. Level 5 parking is on the roof so your vehicle just bakes.

UPDATE: On our check out day, we were watching the clock...it was 9:30 and we took a shower and then ""got busy."" Well, a housekeeper decided she needed to just open our door. No knock - no nothin' and just opened our door. Really embarrassing and kind of unprofessional.",Beauty

Price: $165 for a 3 course
Meal Options:  3 or 5 course fixed meal only
Wine: Extensive Wine List (A+)
Dress: Sophisticated

I'm sad to say though that my experience wasn't as good as some others in this forum. I have mixed feelings since some points were positive while others weren't so much. My boyfriend and I came here dressed up (suit and cocktail dress). The dinning room did look grand and sophisticated. It made me feeling like I'm in ballroom. I love the colors. The only thing I wasn't super fond of was the flowers all over curtains. I'm assuming they are fake flowers, not dried up flowers. It made the curtains look very tacky. I think the curtains by themselves would have done justice to the room as is. 

We weren't given an option to sit in the patio, but since it was cold, I didn't mind sitting indoors. Since I was indecisive about making a selection with what wine to go with, the waiter was kind enough to allow me to sample between two. It made a huge difference because the one I originally wanted to go with, I end up not liking it as much. After we picked our pre-fixed selections, we were given a sampler, courtesy of the chief.  It was yummy and very kind of them. But I later noticed that everyone in the room got one courtesy of the chief so it didn't really feel that special anymore. But that's okay, I was still very happy with it. The scallop soup was my boyfriend's favorite. I liked them all though because they were all so different. Just a note, I think this sampler isn't always the same. Another yelper had something else.

1st Course: Appetizer

The oysters were beautifully placed on a huge bed of salt. It was delicious.
The lobster was slightly over cooked and my boyfriend wasn't too happy about that. He feels that for what you're paying, everything should be perfect. There should be no oversight.

2nd Course: Main Course
The Rabbit and Veal were delicious. At this point of the evening, Alex came out and greeted every party individually. That was really cool to see the chef.

3rd Course: Dessert
Wow is the best word to describe it. We had a lot of dessert. Alex was kind enough to give us a platter of different types of dessert aside from what we ordered. The Madelines were really good and soft. It was warm, like it was just out of the oven. We ordered the Malted Chocolate and Banana Napoleon and it was okay. The Roasted Pineapple Basque with Vanilla Crisps and Coconut Sorbet was really good and I do recommend that.

At the time of reservation, I did let the operator know that my boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary. At the end of our meal, they gave us a dessert with a little cracker saying ""Happy Anniversary"". That was very sweet of them. 

A Yelper mentioned that they received macarons when they left Alex. I got the same thing so I was super excited to try it. I'm sad to say, but it just wasn't good. I've had macarons at different places before and it just doesn't even come close to comparing. I do like the variety, but it was dry. I let my expert Macaron friend try it too, and she said it wasn't good either.

Overall, I have mixed reviews of this restaurant. It was good, but it wasn't great. Like another yelper said, ""it was good, but not memorable"". I think if the food was more consistent, I would give it a higher rating. The service was terrific and I did really enjoy the ambiance. I especially liked that they had a little chair for my bag. That was very classy. My boyfriend said he had better fine dining experiences at another restaurant which costs about the same. As a result, I'm giving it 3 and 1\/2 stars.

So the bf bought me a 50min Swedish and got me a haircut in the salon, since hes an employee he got a discount so the total was around 200$

I was soooo pissed at the end of the ""experience"" First I started off at the spa and got my massage, the guy front desk person was very nice and today the older girl was also pretty nice. I was like 5 minutes late so they were rushing me (which was annoying as hell!) They got me into the back and the attendant back there was the NICEST girl in the entire spa! She got me my locker and gave me a robe (which did not fully cover my Latina ass and hips, BOO!) and swept me to the back weird hallway to get massaged. My masseuse was Emma (I think) Tall blonde lady, very nice. She took me to my room and told me to get under the covers. I did so and she came in and started. I asked her which was the best massage because I had been in a few car accidents and she advised me Swedish was good for first times(my first time!!) and I was like ok... I needed something hard not a soft massage.

She started on my back and put some lotion on my back and started. I was waiting for her to go a little harder and after 10 mins I told her to be a little rougher(I guess?) and she did so. I told her my back really hurts and that I had a ton of knots and she worked on my back for about 20 minutes. I figured she would work on it for like 30mins but she started on my legs and feet... I really didnt need that massaged at all! So she did that for like 10 mins and I turned over and she did my shoulders and head (shoulders felt good!!) and then she was finally done... and I was left wanting more because my back still hurt and I was not at all relaxed! So I go and put my clothes on to get my haircut and I was walking out to the salon and noticed it was only 4:58pm!! So I know that I arrived 5 mins later and it took about 10 mins to get checked in and change and go back there... then it took about 10 mins to get dressed and fix my hair. So basically I had like a 35 min massage! UGH!! At the end I had 22$ left and the girl asks me what I wanted to do with it? "" You didn't leave gratuity for the masseuse so do you just want to leave that for her?"" Seriously? a 22$ tip!? I had no choice because it was a gift certificate and she didnt give me an options. Stupid beezy! 

I was REALLY EXCITED to get my haircut because I hadnt had one in almost 10 months and was ready for one! I would normally NEVER go to a ""spa\/salon"" for a haircut, but had no choice since my bf got me the package. I go in and check in and some short lady with curly hair takes me to the back. I sit down and she asks me how I want my hair cut. I tell her I want lots of volume and layers, I asked if she had any books I can look at real quick and she asked the girl who sits around and does nothing to get her one. She then gives it to me with an attitude (I shoulda slapped her stupid braid off the side of her head!) and I look through it, I didnt see anything I liked so I showed her an old picture of how I wanted me hair done. She was like ""ok I try and do that"" TRY?! REALLY TRY? I was like WTF? If you work in a salon in a spa I think you should KNOW how to cut hair. So she asked how much she could cut off and I said however much you think. I told her I didnt think my end were that fried and she was like ""uhhh yea they are!"" I was sooo irritated with her at this point... She had me stand up to cut my hair?! WTF I've gone to other SALONS and I have never had to stand up to get a hair cut... I didnt mind but it was weird. So she started cutting and what normally took my old girl almost an hr took her like 15 mins. She was like ""ohh this haircut is really easy!"" Yea it was easy because she did it HALF ASSED and wrong! She started blow drying my hair and was like ""it looks cute"" I looked and was instantly angered! My layers were long and it was un-even! I asked if she could cut the layers more and texturize it since it was soooo thick. She did so and it still looked fuggin HORRIBLE! I've NEVER had a hair THIS BAD! I had one close to this bad at supercuts, but I only paid 10$! At the end I could tell if I woulda said please try and fix it, it woulda got worse and I woulda had to punch a bitch! If this lady would have focused on me and NOT ON OTHER STYLISTS CONVOS AND BEING NOSEY AND SSAYING HOW MUCH SHE WANTED SALT maybe my hair would look ok. 

My bf thinks I'm over reacting but 6+inches are gone, my layers are messed up, and for 90$ the haircut should be gold! I'm still freakin pissed and hate this salon! I had to come home and cut parts where it was sooooo uneven you could spot it a mile away! STAY AWAY FROM THIS SALON! I'm very upset! I'm gonna have to wait another 10 months to grow my hair back to get a decent haircut.

I'll get the 2 positives out of the way... the staff was friendly and I like the overall atmosphere of the place.

Unfortunately the negative list is much much longer but I'll try and keep it brief.

First red flag was that the place was totally empty about 4:30 pm.  Just 1 couple at the bar.

Ordered a soda and water and the water itself was probably the worst tasting water I have ever had in my life.  In fairness I've never been to Rio or Flint... but it was really really bad.  This concerned me since this very well could be the water they use for cooking.  

Clam Chowder was more of a corn chowder.  They don't have crackers but offered to bring croutons instead.  But not very good at all.  Little did I know that would be the highlight of our meal.

Ordered fish tacos which had no taste whatsover.  If I didn't know what I ordered... I would have had no clue.  It was pure mush battered and fried with tasteless slaw and sauce.  I didn't even bother eating the second one... and I'm fat and rarely don't finish meals.

Wife ordered killer shrimp which was over priced and the sauce was bland.  Guess we were expecting something with flavor or some kick and it had neither.  Served with some bread which just tasted old... it wasn't hard... just tasted old.... if they bake it there... perhaps the water made it taste funny.  Decided we would try some butter since my daughter wanted bread.  The butter was grainy and sort of had a faintly buttered grits type taste and texture  I don't know how else to describe it... I mean there is no reason that I should be critiquing butter right?  But they gave me no choice b\/c it was so odd and gross.  Also.. the portion size was 1\/2 pound of shrimp with shell on for $17 which seems awfully high... especially when sauce was weak.  I believe Hot & Juicy Crawfish is much better and quite a bit less expensive if I recall...

Had calamari which wasn't terrible.... but had some breading issues.  Fell off and no taste.  The dipping sauces weren't very good and the cocktail sauce tasted very cheap and watery.  

Kids meal was chicken fingers and the batter just crumbled off the super dry and overcooked chicken.  (The breading seemed quite different than the calamari but they managed to mess up both)  Fries weren't bad... but even the ketchup taste weird.  I actually joked about trying the ketchup just to see if it tasted wierd too and I was shocked to find that it did in fact taste weird.  

At this point I'm questioning if I am sick where everything tastes funny but unfortunately for Killer Shrimp... I'm as healthy as can be.

Wrapped up our meal and debated on whether to complain or not... but what can u say when everything was bad.  How could they even make it right without just refunding the whole meal knowing there was no chance we would ever come back... so we chalked it up as a loss and moved on.  

Bus boy came to our table as we were just beginning to wrap things up.  Seemed to be urgently trying to clean the table and be in our way as we were finishing our drinks and packing up the 2 kids.  I guess they desperately needed our table since they now had 3 tables occupied so it was necessary to rush us off.  

One last thing that was odd.... the straws for the sodas were literally the same height as the glass.... so that made drinking a little more interesting... luckily I have big lips and could reach the miniature straw.

The menu also doesn't have any pictures... not that this is always a big deal... but I would think that a place like this would benefit by showing a few of their dishes since you don't see places like this everyday and should be easy to make the dishes look appealing in pictures anyways.  Seems very poorly run and won't be surprised when it is gone in 6 months.  Very disappointing.",Restaurant

It's been a tradition with my family to wind down the summer with a visit or two to the CNE.  (But even tradition has it's faults.)  Here's a list of the good and the bad reasons to the CNE.

The Good:

-  The Food:  You have classic carnival food (cotton candy, funnel cakes, waffles & ice cream, pizza in a cone), along with different ""ethic"" food.  This year is a bit better, as the CNE features gourmet food trucks and heart attack inducing foods like deep fried oreos and the Cronut burger (Yes, I know people got food poisoning - it's hard to process food safely at rocket speed!).  They even have a ribfest location, featuring some of the companies who won awards for smoking and grilling that cut of meat!  The food vendors are a bit spaced out, although - don't expect to see all the food vendors inside the food building.  Two of the vendors I always visit are the Tiny Tims (fried balls of dough - think Timbits straight outta the oil, and dusted with flavour powder!), and any pizza booth.

-  The Staff:  Generally, there are two kinds of staff members for the CNE.  You have the private vendors (individuals who have rented a space to sell you something), and the general staff that the CNE hires.  The CNE hires mostly younger individuals - the kids who are working part-time and will head back to school right after they work.  The staff is excellent and provides wonderful service.  (Ask them a question, and they will happily answer or guide you in the right directin.)

-  The Shows:  On any given day, you can see an ice show, an air show (ow, it's loud), tribute bands (Elvis anyone?), oldie but goodie singers (Petula Clark, Frankie Avalon, The Platters...the list just goes on), and random comedians\/stage acts.  You'd find something for the whole family here!  Just get to the venue 30 minutes before the posted showtimes - the lineup's a bitch.  The farm\/animal petting zoo is pretty cool for younger kids, and also features some free games and activities for 'em.

*  My parents and I caught an interesting act today in the International Stage.  A Filipino cultural act, with songs and dancing from different eras of development.  The acts here are always solid and well trained!  This group did a great job with the costumes, props and drumming.

The Bad:

-  The Rides:  I'm a huge scaredy kitty when it comes to rides, but the variety of rides here sucks.  I know, it's a temporary setup, but the company that does these rides kind of lacks.  There's always the thrill rides (eg. the Zipper, the Gravition, the Polar Express), but there's a lack of really good rollercoasters and haunted houses.  Plus, the fact that the CNE no longer sells the ""Play All Day"" pass and relies on selling tickets to the rides...it sucks.

*  Also - the ""new"" alpine ride is way smaller than the original.  The original was a huge building stuck near where BMO Fields and another building near the International Trade Center.  It was a huge ride, and took you a couple of storeys in the air.  (My dad refused to ride it, and always met my mother and I at the other end!)  It was massive and impressive, and you could see the entire grounds at once in the air.  The new one...just looks like a ski lift gone wrong.

-  The Lineups:  Yes, I know the CNE serves a metric shit ton of people.  Getting a table or a seat in the food building is a pain, and also trying on the nerves.  There are always crowds of people and even going to the bathroom is a pain.

-  Parking:  You could pay The Ex $30 to park in their covered parking garage, or park outside the grounds for a bit less.  The best bet?  Take the Bathurst streetcar directly down to the grounds.

-  The Prices:  As I said, I've been going for a long while (since I was 6 or 7), and these prices have slowly been going up.  It's a (sticker?) shock to see a bag of Tiny Tims for five dollars, and a carnival game that costs $5 per play.  I remember in my youth (I'm 29, see?) that those exact same games cost $1 or fifty cents to play.  Admission also costs $16 now, up from $10 in my youth.

Advice:

-  Bring sunscreen, a jacket (yes, it gets bitterly cold at night - and try getting stuck on a fenris wheel with a friend with no jacket...achoo!), and a refillable water bottle.  You'd thank me later.

-  Buy tickets in advance.  Tickets are sold a couple weeks before opening day, and you save a couple of bucks and also save the hassle of lining up for your tixs.  Just walk on in!

-  If buying stuff from the vendors, wait until the last weekend (August 31 - September 2), they are much more willing to haggle!

-  It's a great place for tourists or a date.  Many a night was spent courting some random pretty girl from my school.

sfn6cLkLNxZDpSa13oabWw,nZd59lcp8sh3mvq-FHhx7g,cMSEUCKmX8kRIU-31BSlLw,2014-08-16,"Oh WAXON... how I loath you...  

This is a long review, so if you don't feel like reading, just skip to the last paragraphs.  

Alright, so my first experience at Waxon was pretty good.  I was so happy to have found a place so close to where I work to get a good eyebrow threading done.  So happy, in fact, that I bought the ""Wax to the Max"" package with them that very day.  What is that, you ask?  You pay a set fee (for eyebrows it's $140, I think) and you can go in as many times as you want for a full year.  Great deal, I thought.  Unfortunately, not so...  I was a sucker.  

For those people reading this, please think about it:  I can now get my eyebrows done as many times as I want at Waxon without paying anything extra, and I STILL refuse to go back!  I mean, this review is brutally honest, so I can't go back now anyway.  That's how bad it is...

The thing is, once you buy the package, they have no incentive to keep you loyal.  Shima, the girl that does eyebrow threading at this location, progressively got worse and worse.  So bad, in fact, that they ended up crooked, with one side being much longer and thicker than the other.  As I started to notice how bad they were looking, I kept telling myself it was okay (I felt bad for having invested in the Wax to the Max package and was determined to get my money's worth).  However, after my last time at this place, I decided to just write it off.  So if you sense some anger in this review, that's where it's coming from.  I paid $140+tax for about 5 eyebrow threadings.  Kind of a rip off, right?  I imagine that anyone in a similar situation would feel the same. 

More details on the eyebrow job...

Shima typical spent about 5 minutes on my eyebrows.  This isn't because she's quick and efficient - it's because she always misses spots and cuts them unevenly.  ""Always"" isn't an exaggeration, either - it's happened every time.  She doesn't use a tweezer to pick up missed hairs.  Then she'll draw the eyebrows back on with brow powder, and it looks terrible (really thick and obvious it's drawn on).  What's worse is it hides the bad job she does.  It's only when you get home and wash your face that you come to the sad realization that your eyebrows look like ####.

In all fairness, some pros:

- Excellent online booking system.  Super easy and convenient for customers.
- The place is spotless.  
- Good location if you work downtown\/in the PATH.
- They've always been on schedule with appointments.  However, they don't seem to be that busy, so that may explain this.  
- The brow powder, which I purchased, is good stuff when I apply it myself.
- They offer you a Waxon branded bottle of water when you come in.  I'm mentioning this because I haven't been to another place that does this, so I guess it's a value-add.  Not because I care about getting a free bottle of water and it certainly doesn't make up for poor service.  

All the things I listed above are great, but so many businesses get caught up in the frills and forget the fundamentals.  Unfortunately, WAXON Wax Bar falls into this category.  

I'm not usually very vocal if I get a bad job.  I just refuse to go back (and occasionally rant on yelp).  I was going to leave this one alone, but what's funny is Shima actually had the nerve to ask me to go on Yelp and review the place!  I mean, you're lazy with your service and you're kind of rude.  Why would I recommend this place to unsuspecting potential customers? 

Actually, as a side note, go look at  the good reviews from people who have only reviewed once - these show up in the reviews Yelp doesn't recommend.  Is this because they had such a great job that they felt compelled to jump online and review, or because they were asked to?  It's misleading and very poor business practice to ask your customers for Yelp reviews.  You want good reviews?  Earn them legitimately.  Another point against Waxon.

Advice to fellow Yelpers - don't go here.  But if you do, DON'T get suckered into buying ""Wax to the Max""- I mean it.  You may end up with a similar experience.  And considering how bad this place is and how expensive rent on the PATH is, I don't expect them to be in business very long anyway, so you may not get an entire year to use the package.  

I can't trust them to do a good job, so even without having to pay anything additional, I won't go back.  My eyebrows finally look normal again, and I'm not risking it.  So yah, here is the review you asked for WAXON... I hope you read it.",Beauty
aqddf2CHD1E5eL54YIEEKg,GPQ9-bYKnbqOVEfR4zQfcg,c_5--h3KEQqo4xw_bpc5HQ,2013-06-21,"I actually think that Alterations Express deserves zero stars, but that's not an option so one star it is. I had never used Alterations Express, and will never again (and they're kind of missing out since I'm short and need everything hemmed). I brought my wedding dress here to be altered. It wasn't a super complicated alteration, and the dress wasn't very fancy (it was just an off the rack ivory dress from Macy's) since we were just eloping at City Hall. However, in the end, I was in tears. I'm still annoyed about it, and have rarely experienced such atrocious customer service.

The dress needed hemmed, and taken in. Paid extra for a rush order....which wasn't done on time. They tried to talk me into picking it up 2 or 3 days later (for the same price). I tried to explain that I needed it by a certain day because it was for a wedding. I felt like the upcharge was a little high, but I figured it would be worth it. I also thought it was a little weird that one of the layers of fabric was just in the front (so not a ton of hemming) but I was charged slightly higher than the other layers. 

The night before my wedding, I show up a little after 5pm (as instructed per the receipt) to try on the dress, make sure it's perfect, and go home with my dress. Except.... first they couldn't find my dress. They tried telling me that I didn't drop it off. I politely said, no I did and here's my receipt. They rolled their eyes, and still tried to tell me that I didn't leave the dress there (so I handed them $150 for nothing more than a small receipt?). Maybe the woman pitied me or wanted to prove that she was right and my dress wasn't there, so she decided to go look again. At this point, I was told that they LOST IT. I was super proud that I didn't yell or scream or swear or name call. I stood my ground and politely asked that they look again b\/c it's my wedding dress. After almost 15 minutes they found it... and it's not altered. 

They tried telling me it'd be ready Friday. I explained thank you, but no, I'm getting married Wednesday so Friday won't work - plus um, I PAID for it to be ready before then. The woman said, ""Oh, but Friday is fine. It'll be ready in time for Wednesday"". I tried to explain I needed it THIS Wednesday (and the receipt didn't just say ""Tuesday after 5pm"" but rather ""Tuesday May 14 after 5pm"". Then she had the audacity to tell me it was my fault that the dress wasn't altered b\/c I didn't tell them when I needed it (why else would I pay extra? And I repeatdly told her when I needed it by, which at the very latest was Tuesday). After I said no way, she said it was the initial employee's fault and NOT her fault, so I should get it Friday. She tried telling me that she would ""help me out"" and made it sound like a big deal that the dress would be ready Friday morning and not afternoon. Jeepers! Thanks so much for going out of your way to have my dress ready after I need it, and allowing me the privilege of paying extra! This went around like this for over 5 minutes, until I started crying. I'm not proud that I cried. I was under a great deal of stress (unrelated to the wedding), and not feeling well.

When I tried to explain that I paid extra for it to be ready by a certain day, she got annoyed. (I should note that if they couldn't have done it, I would have appreciated them telling me so, and then I would have gone home, tried to do it myself or worn something else. And then not leave a review.) Finally she said that they could do it, and I could get it Wednesday afternoon. Except I'm getting married at 10am. She then basically said I shouldn't get married on such short notice, and again mentioned this mix-up was my fault. I was in a bit of pain and upset, so I kind of cried a little more and said I really needed it, and then just told her I wanted the dress and to be refunded so I could go. I didn't want it altered. She said she would check to see if they had done anything yet, but if I took the dress (even unaltered) they refused to refund any money. The employee told me that it was too late, they were working on it and to come back around 8pm (they close at 7, so I made sure they would still be there). I told her it wasn't fair that i paid extra for this. Finally the manager came over and begrudgingly said Id be refunded for my surcharge, but that it wasn't their fault, it was my fault. Fine whatever.

I go buzz around for a few hours, and come back... and the'yre closed. No employees that I could see. I called them and someone said that'd let me in and I could have my dress. The manager handed me my cash and my dress. I asked if I should try it on, and she was annoyed, rolled her eyes and said if I really wanted to I could but they were CLOSED. I decided not to because if anything was wrong, what could be done? She didn't give me the full amount back once I counted it at home, and the alterations job wasn't that great. All around miserable experience.",Shopping
m22CbnbNh6tBBtn_5OEjNw,qxuJk8rRr2Fm7OphnzOkoQ,0LU8TLoYmMf6_ujYMPFGJg,2014-10-28,"Upon entering the hidden building, we were greeted by a Korean lady who spoke very little English but was nice nonetheless. We were urged to take off our shoes and place them in separate lockers (I usually share lockers for ease of only having to carry one key but she requested we separate out the shoes so we did - I was with my one friend).  Once you put away your shoes, the hostess exchanges your shoe key for a locker key inside the change room. Payment is $20 cash or $20 + tax if not paying cash. You get a very roomy t-shirt and long shorts - orange for women and blue for men - and 2 small gray towels. The women's change room is to the left and the men's is to the right. 

Inside the (women's) change room there is a showering area where no clothes are permitted (not even swim suits!). The lockers are HUGE so you can potentially bring your entire closet if you need to get ready there before a night on the town. If you do plan on showering there (it's required before you entire the sauna) then I would recommend bringing a larger towel from home to dry yourself off. We also brought our own clean pair of flip flops to wear inside but I saw many people walking around bare footed. 

Once you're all showered and changed you enter the main lobby where there are couches, TVs playing Korean shows, and a small dining area in the middle. If you're hungry there's a variety of food you can get ranging from simple instant noodle cups (there's a pretty decent variety of these), kimbap or chips if you're not too hungry or even full rice and meat plates, not to mention the eggs. I didn't get any but the guy sitting at the table across from me had a plate of what looked like bulgogi, white rice and kim chi (it looked really good, we were eying him pretty hard lol!!!!).  There's also drinks such as aloe or even beer (Sapporo and Canadian) if you want! If you don't want to pay for drinks and you're thirsty, there's a water dispenser on the left of the bar for free in addition to them allowing you to bring in empty water bottles for your personal use. When you get food you only need to show them your locker number and they add the charge to it so you can pay when you leave - you don't need to carry money around.

Now onto the sauna rooms! When you enter there is a large room that's about 25 C that has mats for you to use in the hotter rooms. There are about 9 (I don't remember exactly) including 1 ice room with a big wall of ice. The sauna rooms are made with various crystals and stones that are supposed to have different healing properties. All this information is listed right outside each room for you to peruse. The rooms themselves are quite small, some fit perhaps  4-5 people comfortably. The temperatures range from 32 C all the way to a whopping 92 C (this room has wooden seats). We tried the 32 C, 42 C, and 78 C. My personal favourite was the 42 C as it was hot but not too hot that it was uncomfortable. So I still got sweaty but I wasn't struggling to breathe as I did in the 78 C room.  Since we were all new to the sauna we didn't try the 92 C room but I think I will next time. 

Overall it was a great experience and I will be back again. We were there for about 4 hours but it didn't feel like 4 hours at all! Time just flew. The best thing about this place, besides the saunas (obviously), is that there are tabletop games that you can play (I remember seeing Jenga and Scrabble in their little collection) while you eat or just hang out in the lobby area. If their selection isn't to your liking you can even bring in your own games - I brought in Settlers of Catan to play. 

Lastly, there is in and out privileges. I had left Catan in my car as I wasn't sure if the locker was large enough to fit both my bag and the game so I had to go back out to get it. There was various slippers that you can use to walk outside placed around the front area so you don't have the take your shoes out of the locker. I thought this was a really thoughtful touch!",Beauty
HrHqJbWkyk0p1tmzie9z2Q,vVkPG_5PHqWvnXLI7D78dA,7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg,2017-08-15,"I have had several recommendations to try this place over the years and finally had an opportunity to try it when my husband was up in the area for some family stuff.  While it was not the most ideal way to try a PVBC burger but that was my opportunity.  I had the fries and cheeseburger with all the fixings and honestly felt it was one of the best burgers I have had in a long time, even after a 45 minute car ride.  You can judge all you want, but I don't mind when the burger is a little more on the done side (I am not a fan of blood), so the fact that it sat for a car ride did not bother me.  It was still juicy, a decently thick patty that almost covered the bun and was very tasty - I loved tasting all the different ingredients in every single bite.  Pickled onions in the burger gave it the little zing I normally do not expect and it was completely welcome.  

The FRIES.  Despite being lukewarm, I loved the seasoning on the fries.  My husband was not thinking (he had been at the hospital with a family member for 6 hours so I understand he was zombie-like) and only purchase one order when he should have just gone for two.  I liked the cajun-like spice on the fries with just a hint of sweetness.  I dipped them in ketchup and the jalapeño ranch my husband had picked up for me to dunk my burger in (yes, I am a sauce girl, and yes, I do tend to have several sauces if the variety is there).  Both combinations were great but I was perfectly happy to scarf the fries down just as they were.  I love McDonald's fries (yes, keep judging) and like that they are just slightly crispy and chewy on the outside but the potato is pillowy soft on the inside.  These not only had that consistency (exponentially because of their car ride), they also had yummy seasoning on it as well.  My husband and I had to play rock, paper, scissors for the last few and lucky for me, I won (no, he did not let me win and yes, he did end up stealing a fry which earned him a smack on the hand).  I think between the time he walked in the house to the last fry was about 8, maybe 10 minutes.  Most of my family and friends and even coworkers know how slow I eat.  The fact that I hoovered the burger and fries down leads me to two truths: 1) I was really hungry after a long day at work, and 2) that was a damn good hamburger and side of fries.  

I was disappointed I couldn't try the famed Brûlée burger as I didn't want to risk the yolky goodness drying up.  A few days later we had to be in the area again and I had a golden opportunity to see this place in person.  Our second visit in a week yielded the Brûlée burger for me, two orders of fries (one regular, one sweet potato tots), and a cheeseburger for my husband.  The Brûlée burger was really good - the caramelized sugar on the bun went against every fiber of my being as I do not like mixing flavors, especially sweet and salty in an entree.  However, I felt like it gave the burger such a special flavor profile that I understand why it is there.  Same fixings (love me those pickled onions) and the crowing glory for me, a beautiful over easy egg.  I love over easy eggs, especially when I have something to sop up the yolk (this is graphic, so advert your eyes if you like your eggs completely cooked).  Unfortunately, this burger had a lot of liquid going on, from the patty to the condiments, to the egg.  I ended up giving up after the bun started dissolving a few bites in and kept the food going with a fork and a knife.  It allowed me to make sure every bite had all the main elements (important in my book), and appeased the OCD side of me that does not like having dirty hands.  The fries were even better fresh and I hardly used any sauce with them simply because I loved the seasoning so much.  The sweet potato tots were also really good - so good that my husband, who doesn't normally like them, tried to steal all of them. All in all, a solid first physical visit to PVCC. 

Some things to note: it is definitely small and can get crowded.  When we walked in at 5pm, there was only one table with one chair by the door, leaving us to find two more chairs (for my husband and the baby's carseat).  Ambience was super loud but I think it was mostly due to the large party in the middle of the restaurant and the gaggle of kids next to us who were glued to their phones and trying to best each other in loudness.  Once the kids and supervising parent had gone and the large party finally, mercifully left, the restaurant chilled out.  It was still a little loud as they have music and the TV going, but losing 15 people to the Arizona heat made it a lot more bearable. 

While I plan to come back again in the area, I felt the fries were a pretty small portion for the price.  $3 for about 1\/2 to a 1\/3 cup of fries was kind of depressing. I also wanted to point out that while I loved the softness of the bun, the disintegration while eating was not fun.  The meal was about $30 without drinks so definitely an occasional treat.",Restaurant
9G7b5ML-_UBzUu_tNB_8yQ,6VS9W-1m9ek7vkY4rS-WQQ,OfITr0B8bZU3vukSQJIrWQ,2012-10-21,"Having lived in Arcadia for the majority of my life, I'm always excited to see a new neighborhood spot open up! And, being the Mexican food junkie that I am, Milagro seemed right up my alley.

We decided to check it out on a Sunday night around 7PM and since there were going to be 5 of us, I made a reservation just to play it safe. Considering the fact they had just opened the week prior, this wasn't necessarily a must. We were seated right away and promptly greeted by our friendly server. There were a few other tables of families scattered throughout the fully remodeled Mexican grill but it wasn't crazy busy. It's hard to imagine this being Joey's of Chicago or Rhumbi just a few short months ago.

Being a sucker for a good salsa (I really do feel like that can make or break a Mexican restaurant), we decided to start out with the salsa trio and the fresh, traditional guacamole. The guacamole was amazing and the salsas were nice with a unique touch! Now I tend to like everything really spicy and I didn't find any of the salsas to have too much of a ""kick"" to them, but they were delicious none-the-less.

After perusing the drink menu for some time, I finally decided on the Sandia Diablo (jalapeño-infused Tito's vodka, watermelon purée, cranberry, and pressed lime). This was outstanding! Seeing as how I am quite the vodka-cran aficionado, this sounded like a perfect, Mexican-infused twist on my favorite classic.

For dinner we all opted for different dishes so we could try a variety of menu items. I'm always a taco person so I went with the carne tacos (3 to an order). These were pretty darn good...nicely seasoned with refreshing toppings that complimented the meat well. Now most menu options seemed to be served a la carte, so we ordered a variety of sides to try. Our table had two orders of the basmati rice which I must say was definitely different. It had a very balsamic taste to it (which I didn't mind because I love vinegar), however, it is not your traditional rice. We also tried the frijoles blancos and frijoles rancheros which were both delicious!

Now this isn't going to be your traditional Mexican restaurant. If you are looking for cheese crisps and enchiladas, you'd be better off going next door to Tee Pee. However, at Tee Pee you can expect to find twice the grease and half the quality. Milagro is going to be a little on the pricier side but hey, if the food is good it doesn't bother me. One thing I will say is that I wouldn't mind seeing some fajitas or enchiladas on their menu in the future!

If you haven't yet driven past Milagro, one of their main draws is the huge expansion of the patio. With the weather cooling down, this will be a huge key to their success! I look forward to chips and salsa filled Happy Hours spent relaxing on the patio with a Sandia Diablo in hand.

Overall it was good food, good drinks, good atmosphere, and I am definitely excited to have another restaurant option nearby!",Restaurant
fUcsxpohIjxASst3RWeffA,btw7MwfVyrBFTu9VizBOlw,bgvm73MMjC2f5qo_RgXOXg,2011-07-03,"I was on my way to Good Food at Montford when I got mugged at gunpoint in the parking garage of my hotel. That night, I ate a sad (albeit comped) meal of overcooked steak Diane and chugged several glasses of Sutter Home in my hotel room.

The next night, I was determined to take back my life -- starting with my taste buds. I dined on the earlier side, hoping to avoid crowds and grab a seat without a reservation. Not only did I get a seat, but I was able to saddle up at the chef's bar where I could watch Executive Chef Marc Jacksina prepare my dishes (amazing that in NC, executive chefs are actually working the night chef, touching and cooking food). Given that small dining room, decked out in wood-carved everything from tables and chairs to chandeliers -- I believed that I had taken one of the better seats in the house. 

My server was a little frazzled -- perhaps, a little clueless -- as he had a difficult time answering simple questions about several menu and wine items, but he was polite about everything and I wasn't about to pick a fight. I was there to be gastronomically cleansed. 

I ordered a California syrah thinking that I'd order myself some pork-liciousness. But I changed course as I watched Chef Marc work. Knowing the pride Halcyon took in sourcing fresh ingredients locally, I decided that I would focus solely on vegetarian dishes -- a huge departure from my largely carnivorous diet. And I didn't want to do the typical -- no wedge salad or cheese plate. I remember a retired Marine who came into my wine store after serving his last tour of duty and upon my asking what he was looking for, replied, ""something memorable."" In no way do I wish to compare my trials and tribulations with those of our armed service men and women, but I was looking for something akin to the bottle of Les Forts de Latour that I sent him home with.

I opted for a ""beet carpaccio"" and a ricotta gnudi over spaghetti sqaush.

The thinly-sliced beets were sprinkled with sugar and torched -- just enough so the top crusted over like a creme brulee. This was accompanied by a caponota of pureed turnip, shaved apples, carrot puree and spots of aged balsamic. Absolutely delicious -- an epiphany, really -- each ingredient sold itself individually, but blended together harmoniously -- a celebration of seasonal flavors, textures, colors and temperatures. 

Then came the warm bowl that contained my gnudi and squash - like a delicate eggs nestled in a fragile bird's nest. With just the right amount of brown, sage butter and dash of nutmeg, this dish put me over the edge. The squash was just right - not a yellow, tasteless mush -- but with just a slight bite the way one would prefer their pasta al dente. The gnudi was fluffy, not heavy -- seared just right so it wasn't greasy, showcasing the skill of a strong kitchen staff. 

This meal was incredibly meaningful, coming on the heels of such a terrible experience. I was incredibly appreciative that it didn't disappoint. In fact, it was inspiring to watch Chef Marc and company coax such complexity from simplicity. Quite a triumphant return for my traumatized palate.",Restaurant

My boyfriend and I had bought each other a Couple's Retreat package called ""Exotic Escape"". It consisted of Water Therapies which was an overcrowded pool area with 2 small pitch dark steam rooms (which I couldn't even see where I was going), only to discover that someone was in there with me when I thought I was alone. The whirlpool was small and overcrowded and didn't have the 'couples'  feel. We had expected something slightly larger. The pool was nice. No complaints there.  We were also given a nice warm cozy robe with flip flops and unlimited fresh clean towel usage. Which was nice. No complaints there either. There were also fully operational showers, change rooms, and change areas and lockers. You were also supplied with the necessary toiletries to get showered and ready. Anything else you were required to bring yourself. Which is expected, and that's fine.

The package also included a 50-minute couple's Swedish massage. We were lead onto the 4th floor and welcomed into a nice relaxing environment. We didn't have to wait long for our massage therapists to come and greet us. They were very friendly and welcoming.  The room we were led into was very nice. The ambiance was endearing, and consisted of 2 massage tables dressed nicely with matching sheets. The room even had a fireplace! My boyfriend and I both agree that the massages were great, but its no different anywhere else you go.

When my boyfriend and I checked out we were given our 'complimentary' take-home spa products, which quite frankly, could be bought at Winners in the section where no-name stuff could be bought for $3. However the staff were all very friendly and made sure they asked if we felt relaxed and enjoyed our first spa experience.

The final touch to the package once we were finished in the spa was dinner at The Bangkok Garden right next door. The Elmwood Spa and Bangkok Garden are affiliated with each other so, this must be how they incorporate the dinner within the spa package we chose.

 The restaurant was very dim and dark, although the decor was quite cute. I've seen better. But I still honestly liked the decor. 

Now for the disappointing part: The food. The menu we received was a set menu. The items on the menu sounded appealing enough, so we picked our choices and then we waited........and waited.....and waited. Our waiter was very slow, and considering he was only waiting 3 tables each with 2 people per table, we expected faster service. But thats not the full reason. THE SERVING SIZES WERE SOOO SMALL! I ordered the Thai spring rolls as an appetizer, and only 3 came on a plate, with WATERY plum sauce and shaved carrots. Their website menu makes it sound like its so much better than what we actually ate! My appetizer, a 'beef salad' although tasty, was also small, but lacked substance in the sense that my 'beef salad' had no actual 'salad' in it. Again, just shavings of carrot, and meaningless sprigs of mint, and scraps of other nameless leaves.  My boyfriend and I ordered the same main dish: Chicken Pattaya. Chicken patayyNOTHIN! It was 2 small grilled chicken breasts lightly seasoned and cut into strips, with (again) WATERY Thai chilli sauce which only exaccerbated the BURN in the roof of my mouth from the piping hot Thai Spring rolls. I understand the need for food to be HOT when served, but to be too hot to eat when you are HUNGRY? Not too pleased.

Our desert, was ok. I ate it, but my boyfriend didn't. We both ordered the Deep Fried Banana with icecream and 'fruit'. (which consisted of one SLIVER of strawberry, & half of an orange slice!) I figured I would eat it because truthfully, it tasted better than anything else on the menu.

NOW FOR THE PART THAT GAVE US THE HEART ATTACK! : THE BILL! 

Our voucher was handed in at the beginning of our meal, and was used to put towards our bill at the end of our meal. When we recieved our bill we were SHOCKED to discover, that the bill WOULD HAVE BEEN ***$112 DOLLARS*** had we actually PAID for this meal! WTF! We had to put $11.32  because of my wine spritzer & my boyfriends Coke towards the meal which was TRUTHFULLY all the entire meal was worth anyway! We were practically handed a Winterlicious menu & paid $112 for it.

My boyfriend and I are of the opinion that the whole entire package is priced backwards! We both feel that for the price we paid for our spa package (which was $303 + taxes & gratuities), we should have gotten MORE out of the spa services (such as a mani\/pedi or a facial or something) rather than the dinner which was worth the price of a Swiss Chalet meal for 2 &  that's being generous!

So basically the breakdown of the $303 was as follows:

Water Therapies: complimentary
50-min Couples Swedish massage: estimating at $191 for both of us together
Dinner at Bangkok Gardens: $112

Both of us were very happy that almost all of the details were taken care of and that the work we had to do planning was very minimal. I called the Chapel April 6th right before closing time and even though the wedding was coming up really quick they made the whole process easy and stress free. 

For our main package we chose the Garden and Gazebo package because we really wanted to get married in the garden (too bad it was cold that day lol).  Then for add ons we did the smallest package so that we could get some on site photos after our ceremony. I honestly wasn't expecting my photos to come out like they did (I've seen photos from other chapels that were just terrible compared to the ones on the site) but our photographer Alyssa did a really, really good job. I just posted the photos up online an hour ago and I have already received so many compliments on them plus the ladies in the photo studio were really great to work with when it came to choosing our print package even though we came in a few hours earlier than our appointment (thanks again)!


I gave the chapel four stars because prior to my ceremony on my photo and video release I stated that I did not want my video posted on the website to prevent certain family members from seeing it. Sunday we found out that it had been posted and those people we didn't want to see it has easily found it through Google. The chapel is closed Sundays so I left a message for them, it was taken down the next morning but I was still upset that these people saw the video and when I told them I was not happy about it I was pretty much told ""Oh well we took it down, we can't control what people search on Google"".... well if the video link was never posted they wouldn't have had anything to search for or find. It didn't seem like anyone was even willing to apologize for the mistake and made me feel like now that they had our money they didn't care. I know the wedding business is a big sales machine but customer service is important in sales too so I think some of the employees could take a CSR 101 class before getting on the phones with customers who have questions, comments, concerns and even complaints.

Also with my husband being in the military we had said from the first phone call that we needed to get our certified marriage certificate ASAP so we were told we could have it expedited. Fast forward to yesterday, I called the Chapel to see if we would be able to get our certificate today. The girl I spoke with was kind of rude to me for not understanding the process in Vegas ... this was my first time getting married and I'm sorry but the Clark County website  doesn't fully explain the expedite process! Anyways it turns out we didn't pay to have it expedited since we weren't ever told to but in the end it all worked out because Al was very quick about filing our license and after going to the Recorders office in person we were able to walk out 
with copies today. 

Only other complaint is during our ceremony a vehicle backing up had the  vehicle in reverse sound blarring so unfortunately you can hear it in our video BUT it adds some humor to the whole thing since it looks like we're in a beautiful garden setting when really we were in a beautiful garden setup on a small lot right on the chapels driveway. The grounds are very pretty, smaller than I imagined but I personally think this chapel is one of the most beautiful ones in Vegas and it was well worth every penny.

Thank you to everyone who helped make my special day special!",Shopping

I was very excited to try Kaka AYCE as I am a huge fan of Japanese food and I'm always up for trying the latest and greatest. After seeing the mouth watering photos from my friends, I knew I had to book a reservation 3 weeks early. Getting someone to pick up the phone on the reservation phone line is a mission. I had to try several times over several days before being lucky enough to speak to a human being.

When I arrived, I found that booking my reservation 3 weeks prior may have been a result of unnecessary hype. The place wasn't as busy as I heard, with several empty tables. 

Our party of 5 was squished into a small table of 4. It was very disappointing especially when I saw very nice circular table by the window that was empty the entire time.  That table wasn't even filled until 30 minutes later by another party of 5 which upset me a little bit.

In terms of the service, if this is the ""new and improved"" I would be scared to see what it was like before. The servers are essentially mechanical robots whose main duty is to fetch food, serve them to you, and take away dirty plates in the precision you would see in a manufacturing plant. There is little to no interaction. It is very challenging to get service for basic things like water\/tea refills and extra napkins. 

The weekend special is even more mind boggling. There is no explanation provided to you, they automatically place the order for you and serve it to you. My parents do not eat beef and one of the dishes is a blow torched beef sushi. It would have been nice if the server had explained the weekend special and taken our order instead of just serving it to you.

In terms of food, I would say this is where I was disappointed. There is generally a lack of variety of items especially in the Appetizers and Sashimi section of the menu. With the premium pricing they charge, at places like Shogun and Spoon & Fork would offer premium offerings such as Squid Sashimi, Sweet Shrimp, Octopus Sashimi. None of these items are found aside from the basic: Salmon, Tuna, Red Snapper, and Surf Clam. I would estimate the menu has about 70 items while other AYCE would typically offer 100+ items. I will also mention the plate used for the sashimi looks very cheap and doesn't match the sophisticated decor of the restaurant.

The blow torched sushi is their staple. While it was good, it lacks smokey flavour you would get from real blow torched sushi. Realistically, this is not an item you would consume a lot since it fills you fast with all the rice. I would prefer to have more variety of sashimi which I value at an AYCE Sushi\/Sashimi restaurant. 

The cooked items were extremely disappointing. The miso soup is very sweet in flavour. The ""lobster"" bisque was medium temperature, I like my soups to be hot. My stir fried seafood udon came with a pile of liquid that tasted like ketchup. I wish I took a photo for you, but it was so disappointing I did not bother. There was even chicken in my ""seafood"" udon. I also ordered a Veggie Udon in broth, the broth tasted sweet and the ""veggie"" udon contained imitation crab meat. Imitation crab meat is typically made out of white fish, so it is ridiculous that an offering of ""veggie"" udon actually contains meat.

All the skewers were very disappointing. They tried very hard to replicate the Yakitori restaurants downtown, but none of the food items had any flavour. The pork belly had no caremlization or searing to it. It tasted very strong of pork flavour. The other grill items looked steamed like the eggplant which is a stable dish or the grilled saury had a pool of water at the bottom. The grilled Okra they drizzled some brown sauce on top that took away from otherwise a good dish. The best cooked dish was actually the baked oyster which I recommend. The quail which is a unique item for AYCE was poorly executed with the spices they used

In terms of ordering, several of our items were missing. We were also given wrong items a lot of times. So the iPad system while fancy, is still subject to human error. The owner\/manager would observe the area during the dining experience. He was rushing us near the end that the 9pm reservations have showed up, yet the problem was our desserts were incomplete and missing. He said he would go in the back to get our desserts personally, yet our 4 orders of Hokkaido Brulee never arrived. Being fed up, we got the bill and left without getting our desserts and the failed promise of the owner\/manager.

This restaurant is worth checking out at least once, would I go back again? Probably in another year to see if they got their stuff together and if they've improved. Servers or more accurately described as food delivery personnel could use more customer service training. The focus on delivering food takes away from any human interaction. The owner\/manager seems very unapproachable as well, often standing in the dining room looking like a drill sergeant of a US Navy Platoon.",Restaurant
9CNJH4DnFa-gqvsS_Ez-6A,BA9SDRZGyRcUMxTdUTVhmw,e2SP1ZLQI45948rv_sNIUg,2013-07-13,"I tell ya, I've eaten here twice and will go back, but it's been interesting each time.  Most of the ""interesting"" vibe centers around the servers.  

The first time, Mr. M and I both had regular bacon and egg breakfasts with an added order of B & G.  The place is named Biscuits for God's sake, so we must try the B.  

The bacon is spectacular.  It was cooked perfectly and tasted and smelled how a BBQ smokehouse does.  Loved that.  Everything else was fine, except for the B & G.  It must have been an exception, because other reviewers have raved about it, but ours had 2 hard, dry biscuits.  No amount of gravy is going to soften those up in the 2 minutes it's at our table.  And speaking of the gravy, I could taste an overwhelming floury, pasty flavor and texture to the gravy.  My guess is someone was over-baked themselves that morning and made a thin batch of gravy and then went overboard with the flour or cornstarch or roux or whatever they use to thicken it.   I'm chalking that up as a fluke and will try those again.  

Our server on the first visit was just straight up weird.  She acted like she didn't want to get too close to the table and would stand behind my left shoulder to talk to us, then would hustle away after we gave our orders.  Very strange.  

The second time was a great visit overall, other than our server, Richard.  We were the only table seated outside at that time and it was a lovely sunny morning just before the heat ratcheted up.   When Richard greeted us he was very friendly and all smiles.  He took our order and that's the last we saw of him until it was check time.  

They give you very teeny water glasses and those were empty in no time.  I also had a café mocha and that was very tasty and pretty as well.  I would definitely have that again.  The lack of water refills was annoying, but if I get annoyed enough I'll get up and go ask for more.   

The avocado benedict was absolutely perfect.  The English muffin was toasted and then the eggs were cooked about medium.  Runny yolk, but not watery.  And the avocado was fresh, creamy deliciousness.   Fresh tomatoes as well that tasted like they were from the garden.  That meal was so good I'm going to have a hard time trying something else when I go back.  

Mr. M got a regular bacon and egg breakfast but added a pancake so we could give that a try.  Everything he ordered was delicious as well.  We were eating kind of slowly for a change and just enjoying the morning and the weather when a busboy came on out and didn't say a word, but reached over us to attempt to grab the plate with a half-eaten pancake. 

Oh no.  Oh no.  You do not want to risk losing a digit by doing that.  I was kind of shocked he didn't say a word, and I politely informed him we weren't finished yet.  I asked for more water, but never got it.

Ten minutes later here comes long-lost Richard, all smiles, presenting us with the check and thanking us profusely for coming in....laying it on pretty thick.

Richard, do you think I was born yesterday?  Your performance today earned you about a 12% tip, maybe less if I wasn't in such a good mood.  Servers should always come back and check about 2 minutes after the food has been dropped, and then about 10-15 minutes later and have their eyes open for drink refills.  At a minimum.

UBLQ3g1Fu68-G7jeiZaJlQ,nPQ1eo_wWfj1elBf_0Fd8Q,t7E0chL0rY4NNKtkHs7kaQ,2015-04-01,"We got married at the Echo Lake Inn, in Ludlow, Vermont, Memorial Day weekend-May 24, 2014 after being together for 7 years and long distance for the last 3 of those years.  My husband, Chris, and I discussed the aspects regarding an engagement ring (what it means to us and the history behind it, what our families have done previously, and qualities we both would like to see in a prospective stone and setting). After watching Blood Diamond in years prior we were both quite turned off by the idea of purchasing any ring (we considered melting down family jewelry on both sides, but then we also felt that the ring should be a new gift from Chris to me, since the meaning would be formed in the commitment we would be extending to one another and that memories and experiences would be had upon wearing this new piece that would be specific to us as couple and our journey and love story together, both good days and bad over the years).  However, we ended up going with a recycled white gold 18k engagement ring with a conflict-free center stone from Brilliant Earth (see my review for Brilliant Earth for further information).  And then the wedding planning journey was kicked off officially for our proposal in 2012!

Deciding on a wedding band was one of the few wedding planning items that I waited on and was indecisive regarding for most of the wedding planning process and details.  In my spare time I would search and search with magazines, google, various wedding websites and apps, jewelry stores and chains, talking to family and friends and observing other ideas for wedding bands, and I still couldn't quite get set on what I wanted or had a vision of until about 3 months before our wedding. 

I wanted something that wasn't part of a set so I had the option to wear the band by itself.  And I knew I wanted 18k white gold (so as to match my engagement ring which was of the same metal), with etchings on the sides, but no stones (so that it would be easier to clean and for general use and also so that if I wanted to engrave the inside of it, like all my maternal ancestors' wedding bands that I have from my side of the family, I could).  I went in person to Roman Jewelers (a local chain out by my parents in central Jersey) multiple times and looked through their book, describing what I was looking for, but they didn't really have it.  And then Chris and I went to a Jared out by his family in Long Island in New York and they too, recommended we look within their expanded book for offerings and kept suggesting men's bands to me.  

My cousin recommended Art Carved, Blue Nile, and Antique Jewelry Mall since she said a few of her older friends had rings similar to what I described and that these kinds of carved wedding bands with milgrain edges were popular about 5-10 years before we got married.  We ended up going with a gorgeous design from the Marlene Harris collection in Pittsburgh, PA-WBRK100A.  http:\/\/www.marleneharriscol.com\/item\/WBRK100A
I had to keep scouring the Internet, Pinterest, and Etsy for antique style bands.  (FYI I also really liked WB1588-22W as well as SD1273).  

I am very happy with my band and how it looks with or without the engagement ring from Brilliant Earth paired with it, even during different temperature or weather changes throughout the year.  The only factor is that on the off chance or occasion I've accidentally bumped my finger while wearing the band against something or when I've been carrying a bag with that hand and the handles have rubbed against the ring, I neurotically check to make sure it's okay.  I also am paranoid that it would rub off some of the side stones on the edge of my engagement ring on the days I wear the two rings together, but this also has not happened.  I've gotten a lot of complements about the stippled swirl designs on the edges from even casual acquaintances and other persons.  And Marlene Harris got the ring out to us really fast and in the correct sizing and everything-considering Chris placed the order only 3 weeks prior to our wedding (I was really panicking, since I hadn't found anything I was satisfied with until super close to the wedding) it all came together great.",Shopping

I was really pissed when Jillian's closed. It was one of the few venues that featured local bands and appealed to the under 21 crowd. That's a rarity in the valley, the biggest advancement of all ages shows on the strip was in the earliest incarnation of Gameworks, when it had the climbing structure in the coke bottle. 

Would Jillian's replacement be worthy? I went in with a big open mind, which is necessary here.

First thing you notice outside is, how do I put it nicely? Well, they didn't. It's not a truck scale. It's to weigh those that challenge it's 350 lb. mark. If you're heavier than that, you get to eat for free, the details of which I'm not sure of. I'm guessing it's not for a side salad.

Since I didn't have much time, I decided to go in for a PBR and because I was reluctant to binge in a place that encouraged it on this level. 

A new place has a ""lot to take in"" factor when you enter, must be a board of tourism rule more than a one of fine dining. Before you can visually climatize a couple of hostesses (let's face it, there's no hosts in a breastaurant) put a cloth gown on you. You realize everyone is dressed this way. Is that their form of a bib? 

They put a strap on your wrist, get it it's like a hospital patients'?! There are Vegas restaurants that want you to advertise to other tourists where you've been. Where did they get that big white paper hat? We have to eat there!(?) Where'd they get that guitar you can drink from? Let's go there!

They hand you a menu, that lets you know you can buy it on the cover. I sat at the bar because I love bar service for several reasons. At this bar, there's a ""doctor"" bartender. I could focus on the carnival that unfolds in this place. 

There's a lucky strike cigarette machine (unfiltered). There are servers dressed in tight cleavage nurse outfits. If you're eating here, chances are you've heard about the people who have actually died that have had some connection to the place. While other businesses would shun this, this place advertises it. A local has their ashes on the bar and I heard the bartender tell his story 4 times the time I was there. For 1 beer.

With a wooden paddle, nurses actually spank guys that don't finish their burgers, so you better not have to pee or crap if you can't finish. See how funny it is that a cute nurse gets to spank a guy while you eat dinner? 

They offer 4 burgers for their menu, the difference being the number of patties. They took a cue from the success of In-n-out burger's minimal menu. But at least HAG offers pickles, bacon and mustard. 

On the walls there are  a lot of collages of images, 3 kinds: 1) towards the bathroom, there are all kinds of classic pieces of art with a HAG modification of it, maybe to appeal to ""higher class,"" patrons? 2) on the far back wall are pop movie posters, each has a HAG modification, to appeal to 20-30 somethings, get it? 3) a mural on the far wall of the last supper, and the participants are fast food mascots eating with a doctor from HAG, to appeal to kids, get it? 

It's a big lesson in ad marketing, mix your brand with successful, well known symbols as if to be endorsed by them, using them under the copyright loophole of spoofing. Star Max Wars, get it? With Luke Maxwalker. 

This place seems to cater to the bachelor\/ette crowds, as well as the people that give the guy they know that coughs with their smoking problem a pack of cigarettes. It's based on peer dares, weather or not you can ""handle it.""

Yeah, I got the jokes. And in Vegas, I certainly have handled many challenges of unsafe drinking, drugs and sexual uh... This place is crawling with gimmickry and I just felt like I was in front of planet hollywood, with all the ads yelling at me with flashy lights and people sticking fliers in my face.

This place is like tabloid tv, it may be fun to check out and ""laugh at,"" but I wouldn't want to be a regular part of it until I became it.",Restaurant
ZBhJrPII6YujaNooVIdlng,lucIbk6WeQ6Nq0Zr5jrSBA,pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,2011-01-19,"Steak here is quite bomb-good! It's a Michael Mina restaurant, so his signature style is interpreting an ingredient in 3 different preparations and flavors. So I was excited when this came out first while we decide on drinks.

TRIO OF DUCK FAT FRIES (comp amuse) - 5 stars
1. Smoked paprika and mustard fries w\/a smoked paprika and mustard crème fraîche dip 
2. Truffle fries with a truffle aïoli dip
3. Rosemary and onion fries with an onion ketchup dip

I love french fries and these were cooked right. Fresh potatoes were cut and fried to perfection. The exterior was crispy and the inside was soft with a richer taste coz of the duck fat.

Our table didn't get the 2nd complimentary dish, the olive oil focaccia. I should have asked, but I wanted to save room for steak.

STRIP-PEAR ($13) - 4 stars
I chose the Strip-Pear martini. It's made with Grey Goose La Poire (Anjou pear flavored vodka), lychee puree (instead of the usual pear puree) and fresh lime juice. Pear was the main flavor with a hint of lychee. It was sweet and medium strong... nice.

Other drinks we got were: Guinness ($8), Stella Artois ($8), New Castle ($7) and Lustau Solera ($13).

18oz DRY-AGED BONE-IN RIB EYE ($51) - 4 stars
10oz FILET MIGNON ($54) - 4.5 stars
All of our steaks came out medium\/high warm. Note, after grilling steaks need to rest for the juices redistribute. Both steaks were super tasty and tender with a smokey and peppery finish. All 4 (1 rib eye and 3 filets) steaks were cooked perfectly as requested. 

The plate presentation is simple: steak, a whole roasted shallot and yellow pepper and garnished with a small sprig of thyme. No fluffy presentation for the main dish. There's room on the plate to place your sides.  It's a steakhouse after all.

I asked out server how the steaks are cooked and she said, ""They're poached then grilled and basted with a wine butter."" I did some research to get the details of how they cook their steaks.

Step 1: Steaks are placed in slow-poaching chambers, which enhances flavor and tenderness. The meat heats for several hours at a low temperature. 

Step 2: Steaks are then grilled on a cast iron grill above mesquite wood. The wood gives every cut of steak a nice subtle smokiness.

POTATO PUREE TRIO ($14)  - 4 stars
Another trio dish we ordered. The 3 flavors were: horseradish, lobster and sour cream. The puree was seasoned nicely. All of the purees were smooth, rich and creamy. 

BACON-CREAMED SPINACH ($10) - 4 stars
The crowd fav was the creamed spinach. It was made with spinach, heavy cream, shallot, garlic, butter, nutmeg, S&P and topped with bacon crumbs.

PASSION FRUIT PANNA COTTA ($12) - 4 stars
Passion fruit pieces, red grape fruit, thin slices of avocado, and coconut sorbet sit atop the panna cotta. The panna cotta itselft was refreshing, light and subtle sweet. The avocado gave the dessert extra creaminess and weight. While the grapefruit and coconut sorbet gave it a tart and sweet pairing.

MILK CHOCOLATE CUSTARD ($12) - 3.5 stars
Small red velvet cake pieces, powder sugar, toasted pecans, cocoa nib ice cream lay on top of the chocolate custard. This dessert was smooth and rich like a very thick pudding. The topping provided a nice contrast.

I was so full by the end of dinner. Anyhow, the steak dinner was a nice way to close out our weekend of Vegas fun. Cost for a party of 4 with tax was $335 (alcohol $49, steaks $213, sides $24 and dessert $24). 

Reduce costs by 1) get alkie during happy hour 4-7pm at the bar, 2) non-big eaters share a steak or 3) order the prix fixe menu 3-courses for $55. Prix fixe only offers chicken or prime rib.

But the partners have expanded the floor plan of their site to push to the street entrance which opens to a casual bar with the dining area in the back.

As I have mentioned in previous reviews, I have some strict preferences after living in Italy for many years. But regardless of whether you know the specialties or not, one can determine quality at any level.

Here are some quick impressions of Matteo's.

Still in the developmental stage on the floor as of this date though they have been open about a month as of 4\/24\/2015. The hostess, while not aloof, was not the energetic, charismatic individual I would have in place to welcome diners and make them feel this was a unique location and experience. She perfunctorily ushered us to a table and said our server, Anthony, would be along.

Anthony demonstrated a lot more energy, but lacked a great deal of finesse. He did not seem to readily know the menu, but I was willing to accept that with a recent opening. Still, with a lot riding on an open, I would have expected management to better recruit and train. Have to take a few points for not being a bit more gracious in his approach.

The tables themselves sported fresh linen with a paper liner. The diner ware had great lines and balance.

We were served warm crusty bread and a dipping sauce while the first course was being gathered. Good bread with a nice crust. The dipping sauce had the consistency and taste of an Italian dressing with a few bits of peppers and tomatoes . Nice, but I probably would have seen the same thing on my salad if I had selected the Italian dressing. Some good olive oil flavored with garlic and rosemary would be a better choice.

The co owner, Dave, returned with our first courses. A wedding soup for my friend and I took the house salad. The soup was hearty and well flavored. The salad was acceptable with a minimum of tomatoes,some good field greens and red onion. Could have skipped the packaged pepperoni and thrown in some good olives or pepperacini for my tastes.

Anthony was back with our wine selections. But service technique was lacking as he attempted to hand me the wine awkwardly across the table. Serve from the right, my man.

Adequate selection of wines by the glass though an addition of a Lambrusco would have been welcome for those who don't appreciate dry wines. (American tastes lean toward much sweeter wines.)

Main course arrived with gnocchi for my companion while I took the Italian mac and cheese with a side of meatballs and sausage.

With all the other slights overlooked, I will admit the meatballs and sausage were spot on. Moist ball of veal, beef and pork with just the right seasoning. Sausage was also excellent with a distinctive flavor of fennel. Again, would have been great to get the backstory to better promote the restaurant from Anthony when we ordered on the preparation, but perhaps that will come in time as the staff truly gets on board with product knowledge.

My dish was capivati with a mix of cheeses and a type of bacon that I would hope was panchetta. Nicely done though I would have liked a bit more cheese (it was not goopy or overcooked as most recipes I find seem to be) and perhaps a presentation that indicated that it was 'al forno' - baked. Though I was told later it was, just didn't appear so.  (the picture posted in the strip above is what it should look like....not was served to me unfortunately).  

We capped things off with their version of a tiramisu that Anthony had included in a list of desserts he had some difficulty in describing fully. He did know that this tiramisu was more cake like than the traditonal and took extra effort to describe the 'discoloration' in the layers as the expresso flavoring. Perhaps not the most apt word to use, but we figured it out. It actually appeared more similar to an Italian cream cake, topped with fresh whipped cream and a strawberry glaze. Good portion for the money but not really tiramisu to me.

Bit of uncertainty with the bill which listed an item at the wrong price, but Dave was quick to handle it. (Still goes to show that it doesn't hurt to check the bill before paying)

Overall, a good experience with the bill coming in around $60. I am intrigued to try some of the other offerings and would return at some time in the future. The tables were filling up closer to 6 p.m. so diners are also interested in their fare. Good food, but I would suggest a heartier helping of 'Allegria' or 'joy or happiness' as the Italians say from the staff next time. "" Read less",Restaurant
F5egioiPuc4hH-znjelFCw,2NIY78Cdkgk7KfeG8LoLDA,Az_60nNuh1FH8Ds8oasZjw,2010-07-19,"We recently stayed at the Encore for 3 nights as a part of a packaged deal which included a 3 night stay, 2 tickets to La Reve, and a $25 dollar slot machine credit (which I promptly lost in about 20 minutes).  

Overall, the hotel was very nice.  The lobby and casino decor is very gaudy, as is the Wynn, but since that's what they're going for, I won't hold it against them.  The hotel rooms and hallways were lovely.  Our room was beautiful and comfortable, although the view of down town Las Vegas left a bit to be desired.  Don't listen to those warnings from the front desk about noise from the club.  Get the view of the strip and wear some earplugs.

The pools were fantastic.  Very beautiful and plenty of chairs to be had.  If it hadn't been so hot we would have stayed out there longer and rented a cabana, of which there are tons.  The casino itself was nice, and smelled good, which is an accomplishment, but not much different than the other hotels in this class.

Although the hotel was nice, our customer service experience was a bit disappointing.  When we checked in, we were offered a selection of about 5 available rooms.  When we chose one on the 34th floor, we got our keys and headed up.  Upon arriving, we noticed a $20 bill and some change sitting on the desk, and then an open bottle of lotion on a table, and when I looked in the bathroom and saw multiple personal belongings on the counter, it was confirmed - the Encore front desk had checked us into someone else's room!  Thank goodness those poor people weren't IN the room when we opened it up.  And thankfully we are honest people and didn't steal their belongings!  

We immediately grabbed our things and left to tell the front desk that they had checked us into an already occupied room.  The woman at the front desk acted flustered and irritated (not really apologetic though) and offered us an upgrade to a panoramic suit (over the regular suit we had booked).  It was basically the same exact room on a higher floor, which afforded me a better view of the Riviera.  Great. 

We also inquired about using the gym.  Your choices are 15 bucks a day per person, or pay the resort fee for all nights you are staying, which was $67 dollars in our case.  No, thanks, that's TWICE what I pay for my monthly gym membership!  Considering how expensive this hotel is, you would think the guests at the Encore would be allowed to have full use of the facilities offered without paying extra.

I also agree with some other reviewers that the food options at this hotel are a let down.  $3.50 for a small black coffee and 4 bucks for a croissant is not the best way to start your day.  We wound up walking across the street to Fashion Show mall for several meals for better dining options at better prices.  I suppose I can include close proximity to the mall as a plus.

As a side note, La Reve was completely amazing, and whether or not you stay at the Encore, it is definitely worth seeing!! 

Overall, the hotel was nice, and as long as you don't mind spending a lot on your trip, you will have a great stay.  Well, if they don't let strangers into your room, that is!",Shopping

4 1\/2, STARS

Found a Groupon for $60 a night and met up  with a friend who was in town for a convention at the end of the week.  

What a beautiful resort. Located at the very north end of Vegas about a half hour drive to downtown Fremont and 30-45 minutes to the strip.  It is a great getaway resort if you are looking to enjoy the casino and desert but not be inundated with all the crazy nightlife of the Strip and downtown!

The rooms are beautiful. Beds are very comfortable! We had two queens and plenty of room to walk about. There was a GIANT deep tub in the bathroom along with nice amenities, including a high powered hairdryer. Our view was ok..mostly of the roof, but if you looked beyond, the amazing painted desert landscape and mountains were phenomenal.  Next time I'd probably request a better room with a view of the pool to watch sunset. Our friends had a king room but only had a shower. However their view from the 6th floor was much better. So if a bathtub is a must, be sure to request.

No coffee maker and although there was a mini fridge, it was not plugged in nor set well in the dresser.  Also no microwave. However they did offer free coffee, tea and daily newspaper downstairs until noon. 

Maid service came everyday and was very thorough. We saw them steam cleaning hall carpets and vacuuming. The place smelled nice and smoking in the hotel (at least on our floor and room) was prohibited, which was awesome for me, the non smoker! 

We were always greeted with smiles by all the staff!  Everyone was so friendly and you can tell they liked their jobs. 

The pool is beautiful. Ranging up to 4 ft deep. Heated and salt water!  There is always a lifeguard on duty when open and security when pool closes.  I wish hours were later. Pool and hot tub close at 6 (at least when we visited). But the lounge area remained opened after pool hours and is very comfortable and relaxing, decorated with dark wood times and thick burnt orange cushions.  Cabanas are available for an additional fee (again, it was empty and not needed when we visited). But are very nice.  There is a poolside bar where you can order drinks and food. And a public restroom in close vicinity to pool. 

The casino has everything from penny poker, keno, slots, black jack and up with a designated high roller area. (I did not visit) a non smoking bingo hall. Plus all the card and dice games.

Cocktail service was often. The staff again was friendly.  One lady, uggh I'm drawing a blank, something with a B, came around and set us up with players cards around 1 in the morning while we were playing penny video poker (really a dollar with max bet, but hey I was winning, thus not counting!) She was GREAT! Walked us through the process step by step. 

Also they have a variety of quick bite eateries,a TGI FRIDAY'S, fine dining and a buffet.  Loved my Philly cheese steak at Johnny Rockets. Chili cheese kraut dig was ok at Nathan's. Service was exceptional at buffet but food was less than desirable. And it's never eat at TGI FRIDAY'S again.

And if all that is not enough, they have a Spa and gym which we did not use, but looked beautiful.

And the movie theater (Regal) was ok. We saw Beauty and the Beast.  They had problems with sound for the first 5 minutes. Thankfully it was fixed. You can't bring outside food or drink in (even if night two minutes before in the casino). Which irks me...But oh well.

So in a nutshell, this place has so much to offer! Close to Red Rock Nature Preserve. We were not successful getting an Uber the one night we needed it..so don't count on that. But if you have a car or just are looking for a great relaxing time away... this place is a great pick!  I know there are many great options in Vegas, and this one is definitely on the list!

Additional shout out to LATIQUE  from the Salted Lime who was our bartender two nights while gambling at the bar.  She's an asset to the company, the property, the casino and I'm giving her the well deserved praise she earned for her awesomeness as both an employee and a human being!  Happy..energetic..friendly.. positive.... just can't say enough great things about her!  Plus she's just a great bartender!  Kudos to management for finding such a diamond!  Don't loose her!",Beauty
k9M5AYC9TqQv9c_vIO6b4g,wCIhZAalBRqYotGbkWSKCQ,yj8lfLr9fn9g_0nqHluLRQ,2017-05-09,"This place is a mini mall not a gym. Let's start with the positive, the gym has incredible amenities and the local staff is helpful and polite.
    This is the ugliest gym I have ever been in. It is obvious that the problem with the facilities stem from an outdated corporate model. This place is basically a McDonalds chain. What inspires you? Is it beige? Is it brown? Well you are in luck, the showers are cheap beige tile on the floor, the walls and the ceiling. Then for some reason they have a slate wall and a sliver of shiny granite you would expect from a 1997 office building. It is as if they went to Home Depot, asked: what is on sale? and said we will take it, all of it. Are these scratchy towels on sale? Great the guests want to scrub off skin every time they dry off. The smelly showers sink down into the drain instead of stepping you up a bit off the rarely washed floor. 
   The free weight section of the gym rivals what you would expect from an apartment building. If you like waiting to find a bench in a crowded section of the gym, then you will love this oversight. Maybe lose an office or 2 on the gym level to actually put in some more equipment,hmmmm, choices. 
   The entire cardio section of the gym is great but why in the world does it all face the direction of the tv's? Each machine has it's own tv built in, thousands were spent in large palm trees, the windows face these and the beautiful unique job Green Valley Ranch did with their exterior, why not have some of the machines face out the windows? It would be great to look out and see the world without having to face a television but no, this gym is not about looking outside. 
     A large section of the gym by the cardio equipment is used just to sign people up for personal training. In this section one of the offices even has a fantastic window overlooking GVR but don't worry, the stretching section isn't in this great light space, nope it's in the middle...facing yet another wall. The guest experience isn't nearly as important as how much they can sell you, every corner is a shop or ad space for cars, it's just weird and makes the guest feel like they are at an old mall.  
   The area of this gym also has great views of the strip but none of these views are incorporated into the design.  It is clear that they did not want to create a unique space special for Las Vegas they just wanted to create the same tired building they have done over and over again. This is just lazy. It shows corporate leadership has no vision of the future, no ability to push boundaries and be inventive in showing respect to this great city and the beautiful mountains that surround us. Hire a designer! Vegas deserves better, we are surrounded by opulent spaces daily, did no-one stay at a nice hotel when they were here? Did no-one think, wow maybe we should up our game and not follow the same design we have used for the last 20 years, maybe not use the same materials we have used for the last 20 years? It's hard to feel motivated or inspired here when it is presented as a bad flip from House Hunters. 
   The pool area is great, odd to sell alcohol at a gym but I totally get it, if you can make money and have that country club vibe go for it! Use that money to update the building from an office building with a gym to a luxury gym. Great job on hiring a staff that is helpful and knowledgeable. Corporate could learn a lot from the front line. If not then a company like Equinox will move into this market and really show Las Vegas what a luxury gym is supposed to look like. If the CEO is unable to update a product with so much going for it then it is time to replace the leadership that has forgotten how to lead and now is only following. Set the standard or you fall behind.",Beauty
JZhoSDNN0jCXwWBgoBVuVw,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,pRfIJ6zurjEsWmJheDOP6A,2012-02-20,"My parents finally came through, albeit belatedly, with my birthday dinner (there was too much going on during the past few weekends for the family to get together) tonight. I had been wanting to try Pan Asia for some time as its been around for quite a while, but Sis was still under the weather...so we got take-out. 

Yes, Japanese take-out. I even had sushi. I didn't even know that was possible, let alone gastronomically correct, but hey, they offer Chinese also, so it can't be that much of a sin. 

We had ourselves a feast of feasts, so a list is in order: Shrimp Egg Rolls, Fried Pork Dumplings, Beef Skewers, Beef Fried Rice, Chilean Sea Bass (for Dad), Singapore Mee Fun (for Mum), Sesame Chicken (for Sis), Gyoza, Volcano Roll (I think there were 6 total), and Seafood Yaki Udon. By the way, the last 3 were my picks, but we all sampled and shared, like family should. 

""What you doing?"" My family were perplexed at my picture-taking. 

""Yelp, guys. Yelp!"" My mother's eyes rolled, my father groaned, my sister laughed. 

Mom asks, ""That isn't why you wanted take-out from Pan Asia for your birthday, is it?"" 

""Ummm...""

""He reviews EVERYTHING on that goofy site,"" Dad adds, shaking his head. 

Not all of what we ordered was dynamite, but nothing was inedible. The gyoza (seafood dumplings according to the menu) were tasty enough but were also lacking in culinary character or distinctiveness (just what was the 'seafood' anyway?), and the Beef Skewers were somewhat dry, but that's where my very minor criticism ends. Everything else, from usual Chinese fare like the Sesame Chicken, the Beef Fried Rice, and the Pork Dumplings to less-traveled (for me at least) Japanese offerings like the Seafood Yaki Udon won the evening. The Yaki Udon noodles were as bulky as bullrope yet soft as butter and were utterly crowded by shrimp, scallops, crabmeat, and a colorful array of fresh vegetables. The sushi rolls were tremendous and along with all else we brought home, held up well. Sushi has been getting a backlash like cupcakes currently are; they're trendy, flashy, but damn it, sushi's pretty damn toothsome, not to mention filling. The Volcano Rolls had salmon, avocado, a burningly arcane ""hot"" sauce, and capelin roe (masago) all wrapped up in a rich, heavy wad of supple white rice. 

I don't know if any of this is authentic. I don't care if any of it's authentic. It was just stomach-stuffing excellence. 

And while were on this tack, take my father's Chilean Sea Bass. An alchemistic,  nectarous sauce as sytgian as demon's blood coats a swollen filet of that which rivals lobster, the fearsome looking Patagonian toothfish, and with your first luscious, fall-apart bite, you have found Zion. I was envious of my father, but alas, there was too much for him to eat alone and too much else for him to try, so barter we all did, just so we could try what appears to be Pan Asia's optimum dish. Every one of Pan Asia's detractors need to try this dish. 

As far was the remainder goes, the pork dumplings were yet another great example of that staple of appetizers, the Sesame Chicken was triumphantly tender and candied, the beef fried rice was quite tasty with its generous chunks of meat and ideal rice, and Dear Mother's Singapore Mee Fun was a titillatingly tangled mess of Oriental goodness. So, out of 10 dishes, there were 8 winners, and 2 also-rans that were not at all dreadful. How could I not give them a 5?

Going back to the take-out aspect, each menu item we ordered was packed expertly, all of it fitting tidily in a box and arriving at the correct temperature. I often take this part of dining experiences for granted but will no more. 

If Pan Asia's take-out was of this high quality, eating in must be extraordinary. That can only mean one thing: Chef Wen Chun Yu is a true champion of the kitchen and deserves your dollars. This area is no wasteland. Ignore anyone who tells you differently. If and when I visit the restaurant, I shall shake Mr. Yu's hand and thank him personally for the grand smorgasbord he made for my family and I.",Restaurant

Hanyo poolside service is just awful. There is no other way to put it. The bartenders, the waiters, the towel boys are all lazy, uncaring, and neglectful. I think it is a complete joke that gratuity is added to all tickets when it's like pulling teeth to get any service. The first waiter was slow.  Then he ""forgot"" to bring me my change from my bill. I had to ask the new waiter for him to bring me my change. That made me feel awkward, and like I was being the rude one. Then the new waiter completely ignored us, even when I put an entire row of flags up to get his attention. I went to the bar, ordered a drink, drank the entire contents, used the restroom, all while the flags were up and ignored. The area was not crowded. I took that time to go up to the front desk and complain. Time out from my vacation. Time away from relaxing. My husband works 80 hours a week, I run a small business, and we can't even go to an ""upscale"" resort and be served a drink. At that point I decided that I didn't care to spend any more of my hard earned money at the pool.  

The shuttle should have an expected schedule. The idea of it is nice. Waiting 45 minutes for it, and having the casino valet call the driver twice, apologizing to us for what is not his mistake, is not nice. And God forbid that the driver be pleasant. The first one was talking on her cell phone to her kids the entire way. Does that seem safe? Apparently she is following the criteria to work for Sheraton. I'm seeing a pattern here. 

My husband ordered room service around 6:30pm. The food was good. But I did not appreciate coming back to the room at 11:30pm to see the plates still sitting there on the floor. To me that just screams, ""roach attack""! But what should I expect when our room had very obviously been half heartedly cleaned? The sheets and comforter weren't even on straight when we arrived. 

The icing on top of the cake was the fire alarm situation. That really should have been handled in a more professional manner. I expect to have something like that told to me when I'm booking my reservation, or at the very least at check in. The front desk informed me that they did not receive the information until 6pm the previous night. What would have been acceptable (if that is even true) would be to leave a recorded message on all the room's telephones. If I would not have left the room at 9:15am to get a newspaper I would have never seen the notice that was at the front of my door. I would have been inappropriately scared at that point. We rushed to check out just to avoid the screeches. Yet again, no relaxation to be had at The Sheraton at Wildhorse Pass! 

When checking out I saw an error on my printed receipt. The Hanyo Grill had charged us for a bill that we did not owe. We paid for every single item in cash. Another way to get extra money and extra gratuity out of us it seems. Disgraceful. Luckily, the clerk promptly took it off our bill. Let's see if it shows up on our bank statement. As you can see, I have no trust or faith in your institution. After 3 years in a row of stays at your hotel, I can confidently say that we will never return to your property. 

I was supposed to have the manager call me today to discuss these issues. Would you be surprised to find out that my phone hasn't rung?!",Restaurant

I had booked us in for a massage, and a facial. For those that don't know, a facial is when someone spends an hour rubbing your face with cream. Important point to note - These are paid professionals. If you do this on your own time, with strangers, you will get arrested... I found out in an embarrassing misunderstanding I don't need to go into here...

We arrived, and met Thomas and Brenda. These were our masseuses. They took us back to a room and asked us what we wanted. My wife - having more experience of these things - outlined exactly what she'd like dealt with. I explained to Thomas that I'd never had a massage before. He told me there were many different approaches to massage - full body, hot stone, etc. I got a little scared so I just asked him to do what he thought would be best. 

After we prepared, Thomas and Brenda began to work on us. At this point, we got to know them both a little better. Brenda was like a massage ninja - Silently working on my wife's body, with only noises of approval to tell her that what she was doing had worked. Thomas was not a ninja. He talked and chatted and helped me understand what he was doing, all as he made various parts of my body feel pain they hadn't felt in years.

...Now, that sounds like a bad thing. It really wasn't. It was years of tension leaving muscles that I didn't know I had. Thomas was a great character and wonderful personality who - and I'm going to go out on a limb here - juggles in his spare time. I'm fairly sure of it. When you go to Oasis Spa to get a massage (and you should) - just before you get there, picture a juggler. Then ask to meet Thomas. I guarantee he will look like the picture in your head. Thomas - If you aren't a juggler already, you're missing your calling. But, let's be honest, you DO juggle, don't you? 

Yep. Thought so.

Eventually, the massage was over. I had expected to feel a bit better afterwards, but the difference was night and day. I felt more relaxed than I had in years! My body felt rejuvenated! I could bend in ways that were so bendy my wife told me to stop it because I was embarrassing her!

With that complete, we moved onto the facial. Trisha took my wife into one room, and Crystal took me into another. Never having had a facial either, I had no idea what to expect. It turns out, you lay on your back - they blow steam in your face - and paint what I presume is guacamole on your face. I wish I could tell you more about the facial, but it turns out it is very hard to stay awake while they do this to you - Particularly after they've told you to stop licking the cream off your face because apparently it's not guacamole. 

With that we were done - But then - at the last minute - my wife asked if we could get pedicures as well! Now, important thing to note here - my wife never treats herself. And she definitely deserves it, because she's wonderful. So I was quick to agree! Well... I was quick to ask what a pedicure was - then agree! Turns out it's a facial for your feet! Same principle almost exactly - lots of heat and cream - it's just more difficult to lick it off your feet. 

Trisha came along with us to work on my wife's pedicure, after completing her facial - I presume she takes the whole idea of 'end to end service' somewhat literally... So we spent time with Trisha and Lissa who were extremely patient with us. ...Okay, with me. My wife has had a pedicure before. I had never yet had to encounter how incredible weird I felt with someone else working on my feet. It may be just because I always imagine my feet to be like Hobbit feet, if Hobbits were real - With really horrible feet. I've never been happy with them my whole life - so to have someone staring at them for a solid thirty minutes was odd. However - the Spa team were great! They explained what they were doing, they stepped me through it, and one of them even kindly held me down when the other accidentally tickled my feet. 

I want to make the next point very clear - I really thought going into the day that I'd sit with gritted teeth patiently waiting for it to end - but it was a truly wonderful experience. At the very end of the day, the only concern left was paying the bill. It was then I was exposed to the fact that Oasis Spa offers discounts for multiple purchases, etc. So I even spent less than I planned! 

Joking aside, it was a wonderfully rejuvenating day, spent with kind, friendly people - and cost less than I would have imagined for the quality of service we were given. I can't wait to go back, and neither can my wife - Which is why I'm trying to cause her as much stress as possible to give us an excuse! :)",Beauty

We went as a very large group for a surprise birthday dinner party for a friend, and our waiter was extremely accommodating and all around, just a great guy.  He was attentive to the fact that a surprise birthday includes the surprise part so he made sure he closed the doors that led to our dining area so our friend was genuinely surprised when he came in!  Also he was sure to consistently come around to ask if we wanted to order any drinks, get refills, etc. and had a positive,upbeat attitude the whole time.

As for the location: easy to find, right across Keg Mansion on Jarvis and situated in a very old building dating back to the mid 1800s.  Apparently most of the ceiling work in this building is original so make sure you have a look if you're dining in one of the rooms.  The washrooms are downstairs and a bit cramped, but will do in a pinch if you realy need to go.  The decor is very 1920s-1940s feel, which fits with this building.  The atmosphere was quite lively and loud in the main dining areas, so it would be a great place to have dinner with friends but not for quiet, intimate dates.

Now for the food: 

They give you baskets of bread to start with balsamic vinegar\/olive oil bottles so you can dip the bread in whatever you wish.

Appetizer: Melanzane Alla Parmigiana - delicious friend eggplant with fresh tomato sauce, basil and buffalo mozzarella.  And by delicious, I mean absolutely a must-try if you come to this place.

Main: I ordered the Penne All' Arrabiata which is penne with tomato, extra virgin olive oil and fresh chili peppers.  The way they made this sauce was really good...definitely the most unique and yummy penne I have eaten.  The chilli peppers added a nice 'kick' to the taste while not making the dish unbearably spicy.  My bf, who does not usually eat spicy food, really liked this dish as well.  I will be ordering another dish to try next time, just so I can try more variety on their menu.

The bf ordered Porchetta pizza, so it was topped with braised pork, fior di latte, roasted peppers, onions and tomato sauce.  He's a big pizza fan and really liked this pizza.

The portions were good, so by the time we finished eating, we were too stuffed to order dessert since our friend's birthday cake was being served.  One thing they do charge if you are thinking of having a birthday event here is the cake cutting fee, which for our large group of approximately 20 people, meant $50 fee.  Our waiter already notified about this when we reserved the table, so it was not a shock.

The waiter gave us a combined bill initiallly but made sure to come back and split the bill for us after we told him some of the guests wanted to pay using card while others had cash.  Very courteous and friendly throughout the entire evening.

Overall, I do recommend a visit here if you are into Italian food.  They have something for everyone on the menu.",Restaurant

After going for a few follow-up color\/cut appointments, post our initial lightening, I've went back to my original stylist. He immediately saw the issue with my color (the ""band"" of hair color lighter than the rest) & that was fixed pretty fast. I've realized the issue at this place is completely inadequate light which made it hard for the stylist to see exactly what the problem with my color was.

Update: I just wanted to add that after seeing Sabrina today (April 11th) for the correction, I'm left with a much better impression overall. Thank you for making me happy! Both the color and the cut were fixed to my liking!

Contrary to all the previous amazing reviews, my experience was not up to par to my (high) expectations. I have purchased a Buytopia deal for 39 for ""cut, color or highlights, deep conditioning treatment, neck and shoulder massage, champagne and chocolates"". I also intended to do a color correction at this salon. I have booked a consultation session with Sabrina regarding the process, which went extremely well - we discussed and agreed on the color I wanted to achieve & Sabrina even snipped a lock of my hair to experiment the color correction treatment on. Needless to say, I was going into my appointment with extremely high hopes - sort of really excited to change up my color & having faith in stylists' work.
We have started off with the color ""stripping"" process so we could lighten up my very dark brown shade. The treatment didn't feel uncomfortable but at one point I could hear the girls chatting about the steps of this procedure and one of them told my stylist that she can Google it for her. That was a bit worrying. After the treatment was done, my hair was washed out a few times, and next the new color was applied. By the way, at no point during my 3 hour appoint was I offered water or the massage that my purchase was including. When I asked about the massage at the receptionist desk, she suggested that that it was done while I was getting my hair washed - how can a shoulder and a neck massage be given during the wash beats me. 
The coloring part of the appointment seemed to go well - my hair was washed off once again, Sabrina has assured me that it looks nice - from what I could see in the mirrors in the salon light it did look good. Next was my cut appointment with Melanie, who immediately assured me that she loves bobs & loves cutting them as well. I was under full impression that I will leave the salon with a fantastic cut. Well it wasn't - one side was left longer than the other which I noticed in the washroom mirror and went back to ask for a fix. For some reason Melanie insisted on layering the opposite side of my cut more..? After the first fix, I decided to fix my parting and noticed that one side is still longer than the other. My cut was basically done around my side parting - which would mean every time I change the spot where my hair parted, it would make one side longer. By this time Melanie's next client was waiting and she was seemingly in a rush to finish up with me. From what I could see the cut was fixed. Both girls have told me repeatedly that the color looks great. I've looked at my color at both the washroom mirror and the salon mirrors and everything looked good.
Like I mentioned, the massage wasn't done and neither was the champagne offered. The trouble started when I got home and looked in my mirror - the color was NOT what we agreed on. The roots are now darker and a big section of my hair looks brassy, and it goes back to brown on the ends. It seems that the new color was not able to set in properly to cover all the ""stripped"" sections. My cut is still not symmetrical, with one side being longer. I have called the salon immediately and we have made an appointment for Thursday to have the color fixed, somehow. To top it all, I think I'm having an allergy reaction to the treatment that I had done to strip the hair of color - the left side of my scalp is numb for 2 days now 
All in all I feel very let down - I have forgone the trip to my usual salon because I felt that their charge for color correction was very high, and decided to try out a ""deal"" place instead. I've had much better cuts in the past & my color, well I feel it would look much better if I just asked for a root touch-up instead.",Beauty

Don't go here...!

If you don't like smoke- don't go here.  If you have OCD and get hives when you see dust- don't go here.  If you don't like friendly old guys reliving their youth- don't go here.  If you're afraid of parallel parking- don't go here.  If you are allergic to vinyl seating surfaces- don't go here.  If you can't stand mellow classic rock (read: Led Zepplin)- don't go here.  If you're in a hurry- don't go here.  If you request 'Non-Smoking' ALL the time- don't go here.  If you are trying to become a hipster by smoking cigars- don't come here.  

Have I made my point?  But you're still reading...?  Great, then read on...

If you enjoy a good smoke, if you have a few hours to kill, if you love the idea of smoking in your own living room but hate the 'sticky-dirt' that accumulates on the walls only to be evident when you move your pictures around and find that your walls are 3 shades darker than when you first painted them, if you enjoy hearing stories that start out- 'When I was younger...' or 'When I was your age...', if you're not allergic to dust, if you have an open mind... you get the idea.  This place is a gem.

I'm a chill, relaxed, open minded, live & let live, love to hear stories, love to tell stories, love to BYO (as you can carry a 6 pack in here) kind of guy.  I was brought up in a 2 smoker household, my father quit cold turkey when I was about 12, my mother has reduced her cigarette intake drastically but still smokes daily.  I turned out ok.  No lasting effects, no long term issues.  I can't recall when I tried my first cigar and I can admit- I wasn't hooked.  I have evolved over time.  Now when I want to relax, when I want to recharge, I head to Blooms.  

Cigar Camp happens every Saturday.  What's that, you ask?  It's kind of like WDVE's Electric Lunch.  Michelle Michaels asks for 'lunch requests', she promises to 'try to get it on...' she 'Cooks it up & serves it hot'... but there's no lunch.  Here at Blooms- there's no Camp.  There's no tents, no campfire, no smores...  What there is is a very friendly owner (Mark) holding court and acting like the moderator of the debate on life.  My wife learned about Furries here, for god's sake!  She thought I was pulling her leg when I tried to explain it but after our second visit to Blooms when the old guys were discussing the upcoming weekend, she learned all she needed to know.  Cigar Camp does feed you though- there's usually ribs, corn bread, pulled pork, slaw, potato chips, all supplied by Mark (with a required purchase of course.  We all know there's No Free Lunch).  The 'campers' also bring stuff and we had our first taste of home-made Lemoncello here.    

Our first visit we learned how to get free cigars.  Years ago there was a bar in Homestead named Chiodos.  Chiodos was decorated with eclectic stuff.  Eclectic stuff and Bra's...  TONS of Bra's...  Well, I'm not sure who 'came' first- Blooms or Chiodos but Mark has bras all over the ceiling of the humidor.  I guess it keeps the cigars happy.  Anyway- we were taking the tour and my wife asked about them.  Turns out- if you give him your bra- you get a free cigar.  If you take it off in front of the 'cigar smoking court'- you get 2 cigars.  If you let him take a polaroid- 3 cigars.  My loving and open minded wife earned me 2 free cigars.  Pictures don't lie- but reviews can, she said.  ;) 

As for prices and the review that says the prices are high... Are you HIGH...?  Mark will take you to the $2 bin and tell you that this cigar is better than the $14 one 2 shelves over.  He'll tell you that the $4 ones are only half as good as the $8 ones.  He's not trying to win you over- he's telling you to think for yourself.  We're all individuals with our own tastes.  Try the $2 ones first, if you don't like them try a different one.  There's that saying that says 'You eat with your eyes first...' and those $2 cigars don't look like much but they have every bit as much taste as a $10 one with a fancy band.  Tell Mark what you want to spend and he'll pick the best cigar for your needs...  

Where am I gong with this review...?  I'm not exactly sure.  It's my very own 'trip down memory lane' that's continuously being added to, I guess.  But in the infamous words of Jimmy Buffett- 'The best navigators are not quite sure where they're going until they get there...'

My girlfriend and I have been dying to try this place for sometime, the planets line up correctly and we decided to give it a go... 

SERVICE-

We arrived at 5:30 on a weekday evening. the Hostess was friendly and somewhat prompt. as we we seated at our table, we noticed the Sushi bar was full but the dining room had vast seating. While the hostess selected for a very small table in direct sunset sunlight, we redirected her to a more spacious booth in a more comfortable area.

We were told the usual ""your server will be with you in just a moment"" ... 30 mins later no one had even taken our drink order. This wasn't because they were swamped, there may have been 8 tables occupied at the time, but because our server was more interested in being a social butterfly than attending to our table.

Once we complained, the Chef came out to apologize. Nice enough guy and I would've been alright with things except instead of acknowledging the poor service, he made the excuse for his staff that there had been a ""simultaneous seating"" which was FAR from true. At this point, I was truly looking forward to an exceptional and interesting meal. Oh the dreams of fools...

FOOD -

For Appetizers, we opened with the Grilled 5 Spice Lamb Chops and the Korean Street Tacos. Both were just okay. Not as much flavor as I was expecting\/hoping for. Best thing was the salad that accompanied the Lamb Chops

Next we grabbed a couple of rolls of Sushi, The M Girl and a Geisha Girl. The sushi rolls were actually the best part of the meal and if by some odd twist of fate I end up in this place again, that is all I would have!

In the Rice\/Noodles area we tried a couple of ""hard to get wrong"" basic dishes, Chinese Fried Rice and Pad Thai Noodles. Both of these dishes were horrible to the point of complaint. They were both flavorless and greasy\/oily. Just really poorly prepared and we had them removed from the bill.

For entrees, we tried the Beef & Broccoli along with the Crispy Fried Tai Snapper. Both had potential, but the sauces used were just way too sugary and sweet. I swear, the sauce on the snapper tasted like a diluted, warmed, jam.

ATMOSPHERE

Most disappointing thing here wasn't even at our table, but directly in front of us. The hostess continued to seat patrons in a seating area where the refused to lower the blinds, though the dining area is surrounded by windows. We watched 3 sets of tables complain about the blinds while the 6:30-7:30 July western sun beamed down on them without mercy. No one in the establishment seemed to even care no matter what was said to them.

Enter this establishment only if want to extend a horrible night at the tables and make it even worse. Invested $150+ and gained the knowledge that I will never set foot in the place on my own accord again.",Beauty
pGHdLRqZaNBOpGKiZvJ-PQ,NnMN10F4wDuBKv25vCqcCg,A_eOsa1xKsOzN-3cZ8Tohw,2009-11-26,"We were back out in Fountain Hills yesterday to drop off some jewelry at Style With A Twist, a fun ladies clothing and accessory boutique. Our friend Candy, the owner, enthusiastically told us about a new restaurant that she thought we'd like. She was especially happy because it was one we hadn't yet heard about. It's called MPJ's Grill and Restaurant, and it turns out to be catty-corner from Phil's (see below). We had, in fact, driven right by without noticing it when we ate there last week.

The chef\/owner who used to work at Phil's has put together a nice menu, much smaller and slightly more upscale but with comparable prices. There are 7 starters including crab cakes and seared tuna, each $7, two quesadillas, and a shrimp and avocado tower ($7). We shared a cup of corn chowder (a steal at $2), loaded with fresh corn kernels and subtly spiced. Since we were both very hungry we skipped the salads and sandwich portion of the menu and settled on meat - NY strip steak ($14) for me, with blackened spices and blue cheese. Ken ordered the marinated  center cut pork chops with melted gorgonzola ($11) which Candy had raved about. Each came with a side salad and choice of potato - mashed, rosemary roasted or fries - or rice. No veggies. 

The salad was disappointing. It was clearly made from bagged lettuce blend, and none too fresh. A few chopped tomatoes and cukes had been added. The thousand island dressing was quite good (it tasted very much like Phil's), the blue cheese dressing was mediocre. We perked up when our entrees arrived. My steak was quite large, and spread with a melty blue cheese\/cream cheese mixture. It was cooked medium rare as I had requested, and was tender and not fatty. The pork chops were the real hit. They were juicy as could be, flavorful, and well served by their blue cheese topping. Our rosemary potatoes were good too, although I would have liked them to be a little crisper on the outside. The one jarring note was the clump of lettuce mixture used to garnish the plate - it was useless, messy and certainly didn't add to the presentation. That aside, we were very happy with our choices, particularly for the price.

MPJ's has only been open since the end of June, but they have quite a following. We had arrived at 5 PM, and by 6 PM there were people waiting for tables. I hope that both this place and Phil's will each survive the competition. Once they get a liquor license MPJ's will likely be even more popular. They're already expanding into the next store front. In the meantime, the decor is nonexistent. And the bathroom is outside around the corner. Their website stresses the notion that this is a ""fine dining"" restaurant, and shows a very misleading photo. But really, this is just a place to come to get a good solid meal at a remarkably good price.

So, let me finish telling you about the menu. There are 8 main- dish salads, most around $8. In the sandwich department there are 6 different burgers ($7 and $8) and they looked really delicious. Paninis, club sandwiches, and wraps round out this category. And finally, there are 8 pastas, from $10 to $13. Sugar spiced salmon with creamy spinach pasta and Romano cheese tempted me. The desserts sounded ""corporate"", cheesecake, tiramisu and chocolate cake. We didn't try any.",Restaurant

The rasul room for the mud baths is pretty cool!  You can also bring in alcoholic beverages from Canyon Ranch Grill! Awesome!!!

I came here on 12\/18\/13.  It was my birthday, and my boyfriend had surprised me with a spa day.  We got the Ultimate Couples Relaxation Package, and I believe there was a discount for us.  However, despite the discount, it was still pretty pricy, but ultimately very RELAXING!  

I was here before, about a year or two ago with girlfriends, and was pretty unimpressed by the services and amenities.  After going to Qua (at Caesar's), you'd understand where I'm coming from, but this particular visit was pretty amazing!

Our appointment was at 11:00am, and we had arrived at around 10:30 to get settled in.  The ladies room was well kept at all times.  There are showers, sinks, and areas to glam yourself up.  There is also a sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi in the women's area.  All nice, clean and relaxing. In addition to this, there is a large room, filled with couches and magazines to peruse as you wait for treatment.  

One thing I love about Canyon Ranch are the ""co-ed"" areas--the main room (the ""Conservatory""), beautifully decorated--couches and loungers everywhere to relax and have some fruit and tea.  Although, instead of the serene water fountain, I wish they had a co-ed pool or jacuzzi in this area to up the relaxation level.  The other co-ed room is called the ""Salt Grotto.""  This room is darkly lit with red lighting, heated to a nice, warm 85 degrees.  The benches, floor, and walls are all heated.  The ""sea air"" is supposed to help you relax when you're in this room.  The seats, although heated, were not that comfy.  My boyfriend preferred the ""Wave Room.""  This room was also darkly lit, but blue; and the ceiling reflected the water located in the center of the room, surrounded by ergonomic-styled chairs to lie down and watch the ceiling.  The room and chairs were not warmed--it was rather quite cool for me, but it definitely served an environment for a quick cat nap.  All these areas were very nice, quite and relaxing.  

On to the treatments.  The Ultimate Couples Relaxation Package which included the Couples Rasul mud bath\/shower and a Couples Massage.  The Couples Rasul has got to be by far one of the most unique treatments I've ever experienced.  The attendant brought us into a dimly lit room.  There were two lounge chairs, towels, and a large steam shower.  The shower was beautiful.  The tiles were blue, and the ceiling reflected ""stars"" and ""rained"" water at the end of the treatment.  There were two concave seats that faced each other, two handheld shower-heads, and aromatic steam that releases during the shower, as you rub each other down with the selection of imported muds to cleanse and exfoliate.  It was sensual, relaxing, and fun.  

The couples Rasul was about an hour long, and afterwards, we hung out in the Conservatory room for about half an hour, and were ushered into our couples massage.  The massage was great.  It was about 50 minutes long.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it.

After our treatments, we went to the Canyon Ranch Grill and spent the $40 certificate that was included into our package.  We ordered the kale chips with ranch--delicious!  I ordered the portobello mushroom stuffed with quinoa and burrata cheese, on top of a baby spinach salad.  This was good and healthy!  My boyfriend ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich.  This was good.  It had grilled chicken, grilled red onions and peppers, and avocado.  I also ordered a mimosa.  The meal totaled to about $40--perfect for our certificate!  We left tip, of course.  

All in all, I really enjoyed our spa day, mostly because of the couples treatments and coed areas, and the fact that there were NO people really.  Apparently, Vegas is pretty much deserted right before Christmas.  And then Christmas hits, and it's like a zoo! LOL!  They have a lot of specials during this time of year to try to attract customers on such a slow day.  I'm sure it's starting to get crowded again now that NYE is just a couple days away.  But Canyon Ranch is definitely a great spa to check out!",Beauty

I walked in with a quart of paint I had bought here  in the past to get another quart. It was an ""oops"" but nonetheless, I needed another quart  and wanted the same brand of paint color matched.
Seeing the paint fella was busy with another customer, I proceeded down the isle to get the proper base can ready and save him a minute or two... He exclaimed ""you won't find no paint colors down there"". This was belittling. Why did he assume where I should be looking to shop? I am no feminist by any means, yet I sure felt like since I was a woman, he was directing me to my place at the paint chips and not in the isle of actual paint products.
Now it was my turn. He seen I had grabbed the matching base and I think it pissed off his ego. He proceeded to lecture me on how the machine will tell him what base to use. Really? Seemed pretty obvious to me a shade of muttled black would probably need the exact same can of base. I was belittled again.
I proceed to shop around for other things, the fella who helped me get a drill bit and the lady who let me into the spray paint were both awesome.
I came back to see how the paint guy was doing. He seen me and muttered ""I am still working on it"".  I wondered why I heard no blow dryer drying a sample or anything, but anyways...
He shows me the match he made. It was jet black and the best he could do. Ok. I let him know politely that is the worse color match I have ever seen from a machine. He proceeds to lecture me on the machine and how the paint it too old, so it cannot code the color. And because it is so thick, it also cannot code the color. He suggests I put a 1\/4 cup,of water in it to thin it and get a smooth surface paint sample for him to scan, because he does not have the capability and tools to make a paint sample here. I even stick my finger in and spread the paint thinly on the lid to make a paint sample for him to scan. He says the lid is too warped for that. Shows me his scan gun and lectures me on how the device works, what size sample he needs and smooth to make it work. He then shows me his stir stick that he dipped (and yes, there was only 1"" of paint in it, air was in the can, it did thicken up) and explains it won't dry enough for him or the surface is not smooth enough to get a proper sample, if I bring him one maybe he will have better luck. I was searching the area for the blow dryer I never heard, you know like other places use to dry a sample on scrap card stock. Anyways, I walk away, literally rolling my eyes. 
As I checkout with my old quart and the lid loose, I ask for a piece of tape to hold it in place. I realize it was warped and well used from many times opening it. Wouldn't good customer service have realized that? When he hears me ask that clerk, he then pipes up offering more tape to hold the lid closed. He also sees that I am rolling the paint on my finger, drying it off, from sticking it in the can and offers for me to use the sink down the isle to wash my hand?! I just about blew my top....
You even have a sink handy and cannot use it to thin my paint to help with that sample to scan? You are really sending me home to make a paint sample? Wow. 
I check out with the other items, no paint, head home and make a paint sample...
And head directly to Lowes to get a quart of color matched paint. It took ten minutes. Done deal, perfect match. $15 Ace did not get.
I contemplate with all my time wasted why this guy was so weird about it all? Is he incompetent or even being thoughtful, maybe his boss doesn't provide scrap paper and a blow dryer? I found my answer when I returned to Ace to return the other items I had bought. I couldn't stand the thought that they got those purchases when this experience was so stupid and unnecessary. The clerk asked why I was returning everything, I responded because of  the belittling experience I had. I even admitted I was so pissed off at first, I left so I wouldn't be mean. I pointed out if she could mention to the manager to provide the paint department with scrap paper and a blow dryer so they could help make a proper sample for scanning. She said ""he is the manager."", the guy making paint. 
Great, no point in complaining to him then.
My ""old paint"" was purchased less than a year ago at that store.
I have been painting houses for 25 years, this guy misjudged my 5'3"" female self. In my own painting business, my ""paint people"" could match better than that by eye. I have seen professional paint mixers code match from rough surfaces such as fabric and textured wall paper long before the fancy scan machines of today. 
I will happily pay more for good customer service, this manager needs a few lessons in that department. I will not return. 
Something that should have taken 20 minutes turned into 1 1\/2 hours.",Shopping

And I live in New York City.  That an Italian restaurant nearly across the country would not only win over my stomach but my heart is a major deal given that I come from the world of great Italian cuisine.  That all being said, La Fontanella continues to exceed my expectations and win over everyone that I bring with me to eat their food.  I feel like an insider at this point given that I've eaten there so often that I ended up having my wedding reception there.  But given that the owners are so present and charming in the place day in and day out, you'll feel like a regular on your very first visit.

I've seen the other negative reviews on here and I have to tell you that if you are looking for a run-of-the-mill, inexpensive red-sauce joint, this is not the place for you.  La Fontanella is for gourmands and romantics who are serious about quality ingredients and dishes prepared with a heavy measure of love.  Everything (and I mean every last thing) from pasta to sauces to dessert is made in house, and special dishes are focused on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  Case in point - we begged for the artichokes in August that we enjoyed in March, but the owner wouldn't dare serve them to us out of season.  Not because she wanted to deny us our request, but that she only wanted to serve us the best of the best.

Cutting to the chase, on my first visit we decided to take a tour of the menu and see what would blow us away.  We started with stuffed mushrooms (luscious and savory), artichokes braised in olive oil (garlicky goodness) and the popular suppli (addictive fried rice balls stuffed with oozy mozzarella, served over homemade bolognese).  The appetizers were rich enough to almost make a meal, but we charged forth nonetheless.  We ordered the Seabass Adriatico (hands-down my favorite - moist flaky filet topped with a toothsome dressing of tomatoes and basil), Pork Loin with Fig Compote, simply grilled lamb chops (great with a squeeze of lemon), and Pescatore Diabolo, a fiery assortment of seafood and crushed red pepper over a tangle of fettucine.  Stuffed and happy, we couldn't eat another bite...and yet, we managed dessert - homemade gelato and zuppa inglese.  A night to remember, we lumbered to the car knowing that we had found a new favorite.

On subsequent visits, we found other new favorites, like the sinfully rich Gnocchi with Prosciutto and Peas (aka the night where my friend Dave asked for thirds on the homemade bread and dipping oil) and the homemade grilled sausage skewers (aka the night where my husband asked if I could go back into the kitchen and beg to learn the recipe).  

If you are in the neighborhood and are looking for a treat of the most authentically Italian kind, this is the way to go.  From the romantic, candlelit interior, jovial (and often talkative) servers, to the detail placed on quality ingredients, La Fontanella is memorable and instantly lovable.  It is absolutely no surprise that this place has been around since the 80s, and I'm only sad that I hadn't found it sooner!

PS. Know that the place tends to close early - the rush is usually at around 5pm and by 8pm the place is quieting down.  Good to know if you want to beat the throngs (or why it's emptier later at night!)",Restaurant
jXK_mhbcg_Gbgp6-vT_5vg,PHl0poFyk2IntQ44VqGh4g,ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw,2012-07-04,"My experience here was nothing less than memorable.  As far as buffet's are concerned, The Buffet at Bellagio is the best buffet I've ever been to so far.  I have yet to the buffet at the Wynn, and maybe when I go there, this will get bumped to second, but I was extremely satisfied.

I'll first start with the downsides of the buffet, which are relatively small and can be easily over looked.  First of all, if you go during peak dinner hours on a saturday night, expect at least a 45+ minute wait.  I can't ding the restaurant for being extremely successful though, but just keep that in mind. The food is totally worth the wait.  Second downside was the price.  I went with a group of more than 8 so they included an 18% gratuity before we even went in so the total price was close to $46 which is a little steep, but hey, YOLO.  Besides, its not like I go to vegas every weekend so splurging on a first time experience was something I needed to at least once.

Now, after I waited out the 45 minutes of hunger pains and coughed up the dough to pay for the dinner, I was in heaven.  Surprisingly, the decor was more simple than I was expecting for The Bellagio, but it was nice and clean.  Who goes to a buffet to look at the walls anyway?  Within seconds of being shown to our table, I immediately jogged over to the food and nearly bit into it right in front of the chefs.  There were all sorts of meats and dishes from different cultures; japanese, chinese, italian, mexican, and more, and each one looked as appetizing as the next.

I started with the heavy foods, the beef wellington, the roasted pepercorn roast beef, the kobe beef, the St Louis ribs, the pork loin, and herb crusted quail.  It reminded me of the scene from the Hunger Games when Katniss went to the Capitol and was introduced to extravagant foods for the first time.  I wish I had a third or fourth stomach so I could eat more than a fair share.  Anyhow, all the meats were superb, except for the kobe beef.  Mine was a tad bit dry, probably because it was cooked 30 minutes before I arrived, but non the less, it was still tasty.  All the other meats were so juicy and spectacular that my mouth is watering as I type this review and remember it all.

After my first plate of heavy meats, I went on to try all the pastas in the Italian department.  There were several pasta dishes which I tried and can't remember the name of, but they were all fantastic as well.  Next up was the japense sushi, the chinese wontons, chinese chicken, chow mein, and pineapple fried rice.  The california rolls weren't all too fresh but they were decent.  The chinese food was pretty good and I have no complaints here.

All in all, the asian food section of the bar was solid.  The real winner though for me was the assorted meats they had which really hit a home run for me.  I went back for seconds and thirds of the meat and ate until my stomach hated me and I regretted it.  I don't regret it actually.  Anyhow, the desserts there were great as well.  Not only was it great presentation, but they perfected the texture and taste.  My friends loved the macaroons and I love the raspberry sorbet.

Two weeks of working out are now required to cleanse my body of the tsunami of calories that hit it.  So worth it though.",Restaurant

I wrote a honest review n MIKU management actually contacted me directly to come back for a revisit even emailed\/called me to personally apologized and thanking me for helping them to improve service. I was impressed and very excited to come back.

The passer by waiter who wasn't even for my table was aware of it n said no need to pick up from floor. Instead he gave us a new one.

Our waitress was very attentive and very warm. She was very helpful . We were looking for an dinner item at MIKU , they didn't have it for lunch but they totally bent it backwards n made accommodation to make that dish for us anyway. 

The dishes we ordered were Totally delicious! We got fish and chips, and calamari tempura for starters. They were the BEST fish and chips and fried calamaris I have had! The fish came in small pieces two-bites-size I can tell they were NOT frozen fish by their texture. The batter was light golden n fluffy . Very moist bitting into. It came with Thin slices yam chips! I was thinking even if my bad didn't like fish, if we order this dish he could dig on sweet potato chips. My friend's tod loved the yam he pretty much ate all the rest :):) you also get quite a few pieces too 3 of us were able to get at least 2 pieces each person. Unlike some Japanese food u get very tinny serving . The calamari had tinny sea weed pieces in the batter. When the word ""seaweed"" might sound scary to some people in the batter, if you r open mind please give it a chance. It's very tinny amount and does not over power whole flavour of calamari at all. It's drizzled by some other brown sweet savoury sauce. So good I can eat this all day! 

We also ordered the 12 pieces Shoshi that each piece were diff kind of their own ,and the samon sushi. The samon were lightly seared n raw under so you have two kinds of texture biting into. The rice came with sushi is well seasoned\/flavoured . They have the most delicious sushi I have had. U do not need to dip soy sauce or other stuff. 

We also ordered baked muscles that came with bacon and Russell sprouts also seasoned in garlic and n flavoured dipping olive oil  . So good.

Over all I love the atmosphere of this place . It's very warm and inviting. I came before for dinner, this time I came for lunch. The lunch is quite nice since they have high ceiling and all glass window u get quite exposure of sun light for a winter season , any extra sun adds coziness :)

I am very satisfied with the food and service here . They present the true culture of Japanese food at the same time they are very Canadian. I also like the uniforms of employees that they wear well fitted white shirt\/tie\/vest. Even our waitress her outfit actually looked good on her. Kinda sick of some places like Earls or KEG have waitstaff wearing short skirts or Joey wearing cocktail dress. That I can imagine they can make ladies slightly older or kids feel uncomfortable . This place seems more upscale and more friendly towards all ages. Even my friend brought her 2 yr old son it was fine. It's obviously for adults but don't restate to bring ur little one for a lunch treat at Lake front :) 


Expecting for about $35 plus tax n tip for lunch. I am very happy with the food n service. I think you do pay for better Japanese food than average sushi joint! Their stuff is much better seasoned , much Freshier. And the food is packed in flavour ! Each single piece of sushi is individually seasoned in perfection in meat and rice separately. Takes a lot of work making just one plate. And the rice was warm when served which is little but important detail. I'd love to come back soon in the near future and I totally recommend  this place to others :) Japanese culture present a lot of meticulous work in arts n food. This place u can totally experience that if u love seafood :) Hope they have more items for such as beef and chicken for non seafood eaters in the future so if ppl are going for a date ,the ppl don't eat seafood can find something to share . But if you are sushi fan u this place will ruin the rest sushi places for u(in a good way ) hah.",Restaurant
bDqotiuZ5A5DeE6oOB9zLw,NyKFSZALO2r987KWjjkLzA,1Epby_tsFDci4sP0Nbjwsw,2014-07-04,"My husband and I just returned to Toronto following a 23 month trip through Asia & Europe. We spent the bulk of those 2 years in Asia, and spent 5 months in total traveling and eating our way through Vietnam and we both consider Vietnamese food to be one of our favorite types of cuisine. We always said when we returned home that we wouldn't be those annoying people who eat international dishes and then scoff that it's ""so much better in country X"", but... here we are.

We visited Pho Vietnam last night with my parents to celebrate my dad's birthday. Given that we were going out for a special occasion, I really wish I could say something--anything--good about this place. If forced, I guess the price is reasonable for Toronto? $7 or $8 for a bowl of pho doesn't seem too outrageous for this city.

But honestly, you're better off just lighting that money on fire rather than eating anything at this restaurant. Between the four of us, we sampled summer rolls (goi cuon), a bowl of rare beef pho, a rice plate (com dia) with grilled pork, shredded pork, steamed egg omelet & fried egg, a vermicelli rice bowl with grilled pork & spring rolls (bun thit nuong cha gio) and a fried noodle dish that was described as Pad Thai. 

Nothing was remotely authentic whatsoever, and every dish had clearly been modified or watered down for western palates. The closest thing was probably the rolls, which came out with the correct dipping sauce, but unfortunately didn't include fresh mint or any herbs within them as they would always be served in Vietnam. Also, I personally think $10.50 for 4 rolls is insane. The pho came out with just one stalk of basil, and the broth was horribly imbalanced: tasted intensely of cinnamon but nothing else. This is not what pho is supposed to taste like and I've eaten it across the 3000km length of Vietnam. Rice place used the correct rice, but didn't come with nuoc cham sauce, the steamed egg omelet had weird imitation crab in it rather than noodles & pork, and the pork chop (despite looking promising) was utterly flavorless, its marinade clearly comprised predominantly of red food coloring and nothing else; the shredded pork component was good and tasted as it should. The vermicelli bowl, featuring grilled pork, was also bland and didn't involve any fresh herbs. The Pad Thai is obviously not Vietnamese, but certainly wasn't Thai either and tasted like it was using some kind of sweet & sour BBQ sauce.

Vietnamese food is supposed to be light & flavorful, which the food at Pho Vietnam most definitely is not. I suppose I would give it a pass for not being 100% authentic if it was at least tasty, but it isn't. Most of the components in every dish were bland and one-note. While we were there, the restaurant was packed, but not with a single Vietnamese person, which I'm not at all surprised to find. It's disappointing that this is either what is considered good Vietnamese food in Toronto, or that so many people seem to think this is good Vietnamese food. I assure you, it is not.

As others have noted, the service here isn't great. True, the place is busy, but the service is still haphazard and distracted -- we kept needing to ask for more herbs, and we were routinely given incorrect silverware based on our dishes. You never go to a Vietnamese restaurant expecting fantastic service, but this was so disorganized and poor that it certainly couldn't make up for the lackluster food. 

I've racked my brains trying to think of a single thing to redeem it, but just can't. Service is poor and the food is insultingly bad, so who cares if it's relatively cheap? The hunt for good Vietnamese food in the GTA continues, because this sure isn't it!",Restaurant
EOum6ZX8oxA7dnIrwN3-cQ,gklu86V7twINzcO7PagFZg,thR2m3O_PBCCbc5nZSF1Pg,2016-12-22,"I am an Arizona native, and my first time at Minder Binders was in the early 80's. Off and on over the years I returned. More recently since it was remodeled, my wife and I have been there about 4or 5 times in the past year, the last time before this most recent visit before an ASU football game when it was quite busy.
Today however, looking forward to a repeat excellent experience, we just have to ask.....what happened here?  What a disaster.
First we arrived and couldn't locate the hostess, stumbled around like morons trying to figure out where they moved the hostess stand. No luck. Finally asked the bartender. He tells us they no longer have servers, you sit wherever you want, you order and pick up at a counter near the bar. We were given a pager......like you normally receive when waiting to be ""seated"".
Okay...
We placed our orders for a couple of burgers. Weren't asked how we wanted them cooked and forgot to tell them.
As for drinks....my wife ordered iced tea, and myself soda water, both of which had to be obtained from behind the bar, and not available from the soda fountain. We decided on a booth ""in the back"" where we always sit. We couldn't locate any utensils or napkins etc., so finally walked back up front and located spoons and forks, but no knives in bus tubs alongside a wall. Any and all patrons were free to rummage around touching and picking up and redepositing silverware in a very unsanitary manner. I know some fast food restaurants provide ""plastic ware"" in a similar display manner, but hardly all just laying in old bus tubs helter skelter. And then the napkins.....you pull them out of a wall dispenser that feels more like you are pulling out paper towels from the dispenser inside the bathroom, rather than something meant to be hygienic.
Eventually in a ""normal"" amount of time our pager notified us our food was ready. We walked all the way back up to the front. As we approached the area to pick up our food, about four or five patrons were hovering around ""our food"" reaching for it, and asking if it was theirs, and being rebuffed by the ""server"" behind the counter. My wife had to kind of elbow her way up to the counter after many ""excuse me's"" to obtain our ""baskets"" of food. Not a particularly ""appetizing"" start to a meal, feeling like we are a bunch of lions in the jungle fighting for our food, not to mention once again, the feeling, if not an actual fact, of unsanitary issues. I don't know about you, but I really just don't see the need for people not in our party to be hovering over my food. As we picked up the burgers, we were directed back over to the wall where a line of admittedly refrigerated condiments were laid out kind of like a salad bar......except without any sneeze shields, ......just open containers with people reaching over them to get their tomatoes, pickles, onions, etc. I have to wonder whether this is health department compliant. We proceeded back to our table and proceeded to build our otherwise plain burgers on bare buns. We needed ketchup and mustard.......are you kidding me....we have to go all the back up to the front again? Looked around, and found some condiment caddies on nearby tables that had grocery store like squeeze bottles of mustard and ketchup on them. Brought them over to our table and proceeded to use the mustard, flipped open the lid, and found the underside of the lid crusted with dark, dried up, old nasty mustard. At home this happens, yeah, I know it's not that weird, but at home it's my crap! But at a restaurant? Yuck! Then the meal itself.......burgers dry......likely because they were cooked well done, not medium rare as I would have requested had I been asked (or thought to specifically request) at the time of order. My wife ran out of iced tea....but since you can't refill the drink your self at this ""do everything else yourself"" establishment without hiking back to the front once again to have the bartender do it, she just did without. As we walked out of the restaurant, passing many empty server stations, we remarked that at least we didn't have to leave a tip.....but also noting that we probably will not be returning till the next iteration of this establishment changes once again, ( or more likely goes out of business). Now some of you reading this may find the whole self service thing perfectly acceptable......and I guess it is if you want to go to Smashburger (much better burgers), but wait that's right they bring out the food TO YOU, or Someburros, but wait that's right they bring out the food TO YOU, or even Chik-Fil-A, oh, but yeah that's right even they bring the food TO YOU! So if this style is for you great. But if you are going to Minder Binder with even the remotest idea of it being a restaurant in the traditional sense....forget about it. My sense is they must be having financial issues of some kind, because this radical change to your business model just screams of desperation. Good luck is all I can say",Restaurant
M4hlv4J6_kkjmTwDb8oCsg,5ZXT4BQB-C1XjUpKmh7kaQ,4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw,2013-05-05,"We had a beautiful early dinner here on a Saturday night during our Girls' trip to Vegas.  The other ladies had previously been here, and while I have dined at the Eiffel Tower restaurant, I had never been to Mon Ami Gabi.  Who knew you could get such a good view of the Bellagio fountains without actually being at the Bellagio!

Obviously you want to eat on the patio.  We made reservations through OpenTable for 4:45 and requested the patio, but then read that the patio is seated in a first come first serve basis, so you can't actually request it ahead of time.  Well luckily for us, they had a table for six, perfectly shaded by an umbrella and seated us just in time for a fountain show.  This place was packed!  Even so early on a Saturday!  

We ordered a carafe of sangria for the table (lovely) and a St. Germain's cocktail carafe (also lovely, but good in smaller portions, so thank goodness there were six of us).  We also shared a goat cheese appetizer.  Not enough garlic bread comes with the order to sop up all the extra tomato sauce, but luckily their baguettes for the table are just as delicious and will be replenished if you ask.  The most impressive thing was the one of us was on a gluten-free diet, so not only did she get a special gluten-free menu, but they brought her gluten free bread!  Not bad.  The rest of us enjoyed our gluten-packed alternatives and the pickled carrots that came with it were something I'd never think to serve with bread and butter, but strangely worked.  

For the entrees 2 of us got steak, 2 got fish, one got veggies, and one got chicken.  The portions are very plentiful, the sauces well-balanced, and the food was all fresh and warm.  I opted for the filet au poivre.  We were informed the filets were so tender we could cut them with a butter knife...which may explain why we didn't get steak knives.  While I do love fork-tender meat, i also sometimes appreciate a steak knife, even if I ""don't need it"".  I hit a little gristle at one point that was very hard to work through with just my regular table knife, but at that point it wasn't worth it to ask for the steak knife.  Other than that, the steak tasted wonderful, and it was cooked perfectly rare for my tastes.  My second gripe, though, was with the ""fries"" that came with it.  I love that they're innovative and these aren't just typical steak fries, but unfortunately they didn't float my boat.  They were very much a cross between fries and chips.  I'm not a fan of potato chips unless they're flavored or I have dip for them.  But when I'm eating a nice filet, I especially am not in the mood for potato chips.  Le sigh.  They weren't committed enough to either the fry or the chip lineage, so I was left disappointed.  Now I imagine for the rest of the dining public, they'd probably love a chip\/fry hybrid.  Sadly, even a side of mayo to dip my fries in (it's so good!  and very belgian) didn't help much.  

We were too stuffed for dessert, sadly, but in all the dining experience was lovely, and the food really was delicious (minus my personal vendetta against the ""fries"").  I would gladly go back, because you get a nice meal for a much more reasonable price than at many of the other fancy Vegas gourmet restaurants with an unbeatable view.",Restaurant

Just came back from one AMAZING birthday trip in Las Vegas.  I was offered a free stay at Encore for a few days and could not pass this offer up.  Encore is very impressive and compliments the Wynn perfectly.

Rooms: Each room is a suite and I stayed in one of the mini-suites with a spectacular view of the Wynn and the Vegas strip.  The living room area is complete with a desk and sectional couch and ottoman.  The plasma is mounted on a base that swivels so you can watch TV in either the living room area or while laying in bed.  The windows are one of the room highlights stemming from the floor to the ceiling giving a massive view of Vegas (the higher the better I always say).  The curtains and shade are controlled remotely with 1-touch buttons next to the bed.

The bedroom is fantastic!  Complete with a super comfortable bed (I had a King size) and quality sheets, iPod radio dock, plasma TV, and a wall that is a giant mirror.  There is also a dresser and plenty of room for clothes.  The decor is modern and playful.  The closet is a nice size.  Rooms have a stocked mini-bar and extras...the extras are really tempting as they are all top notch items including the Fiji water. 

The bathroom is expected with 2 sinks, large mirror, tv monitor, bathtub (just a good size), and a large glass shower with option to use a handheld shower wand.  The toilet is also private with it's own door and telephone.  I'm big on using nice toilet paper and the Encore proves not to skimp on the small stuff.  The toiletries are the same as the Wynn and complete with Shampoo, Conditioner, Bodywash, shoe polish, mitt, cotton swabs, and more.  The towels are nice and large and also soft and there is a nice stock of them provided.  Complimentary bathrobes are included to use for your stay and with turn down service...slippers and a chocolate are left for you and your partner (if you have one.)

Restaurants: Ate at Sinatra and it was fantastic.  See separate YELP review.

Service: Encore literally provides service with a smile as each employee greeted me in the hallways with a smile.  I also used the phone to call front desk and to make dinner reservations and the staff was attentive and very helpful.

A big plus is that not only is the hotel gorgeous, but also the waitress staff.  Each seemed to be hand selected from a modeling agency. 

Amenities: I was able to check out the pool area and can not wait to come back in the summer.  It was a bit too cold still to take a dip, but the scenery was just beautiful.  The pool area is surrounded by a garden and each pool area was plush with nice seating (not the cheap stuff found at other hotels) and complimentary water and towels are provided.  Similar to the Wynn is the classy and chic feeling when at the pool, not like being at Rehab  at the Hard Rock or Mandalay Bay's pool area.  There is a gaming area as well and a European (21+) area that completes the poolside experience.

Gaming is also great at Encore as I was able to find the tables and slots that I normally play when at the Wynn with ease.  It sometimes was actually easier to get a seat in Encore.  I especially liked the blackjack tables because they had a nice wooden section in front where you could easily set  your chips on and your drink without the risk of catching the dirt that felt often accumulates underneath your fingernails when playing with the chips.  The games I found to be average price of most casinos.  While gaming I was able to order a variety of cocktails, beers, and even a hot chocolate at 4am that hit the spot nicely...and I highly recommend if you're trying to sober up.

Red Card is a great feature.  As my room card doubled as my player's card and works for both the Wynn and Encore.

Shopping is as expected amazing and similar to the Wynn with an Esplanade connecting the Encore to the Wynn.  I found that there were a few shops that if I had more cash to burn I would have loved to check out including Rock & Republic, Hermes, and Ensemble. 

I wasn't able to check out the fitness area or spa on this trip.

Entertainment: I was able to check out both the nightclub XS and the show Le Reve (again.).

XS was a little slow, but then again it was a Sunday night.  That still didn't stop good music from being played with a mix of the top hits.  The club itself is beautiful.  The dance floor opens to the outdoors and you can see the pool area.  Shapes of the female body were in gold behind the bars.  The drinks were pricey, but what do you expect from Vegas.  I must admit the club is a little smaller than I would have imagined and the go-go dancers weren't that great dancers.  

Le Reve for the 2nd time was just as good as the first.  A great show with a mini-story.  The acrobatics and stunts are just crazy.  The music and lights fit perfectly with the entire show.  The cast of characters leave you feeling like you just woke-up from an extraordinary dream.

I'll be back!",Shopping
SsS032OKo51oXvFuMTy_EQ,3zsO6B1p5L1sDUbIbZuaxw,WSmOu-JNHfVxvisIWAvL9Q,2014-02-20,"Special occasion tasting menus are a dime-a-dozen across the resort restaurants and fine dining establishments across the Phoenix metro area. I hesitate at taking the bait and buying into a $80+ per person dining experience that has in past experiences left me less than satisfied. The problem with the experience is not necessarily the restaurant itself, but the mass produced and sometimes simplified menu that caters to an audience that is typically much larger than the restaurant is accustomed to handle. Case in point: T. Cooks, an otherwise excellent restaurant, left a poor impression due to slow service and cold food back on Valentine's Day 2013.

So when I decided to book a $145 per person Valentine's Day dinner at Binkley's, I had my reservations that it might not hit the high expectations it had set from the hype I've heard about the restaurant and the chef. I thought to myself, my first experience there should probably be on an average night rather than a pre-fab menu experience. I cannot tell you how happy I am to report that I was wrong. It managed to pull off the second best dining experience I've had in Arizona and undoubtedly one of the top-ten meals I've ever had.

Starting with the service, the wait staff was attentive, friendly, and unbelievably accommodating. Another Phoenix area restaurant, Kai at the Wild Horse Sheraton, should be considered to have only marginally better service. To put it into perspective, Kai took the prestigious top honors of best service in the USA last year on Open Table. Binkleu's knocked the service out of the park by employing a huge staff to roll out the meals in perfect timing and included perks that are only part of the finer dining experiences - e.g. replace napkin upon using the restroom, new and highly customized silverware for each course.

Absolutely nothing bad can be said about the unbelievably creative and diverse meal that was served over the next two hours. While the tasting menu listed 6 courses, there ended up being a total of 19 individual rounds including appetizers, amuse-bouches, digestives, and palate cleansers. One element of surprise throughout the courses was the use of molecular gastronomy such as foams and liquid nitrogen, which was very well executed. 

From the six main courses, the highlights included a savory and not too overpowering black truffle winter vegetable soup, a delicate scallop on the half-shell with citrus flavored foam, and Wagyu beef prime rib with scalloped potatoes. Stand-out intermediary dishes included an intensely flavored micro-sized sloppy joe sandwich and a flash frozen vegetable medley. Each of the dishes were well sequenced - when a meal includes so many rounds, it is impressive when the meal can tell a story across the meats, vegetables and starches served.

Upon leaving the restaurant, I was satiated and not overstuffed. 19 rounds may seem like overkill, but consider that a majority of the dishes could be eaten in just a couple bites. It allowed a first time Binkley's diner such as myself to try a vast array of the offerings, exemplifying their culinary capabilities. The restaurant catered to every aspect a diner would want for a special occasion and more importantly (for them), I left longing to come back to try the food again.

I was extremely excited to surprise my wife and take her here for Valentine's Day for a couples massage.  She's been under a lot of stress and kicking butt lately working out getting in shape and a professional deep tissue massage was just what the doctor ordered.  This hubby was going to get bonus points this Valentine's Day.  I was really on my game this year, took the time and booked the reservation in early January, left my credit card on file to hold the appointment as it clearly states during booking and assured me was just to hold the reservation and no payment is at all required until the day of the appointment.  

Got a phone call one week later advising me that my original time of 2:45 wasn't available so they'd move it to the next available that day, 3:00 instead.  No problem!

Time goes on, fast forward to today, one week before my amazingly planned Valentine's Day excursion.  I get a phone call from a polite and pleasant employee informing me they're calling to collect payment for the booked appointment plus gratuity today one week before per policy.  I'm taken aback by this.  It clearly stated at time of reservation no prior deposit is required.  My conversation ends with the employee telling me she'd check with the owner and see if they could make an exception because I explained my funds are tight and I get paid the Friday before Valentine's weekend hence why the original arrangement was why I booked in the first place.   She agreed and said she'd call me back.  Phew! Crisis averted, or so I thought. 

An hour later she called informing me the owner refused to make an exception as this is policy and she would not deviate from said policy.  My heart was breaking, my perfectly planned finale to Valentine's Day weekend was crumbling. I pleaded with the girl to have the owner call me, stating I've never had such a problem with another establishment during any holiday booking.  She said she would call her one more time for me,  I thanked her and hung up.  Hopes crushed, praying the owner of this highly recommended establishment would have mercy on a thoughtful husband trying to make the day a little extra special.  

Hour later.  Same employee calls back one more hour later.  I can hear it in her voice,  I'm done for.  The owner refuses to personally call me nor make any exception to her policy which is stated no where on the website, nor during the booking process or even brought up when I was rescheduled one week after the appointment was made.  She proceeded to advise me the manager would allow me 24 hours to come up with the money or my appointment is cancelled.  I reiterated I had no extra money to front this cost until I get paid on the 12th.  She apologizes one last time and we hang up.  

Utterly disappointed.  How can the owner of such a renowned and popularly recommended salon have such a cold heart on such a beautiful love filled day?  Not to mention lack of customer service skills.  

Here I sit, one week before the day I had such big plans for.  Crushed and heart broken with disappointment with no chance of redemption because I was only notified one week before of this requirement.  You can't even book a nice restaurant a week out from Valentine's Day let alone a well deserved day of pampered massage for the woman I love the most and wanted nothing more than to reward her for being my biggest inspiration and love of my life.  

Sincerely, 

Heartbroken

*Edit to reply to business owners comment*

Well the business owner sure did get the last word in with her rude and condescending jab she took at the end of her reply by saying - ""I'm sorry you don't have the funds to prepay for the service..."".   Just wow.  My pay schedule nor personal finances shouldn't be any of your concern.  Your only concern should of been keeping this appointment originally and actually getting the $160 for the appointment and received a generous cash tip.  Not lashing out and personally bashing a potential paying customer.  You had every opportunity to make it right between my 3 conversations with your employee or even when I was called back about the reschedule a week after the original appointment was made.  Then I could of had ample time to make new arrangements.  In what world would anyone especially in this industry want to continue to patronize a business especially after parting ways on such bad grounds.  You have a cancellation policy that clearly states on your website that if you cancelled early you are still subject to a fee up to 100% still being charged.  I was fine with this. After this experience and it taking me to make the interaction public, she finally agreed to budge an inch and asking I remove this review.  I told her I would not because other honest hard working people need to be warned and I would never want anyone else to be in this situation with no chance for redemption this late in the game.",Beauty

Anyways I had a few questions I wanted to get the best possible plans and phones that fit my mom and i. 

First off I walked in the door and I immediately saw the associates that were working there face upset because I walked in so late and they were closing even though they try to hide it or facial expression set it all.

So I wasn't sure if I wanted to use my phone to give to my mom and just get one new phone. Or if I should just get two new phones. So I was discussing with him what is my discount or what I have to put down. Now keep in mind throughout this process he was getting phone calls on his Apple Watch and the Apple Watch I have one as well when I'm at work I make sure that it's on vibrate. He didn't bother and put in his watch on vibrate and he's working with customers all day I don't understand why he would have his watch on loud that's so rude when you're in the middle of a conversation with the customer that is trying to purchase.

So I asked him about if I can get a new phone will they be able to ship it to my mom for her birthday and of course I wanted to get a new phone for me as well as soon as I told him I wanted to get both phones he was like yeah sure he wasn't he wasn't trying to sell me a best plan he was just keeping me on my same plan he wasn't trying to sell me accessories when I told him I was interested in purchasing a new case.

I told him how much are there cases if they were expensive and his first reaction is yes they are pretty expensive instead of telling me they're expensive but you do get what you pay for that's exactly what I use at least at work.

No I was willing to pay because of course I want my mom to have a case it's her first iPhone I'm sure she's going to be super excited and I don't want her to break her phone and I want a new case for me because I don't want to break my phone I've always been very careful with my phone he didn't try to sell me a screen protector. Which of course you want and you need when you have a new phone you want absolutely nothing to happen to your phone at first of course right.

Also in the middle of all of this when we were talking this other associate asked him if I was going to pay cash or card why am I being rushed I'm actually trying to purchase exactly what I need and want so that made me very upset as well.

She was taking out the drawer and I soon as I said you know I'm probably going to pay both she put it back and she looked upset I'm trying to purchase I shouldn't be rushed I understand your closing she was also closing the whole store she only left the door a little open enough for me to get out in case of an emergency are you kidding me you're going to have me rush through that little opening to get out the door I understand you want to leave but that is extremely rude to close up the doors and everything when I'm still purchasing what if I didn't know that that's what I wanted why didn't they try to show me any other phone why didn't they try to tell me what do you want your phone for what do you look for in a phone that way they can't tell me what phone is best for me what if I'm not using exactly what I need and I want more and my phone doesn't give me that.

I can go on forever of all the bad things that happen I kept my cool I was nice to them they try to keep their cool of course I thought they were upset because it's time for them to leave but I can still tell their website anyways what got me more upset was who was rushing and for some reason it was saying error I couldn't sign the paperwork so I can tell he was like oh my god this is becoming more of a problem and after he redid it he was able to process it and I was able to have my phone.

What really got to me was that he didn't bother of taking out the form from the box he didn't turn it on with me he didn't help me set it up so and he didn't even give me a bag you don't even put all the things in a bag now I had my daughter with me my baby I had her in a car seat and she was sleeping you can you imagine me walking out in with a car seat in one hand and my phone in the other in the box don't you think I would've probably dropped it if I had the phone up paperwork in one hand and if I had my baby in in the other. 

I would've been extremely upset if I would've dropped my phone first of all second of all I did not appreciate that he didn't help me turn it on and set it up to make sure that my phone was working properly that was very rude 
 maybe I'll return the phone and just pay the restocking fee and go to Verizon more expensive but hey they have good network. I have so much more to say but I exceeded my limit.",Shopping

I am not even going to mention her by name because my purpose is not to destroy anything or anyone. There's a lot of positives here- professional stylists, it's open and airy, with windows! very important in my book to see what you look like in real life. They are animal lovers, have cool artwork, offer water, tea, and so on. I had been going to this salon over the past year and had pleasing results which is why I kept going back. 
So here's my PSA. Know what you want. Best thing to do would be to take along a picture of what you want. If you are not exactly sure and want the stylist to hook you up, don't be afraid to be vocal about what you do not like. Be vocal about what you do like. Stand your ground! It's your hair, your appearance, your hard earned money. You need not be bosom buds with your stylist, but there has to be a level of respect and understanding. They should be listening and not dictating. They can offer their opinion and suggestion, after all they are the professional, however YOU have the final say. Don't be afraid to ask questions!  
My appt. for this day, was for 11:30am, for a root and highlight touch up from a balayage I had gotten a year prior. Now before this visit, I had gone to Philip Pelusi's in MVL, 2 months prior for a root job. Why there? bc I needed it done asap. It was a Monday, when most salons in the 'burgh are closed, and they fit me in right after work. So at that visit, I asked about touching up my balayage highlights. The stylist explained, based on what I was looking for, was that all I needed were highlights on the top parts of my hair. She said I did not need a whole balayage. She explained clearly, and did not push this service on me, but rather gave me a quote and let me decide. THIS is how a professional stylist should be, respectful and responsible.  Why did I not return there? For one, they're in a mall with no windows. Second, as I'd been to MCN times before, I felt comfortable going there. 
Back to this fateful day. I had worked with this stylist before. She wasn't particularly warm and fuzzy, but she got the job done and that's all that mattered. Also, the one I wanted wasn't available for that time. I went in at 11:15am, and left almost 4 hours later! What, how!?! *deep breath*. Root touch up, easy enough. However, for the highlights, she said that because I had balayage done prior, that was what I HAD to have done again. She did not offer other options and foolish me did not ask. Not only is this way more expensive (look at my receipt), it's more time consuming. Instead of questioning this and refusing, I went along and kept my mouth shut even though this was NOT what I wanted.  While my master stylist (for those of you who don't know, they are the highest level of skill and cost the most) painted my long tresses, as part of light banter, I asked her recommendation of an Italian restaurant in the area. She quickly snipped that she could not talk and paint my hair at the same time. Uh... what?!! (head cocked to the side). You're a freakin master stylist and you can't talk and paint at the same time! At the least, tell me cordially, to give you a few minutes and after you're done painting, you can let me know. Now my spirits began sinking, as I was at the mercy of this brut stylist who was totally killing my beauty buzz. A half hour into my appt, another client sat down to my left. She happened to be getting the same exact treatments as me, by my stylist! Here we were two peas in a pod, getting simultaneous treatments! They had a long standing relationship, so the communication my stylist could not offer me, naturally did not apply to this woman. 
Once my highlights were on, I went to the side area to wait for the color to ""take"". So did my fellow pea. Difference was, I sat for hours because apparently reds take a very long time. Her, nope. She was done, got her hair blown out and styled, as I witnessed with my own eyes, and left to get on with her lovely day. I continued to painstakingly sit and wait. No idea where my stylist was most of the time. She offered water but should've given me a sandwich by that point. She didn't even wash out the color properly. I scratched off thick dye for days! I let her know how upset and I was about everything. 2 hr wait I understand, almost 4 with no blowout or styling?!! She offered no apology, but instead with a condescending smirk, said it was because of the service I requested. I informed her that she needs to let the customer know what to expect next time. I decided to leave with my hair wet. I could not bare to waste anymore precious time. Almost 4 hrs, wet hair- not $255 looking hair either, rudeness, $255 with tip (cuz I'm a sucker and can't not tip) sums up my harrowing experience. I've since fixed it myself at home, and been to PP for root jobs. Don't EVER put up with this! Read my PSA so this does not happen to you!!",Beauty
aAjbphRTHgBWv7H-7TCmIg,m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA,2010-01-22,"Just about the smartest thing Jamie W. and I did on our trip to Vegas this past weekend was rent a car. Last time, we were stuck on the Strip with either extravagantly expensive restaurants trademarked by brand name chefs or the $6.99 Prime Rib special. Nothing in between...nothing. Driving eight miles west of the Strip on Sahara Drive, you can find a stylish, low-key bistro in the middle of a strip mall. Yes, a strip mall. It's called Rosemary's, and there wasn't a sign of an obnoxious out-of-town gambler in the entire place. 

So here's the deal - $55 for a three-course prix fixe dinner, and you don't have to get two desserts. Instead, we went with three appetizers, two entrees and shared one dessert. Bonus points to Rosemary's for allowing such flexibility for the more peckish diners. It ended up being a whole lotta food, and most of it really good. We automatically got two big rolls on our bread plates, a Glazed White Chocolate Pecan and a Potato (see photo). Freshly baked and very tasty. We tried to save one for the dinner itself, but it was hard. Then we were given an amuse-bouche, a little square of Vegetable Bread Pudding with Shaved Chives that was a homey, heavenly pop in the mouth. 

The appetizers turned out to be a bit more hit-and-miss. The Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle with Garlic Cream Sauce and Saute of Wild Mushrooms (see photo) was impeccably presented but could have used more kick and texture to offset the excessive creaminess. The prawns in Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp were really succulent covered with the thick barbecue sauce, an unusual mix that mostly worked, but the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw was just a little too mayo-like to fully enjoy (see photo). I think a vinaigrette would have worked better. The winners among the appetizers had to be the Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with Emulsified Ravigote Sauce and Grandma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers (see photo) where the crunchiness of the boulette's outer crust went very well with the relish-like sauce. 

There was nothing wrong with the Arugula, Endive & Radicchio Salad (see photo) except for the fact that it was completely overshadowed by the showy appetizers. Our luck significantly improved with the two entrees - the Creole Grilled Prime Ribeye with Anson Mills Carolina Quick Grits, Crystal Red Onion Crust and Rosemary's Own Steak Sauce, and the Grilled Veal Tenderloin with Saute of Asparagus, Prosciutto & Maitake Mushrooms and Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce (see photos). Both were excellent - especially the way the meat was prepared, very tender and flavorful. Jamie and I were pretty full by this time (...we already had a to-go box ready for the leftover meat), but we couldn't leave without trying their Pecan Tart with Brown Sugar Ice Cream. If that wasn't enough, they left us a little plate of little cookies with the check (see photos). 

As good and abundant as the food was, it was really the attentive service that was most memorable about the meal. There seemed to be a trio of guys who were making sure we were served at exactly the right time and refilling our water glasses before they were empty. I kept imagining how much this experience would have cost if the place was in the Bellagio or the Wynn. So is it the Strip or a strip mall for you? Let your palate and pocketbook decide. 

FOOD - 4 stars...some dishes soared, a few flailed a bit in execution, but the meat was very well prepared 
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...quiet, dim lights in the main dining room...the typical romantic spot 
SERVICE - 5 stars...truly stellar 
TOTAL - 4 stars...a very solid four stars overall for Rosemary's",Restaurant
pBeJZlj_ofQyPAdFGlI9ng,iHcx-dJ4IO1LCTkUok3pqA,IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg,2016-03-05,"My husband and I had a little ""babymoon"" getaway to Vegas from San Diego. Prior to our trip, I told him that aside from a prenatal massage, all I wanted was a really good steak dinner.  We have passed this restaurant several times on previous Vegas trips, while walking to Firefly restaurant... and for whatever reason it has always caught my eye and I've wanted to try it out.

Before our weekend getaway, I checked out some Yelp reviews and booked a reservation on Open Table. When I booked our reservation there was a section for any notes and I made a comment that my husband and I were celebrating our babymoon.  When we arrived at dinner - there was a ""Congratulations"" card signed by the staff, which I thought was a really nice personal touch!

Here is a little description of what we had:

Cocktails - Well let's be honest, mine was a ""mocktail."" I am usually a big fan of mules and I really like the taste of ginger beer. So I was happy to see a version of that on their menu. Theirs is made with bourbon and had blackberries in it. I asked the waitress if the bartender could make an non-alcoholic version.... and it was perfection!!! On top of that, I was pleasantly surprised that I was only charged for the ginger beer, $4.50 I think. I have been to other restaurants where they will still charge the full cost of the cocktail, even though you are ordering it without alcohol. I thought this was a nice gesture. My husband ordered a beer, and if I remember correctly it was only $5.50. I think that's a steal at a nice restaurant.

Appetizer - We got the crab cakes and they were delicious! Large chunks of crab, just the way it should be.  The sauce on the plate was so good, that when we were done with the crab cakes, I used the bread to soak up that yummy sauce!

Entrée - My husband and I split the Tomahawk Rib Eye. This was $90 and definitely worth it, especially since it fed us both. We ordered it medium rare (anything else is just not right) and the majority of the meat was perfectly cooked. However there were a few small areas that were definitely more on the rare side. My husband did not mind eating those bites, and I didn't mind letting him. The steak was well seasoned and incredibly flavorful.  We both really enjoyed it!

Dessert - So we definitely didn't have room for dessert, but I considered getting something to take back to our hotel.  Well what do you know - the waitress comes by with a giant slice of their lemon cake... complimentary for our babymoon celebration.  I thought that was so awesome of them to acknowledge that and give us dessert! We ate a few bites at the restaurant, and boxed up the rest to bring back to the hotel.  The slice of cake was so big, that we ate it little by little over the course of the next 3 days! Good thing we had a fridge in our room.  The cake was moist (I hate that word - but it really was moist) and lemony without being super sweet or sour. It really was just right and a nice touch to compliment everything else I loved about our meal.

A few days after we got home from our trip to Vegas, we actually received a HAND WRITTEN THANK YOU NOTE from our server. WHAT????!!! Never in my dining experience has this ever happened. This is so above and beyond and truly is exceptional customer service.  I will definitely return in the future. Thank you Del Frisco's for a fantastic meal and incredible service!",Restaurant
dGDMujHr59tsSu1-UEUjxw,kn1ya_7VhGLx7iyl_sSc9w,ukCTLs6T8LY1eUBXiAlmCg,2015-01-24,"Honey?

Can we talk?

Listen. I have to tell you something.

I'm pregnant.

With Steak 44's food baby.

Yes, I know I'm a vegetarian.

It's so wrong, it's right.

I've been side-eyeing this place since it and its greedy valet situation has pretty much rocked this entire corner. I do, however, appreciate the rotating display of ridiculous vehicles parked pretentiously out front and how they help me win the wintertime game of Luxury Car Bingo In The Desert. I'm shallow. It's okay.

My dad and I, feeling brave, actually put on non-denim pants and real shoes and ventured to Steak 44. We went early, sans reservation, fearing the crowds. We easily got seated in a big booth, ensconced by dividers, shielded from the abutting bustling kitchen by a glass wall so sparkling clean you could barely confirm its existence. No glass surface in my home has ever been or will be so spotless. 

I started with the blood orange martini, probably the most I have ever paid for a single cocktail in my entire life. It was tasty in the way that Hawaiian Punch is tasty. I switched the to tart cherry martini, a wise move -- a complex and interesting drink with a heavy Luxardo cherry flavor. Meh or impressive, the martinis were big and accompanied by a hefty shaker filled with leftovers.

The hovering server, resplendent with some unidentifiable foreign accent, assured us the sides were enough to serve three to four. Because I was forgoing a pricey traditional entree, I picked a handful of veggie sides, while my dad opted for some medium rare 12 oz slab of moo. The roasted sweet potatoes and creamed spinach were okay, not knockouts, easily overshadowed by the glory of the creamed corn creme brûlée. I mean, incredible, amazing, custardy corn goodness. Just divine. The thin, curly, crispy onion strings were fluffy wisps of awesome, spilling over on the fancy white tablecloth. The veggie servings are massive and will easily feed me all weekend. My dad, who was all ready to hate the place, because it's all trendy and replaced his beloved Cork & Cleaver,  was forced to admit his steak was a perfectly cooked, excellent quality piece of meat. Out of principle, we split the butter cake, which was bizarre but good -- like a pound cake and cornbread had a baby. Not the high point of the meal, but good. 

The service was excellent and almost over the top until the credit card slip was signed; then he was MIA. That's lame. The place is not cheap; it's best reserved for a special occasion. It seems to be drawing a big crowd now, but is it sustainable given the number of pricey steakhouses in the valley? 

Time will tell; if 44 stays, I can eat my fill of corn creme brûlée whenever my whims see fit; if 44 goes, I get to park without circling the lot three times. All good; I win either way. Now, about that food baby -- it's due pretty soon.",Restaurant
G92Snmif6dDYugS2xhyg4A,qdYOYm9_lGe5U04xiKg25g,AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw,2017-06-01,"So, I'm from Georgia and am always looking for some good Southern cooking. We decided to try Okra last night based on the menu I found on their website. While the two menus differed greatly, the website menu did indicate the type and style of food offered, so it was not a biggie. 

We were greater haphazardly, as if we interrupting the server's evening (and it wasn't because they were in a rush...There were only 3 other small tables) This feeling continued throughout the entire evening. We sat outside and were the only ones out there. 

I ordered a tea and my husband, a beer. I was told it would be a while on the tea as they needed to brew it. It was 7pm in the evening. 

We ordered 2 starters - Peel and Eat Shrimp and Brussels with BBQ Lamb Necks. 

We enjoyed the patio, but it was quiet and we had a nice view of various staff taking smoke breaks. 

My tea was brought to me and it was Green tea, which I found interesting, especially considering it was a Southern restaurant. When our server sat it down, he said, ""If you want to sweeten it, don't use the raw sugar because it won't dissolve."" Luckily, I didn't, as there was no other real sugar alternatives. 

We received our starters and they looked delish. However, looks can be deceiving. The BBQ Lamb was DELICIOUS! It reminded me of a mix between burnt ends and pot roast. No gaminess at all. The Brussels were still raw and hard and actually tasted quite old. The shrimp sauce was very flavorful. The shrimp, however, were grossly overcooked or had been in the fridge for a day or two too long. They definitely were not freshly boiled, shocked, and put on ice. The bed of pickled veggies that the shrimp sat on were very good! Would love those on a bahm mi! 

We never were asked if we wanted to order entrées, so we asked if we could. We decided on the 2 piece fried chicken w\/ChowChow and a side of fried okra and I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak that came with Collards and butterbeans. When I ordered it, our server exclaimed, ""It's real steak!"" To which I laughed and said, ""I hope so..."" 

We waited for our entrées for an extremely long time (more than 30 min). Again, only 2 or 3 small tables other than ours who had been there when we arrived. There was no asking of if we wanted to order drinks or even being checked on by the server during this long time. 

A few minutes before our dinner arrived, music for the patio finally was turned on. It was MUCH needed, as we didn't even have the chatter of other patrons around. 

Dinner was served. Beautiful looking food again. The fried chicken was MASSIVE, like hanging off the plate. However, it was difficult to eat because it kept falling off the plate. Also, the crust all fell off in one large chunk when cut into. The meat was moist but lacked flavor, as did the crust. Salt and pepper would have helped a lot. The ChowChow was very good. The fried okra also needed salt (and we aren't ""salt"" people). 

My chicken fried steak was okay. The steak was well done, unfortunately, and, like the chicken, the crust all came off in one piece. The collards were undercooked, in my opinion... we boil them til they are soft in the South. They still had a bit of snap to them when you took a bite. The butterbeans were good but not memorable. The 'dirty sauce,' as it was called on the menu was broken and not very appealing. 

Dessert saved the evening. We ordered the canned biscuit doughnut. I was excited to see that, as my momma made those for us when we were younger. It did not disappoint! The Salted Caramel was not overly sweet and a true caramel. The biscuit was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Sooooooo good! 

I would go back to sit at the bar (in order to have better service) and just order a cocktail (although I didn't have one last night, the menu looked great and had some new takes on old classics) and doughnut.",Restaurant
UAScpQb-BsgiemQu0qAm2g,fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,tWasMHaS6ZD-xRhevpoqkw,2013-01-07,"This is my favorite theme restaurant everywhere- been to the Oahu (the most visited one), Maui, Anaheim, and San Francisco locations, and finally here! I was wondering when one of these would come to town- what took so long?! I'm a Landry Select Club member, so I can easily rack up more points for rewards (spend $250, get $25 in card credit). 

This one is located next to the Miracle Mile Shops, so here are your options: park at Valet at Todai or park at the Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops parking garage- enter the shopping center but exit out of the Todai side, and take the escalators or in our case, the elevator- we're parents now, so we're pushing a stroller. From here, a host will direct you. You will go through the store, into the elevator and up to the 3rd floor. From here, the host will seat you. It wasn't that busy, for lunch on a saturday, but then again, it's still new. 

New, clean, featuring memorabilia from the movie, seems a little smaller compared to the other locations, but the ambiance feature is this one is overlooking the popular Strip. There were some patrons outside, but it was too cold for us, plus, our two-month old baby. There were some tables  with chairs and booths (the booth was too small for us- we had a stroller). I can't comment on the bathrooms since I didn't leave the table. 

On to the food, the ""Run Across America Sampler""- hush puppies, artichoke dip and chips, spicy chicken, fried shrimp, and peel 'n eat shrimp, is our absolute favorite. The price was $15.99, slightly higher than the last time but maybe the prices have gone up since then (last year- Oahu). This one never disappoints- we always split it. My husband really loves the hush puppies, it's his favorite. Mine is probably the chicken. I got the strawberry speckled lemonade at $5.99- refills are 99 cents. (Similar to Red Robin's lemonade.) The Ice Cream Caramel Spice Cake was phenomenal! This was $8.99, but well worth it. We've had the other ones in the past-  the bread pudding, strawberry shortcake, and the cookie sundae, but this one is specific to Las Vegas- it's new. I'm pretty sure we are getting this dessert again. It seems like a seasonal flavor combination, but really, you could have this all-year round. The server was really nice, and the service was pretty good, too. We got to ask the server questions about the movie. The manager stopped by to see how we were doing. He even changed out my wobbly chair. 

My husband thinks that this takes away from when we go out of town, because we always include this place in our must-haves\/must-eats, but I really like that it is finally here, where we live. I hope that this place does well. Las Vegas and certain restaurants do not always mesh (except mexican restaurants seem to pop up when space opens up). And I intend on getting a shirt at some point, even though I live here. We were pretty stuffed and needed to walk around the mall to get a little more comfortable.",Restaurant

All my hair was completely blonde except for I had about an inch of dark brown at my roots. I told the hair stylist I wanted the ombre to be that exact dark brown and leave the bottom part of the ombre as is-BLONDE. now I do not feel the need to name the stylist as his customer service was great..very likeable and made my experience fun while he did my hair, it's just my hair did not come out the way I wanted at all. I had shown him pictures of what I wanted and it was pretty clear and I'm not a stylist but seemed pretty simple to me. My hairs already blonde doesn't seem like it should be so hard putting dark brown at the top of my hair. -_- well when he was done and turned my chair around I was shocked to see that he actually lightened my dark brown roots to light brown..and that was all he did he didn't even create any type of 2 color ombre he simply just lightened my roots that were grown out an inch,  and then he DARKENED MY BLONDE HAiR AT THE BOTTOM! ;0 now I will say this- my hair didn't look terrible or anything. It just wasn't even close to what I wanted and was in no way shape or form an ombre! But I am a very nice and passive person and after almost 2 hours of chatting it up with this hair stylist I just couldn't tell him how I wasn't happy with it because I felt bad for him!!! I myself..being a bartender know how it sucks ass when people don't like your work and complain and I just didn't wanna make him feel like his work sucked! He obviously has eyes and I know he knew it wasn't what I asked for and he even said a few times ""you sure you like it? I mean if you don't we can fix it?!"" And it was already 7:30 (past there closing time) and I had a bday dinner to go to which I was telling him about the entire time so of course I didn't wanna stay there in that chair any longer so I simply said ""no its fine. I like it really.."" I paid for it and tipped him 46 bucks just because I felt he was so nice :\/ went to work the next day (ima bartender) and all my fellow bartenders & the cocktail waitresses noticed my hair and and when I told them that I had asked for an ombre they were seriously in shock. Most of them have ombres and my hair didn't even come close to theirs! When I told them all about my experience and how I felt bad and couldn't tell him I wasn't happy with it, they all told me to just call and speak with a manager or owner there because it was nothing even close to an ombre and it's not right that I paid for it and still don't have the hair color I wanted. So I called right away and left a message with the receptionist and she said I would be receiving a call from the owner. shortly. Well a week went by and I never heard back from anyone so I called and the receptionist said she would have the owner call me right back. Well sure enough she got the owner on the phone and I spoke to her so nice and just explained what had happened and that the hairstylist had great customer service skills, but just didn't do to my hair what I had asked of him, and how I felt bad and paid for the service as well as tipped him $46 bucks. Instead of understanding me and giving me great customer service like her hairstylist at least, she argued with me and told me that that couldnt be true because if I had a problem with my hair I shouldve said so right then and there and not left until he fixed it and the fact that I tipped him even, shows that I was satisfied with it. :0 I had already explained to her that I am just so nice and because her stylist had an amazing personality I just didnt want to offend him and tell him his work sucked, and I definitely didnt want him to be the one to fix it since he couldnt get it right in the first place. According to her she ""would have to pay someone else to fix it now"" and that wasnt right either. She then said that I could come in and have it fixed but would be charged for the products being used. I told her I didnt feel it was right for me to pay more when I am the one being inconvenienced by all this, not only inconvenienced for possibly having to go down there again and waste more time to have them correct my hair and dye it the way i want, but also becuase it would have to be lightened (because he darkened my hair where he wasnt suppose to) and that causes damage to hair of course, and my hair was already thin and damaged. I told her that I had a problem with all this it just didnt seem right for me to be inconvenienced and have to still pay for the products used when my hair was gonna be damaged further because of him not getting it right the first time. She then insults me by saying that it seems i just dont wanna pay for the service of getting my hair done, and just want it for free. :0 at that point i realized I would never go back to a place that is run by someone so rude like that, that doesnt value each customer.",Beauty
J7H9QGB09lFrmbvH_ZL3Pw,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,aKFA85Miwb96A0IAS3mRgQ,2015-01-24,"Alright, lets get something out of the way.  Prior to visiting FEZ's new location, I read the early reviews.  Most of the early negative reviews centered around a poorly handled Facebook conflict with a customer.  I didn't see the Facebook snafu for myself, but I agree disabling Facebook comments is lame way to dodge the issue.  Still, my hope is that FEZ's social media guru (and their staff in general) learned from the incident.  For the sake of this Yelp review, I'm not taking that incident into account because I don't believe its fair for me to judge a business on something I didn't witness myself.

Now then, let's get down to business.  I've been to FEZ's old location a number of times and I was a fan of their food and of their staff.  When I heard that they were going to be taking over the vacated restaurant space on Central and Portland (formerly occupied by Portland's Wine Bar), I was ecstatic.  The location could not be more tailor made for a restaurant like FEZ.  Its an urban location that meshes perfectly with FEZ's urban vibe.  Plus its just a few miles south of the old location, making it accessible to their loyal customers and newly accessible to the Downtown work and happy hour crowd.  The only question for me was whether FEZ would retain the same charm and quality.  If my first visit is any indication, my answer is emphatically yes.

The remodel of this restaurant space has done wonders to liven up this corner of Central and Portland.  Both the interior and exterior space of the restaurant make  ample use of the space to pack in the patrons, while at the same time not making it feel overcrowded.  I came here with a friend on a Friday night around 5pm.  We were greeted and sat immediately (decided to sit inside tonight as it was a little chilly outside).  The menu is exactly as I remember it, with a wide kaleidoscope of items to choose from but most famously including their burgers and fries.  To ensure that the food was just as good I remembered, I went with an old standby.  A FEZ Burger and some of their famous cinnamon sweet potato fries.  Got a glass of red wine to go with it.  My friend got a half salad as she wasn't very hungry.

The food is just as good as I remember from their old location.  A medium burger topped with honey bbq sauce, pears (yes pears), feta, onions, and a garlic aioli.  A heavenly burger to be sure.  Their sweet potato fries are dusted with cinnamon and come with a deliciously savory sauce mixture on the side.  Again, great combination of flavors that almost made the fries taste like a dessert.

So now to the negative part of my review about FEZ that pretty much carries over from its old location.  The prices.  Total tab for a FEZ burger, fries, a glass of wine, tax and tip came to about $28.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't your normal burger and fries, but still not cheap.  The only other compliant I would register is that the interior acoustics are such that it can get really loud inside when its full.

Still, taken as a whole, FEZ is an excellent addition to the neighborhood and a terrific spot for happy hour after work.  Their old location garnered an average of about 4 stars on Yelp.  I think that's just right for their new location as well.  A bit pricey, but their food and their staff have always been top notch when I've been there.  And I love what they've done with the new space.  Whatever mistakes were made when they opened will hopefully guide them to continue improving towards a long successful tenure on Portland Street.",Restaurant
pblMCcqWhM9Gz4lFJNdSdA,wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,OY727FSxbdHIYSTBNrwygw,2017-05-17,"I've been taking my daughter's here for years, as they usually go to have their manicures\/pedicures done, and also their eyebrows waxed. BUT....after the way my oldest daughter and I were treated last Friday, there's absolutely no way anyone from my family will ever return. 

Last Friday, May 12, was my birthday and so my daughter wanted to treat me to a manicure. She was also going to get one and we thought it'd be a nice little mother daughter date. Sadly, things didn't go as planned. The place seemed more busy than it normally is, so we just took our seats (paying close attention to who was there before us, and to those who came after we did). We patiently waited and waited for about 30 minutes. Finally, some lady (the one who does the eyebrow waxing) began asking those who were seated, what they wanted done. My daughter stated that she and I both wanted manicures and then I told the lady that there was one lady ahead of us. For some reason, we seemed to have been overlooked, unacknowledged because she did not reply to us, and people who clearly came in after we arrived, were taken back to have work done. I let it go because maybe there was no waiting for what they were having done. Anyways, the lady before us went to have her nails done and my daughter and I continued to wait. We understood that sometimes it gets busy so we didn't mind waiting at all. After about 15 minutes my daughter went to the restroom while I remained seated to listen for one or both of us to be called. While I waited, the lady doing the eyebrow waxing asked me loudly and in a not-so-nice tone ""What you want?"" I couldn't understand what she was saying, though. I thought she was asking what my name was because they did have a sign-in sheet that no one working there seemed to be following. Anyways, she kept asking me what I thought was what's your name. I replied each time with my name. Honestly, she came off as angry and frustrated. Finally, someone told me that she was actually asking what I wanted. I told her my daughter and I signed in to have manicures done. She rudely told me to just go sit at number 3 chair, so I did. She did look very stressed out so I overlooked the attitude that I felt she had with me. Everyone has bad days and everyone gets stressed, I know I do so I just did as told and I even felt bad for her.

So, I'm seated at number three work station, and no one acknowledges me or says anything to me. That's okay, they're really busy. My daughter comes back from the restroom and stands by me because there were no available seats in the waiting area. After about 10 minutes of standing, my daughter tries to sit next to me in a vacant chair that was placed right next to mine and when she pulled it out to sit, the RUDE!!!!!!! guy doing a manicure at station two, snatched it from her and said, (in a disgusting tone) ""Don't sit here!!"" Sit over there!!!!!! "" I guess referring to where there were no seats for customers, customers who'd signed in, been looked over as if we were not there, spoken to indecently, and who had patiently waited for an hour just to celebrate my birthday and pay $60 plus tips. The way this person spoke to my 21 year old daughter was humiliating for her. She felt like a little child being scolded by mommy and daddy in front of at least 20 people. She tried to brush it off because she wanted to have that special moment with me, getting our nails done together on my birthday. But, I couldn't stay. There was no way I was going to allow her to give these people money for not even knowing basic customer service skills.

 We USED to be loyal customers to these people, but no more. We didn't say a word after the guy shamed my daughter. We just quietly walked out. What about our nails? Oh, no problem. We went to ""Nails Today"" on Tropicana and Eastern. Wow!!! What a difference in the way they treat their customers versus how we were treated at Super Nails. Nails Today asked my daughter to pull up a chair if she'd like to sit by me while I had my nails done and until someone could start on hers. They were warm and welcoming. We couldn't believe it. That day, they even stayed open way past closing time to finish everyone's manicures\/pedicures. They were very well deserving of a tip.

So, I think we've found a new place to go to for waxing, manicures, and pedicures. And by doing so, we'll at least get people who are welcoming, who smile, and who know basic customer etiquette.",Beauty

i must say, this is THE worst customer service experience i've ever endured.

we arrive, 2 minutes late for the movie (start time: rush hour, location of theatre: under construction). while waiting in line to buy tickets, the owner walks by. anxiously, we ask, ""has the movie started yet?"". his reply, ""the girl can help you when she's ready."" uhh, okay, not the question, but whatever.

for those of you who haven't been here, it's a tiny place, one show at a time.

the owner then starts chatting with another employee finishing her shift. he's casually checking his phone. so we're standing there, time ticking by, waiting to buy tickets and the OWNER is lollygagging about. there's two other parties in line behind us.  so we're standing there waiting.  and this older women with thick eyeglasses asks where something is located. the owner sighs, and condescendingly says, ""it's riiiight there, i told you already, the door with the...."".  i turn around to see the owner pantomiming to the poor old woman, belittling her.  my partner says, ""should we just leave?"".  as we're walking out, i hear the older woman attempt to defend herself and maintain her dignity, ""you know, there's no such thing as a stupid question.""

as we walk out the front door, i say over my shoulder, ""you just lost two customers!""

crisp, winter air slaps us in the face as we depart. i was about to start in to my partner about what kind of person speaks to a little old woman (or anyone at all for that matter) like that, when i hear him say, ""what was the problem?"". the owner followed us out.  wow, i thought, he cares!!! he's going to apologize! he's a real human! instead, this:

""go to the cinexplex on the queensway!""
""i don't need your support--f**k you!""
""now you've f**ked yourself! how else are you going to see this movie?!?""
""i don't go to your work and tell you how to do your job!""
""go f**k yourself""
as he's following us & we pass the UPS store, ""you gonna go into UPS & tell them how to do their jobs?""
""where do you work? you sit in a sh*tty cubicle all day?""

and on and on and on.

now keep in mind, we're walking down the street, he's following us this whole way screaming at us. the traffic stopped on bloor street is looking out their windows at the spectacle he's creating. a mother shoved her kids away from him. a woman took her earbuds out to hear his fuss. this went on for a full block!! 20 storefronts! it wasn't until i said to my partner, ""this guy is crazy. gimme your phone, i'm going to call 911."" that he finally stopped and cowardly, turned around.

we're people who try to support local, private, small. we're even willing to pay a bit more to do it. but who does this guy think he is--the pope? that we should be lucky to be allowed into his cinema? he doesn't want our business? fine, no problem! we did go to the queensway theatre.  and you know what? it was great! and by great, i mean we weren't accosted by anyone.

all i wanted was some attention.  some service.  sure, we were a couple (!) minutes late.  so what. so were the other people in line. (this wasn't helped by the sweet girl behind the counter moving at a snail's pace.)  if this guy, the owner, had time to chat, check his phone, in front of the very customers that are keeping the lights on in his business, it would be a great opportunity to...i don't know...serve them!

just because you have the means to buy a business doesn't mean you have any business running it. know your strengths. people, unfortunately, aren't one of his.  

sadly, the kingsway theatre is a shell of what it once was. today, the kingsway is a zombie. sure, it's physically there, but its dead. its guts, its heart, its spirit, all gone.  my guess is that the kingsway theatre isn't long for this world. which is sadly bittersweet. it's better that the landmark disappear altogether than the owner drag its name any deeper through the mud.  i shudder to think how many times in the grave poor, dizzy, Robert Home Smith rolled at the notion that his creation has devolved to this.

p.s. just found this interesting article about the owner & his previous stint at the humber cinema: ""...a mid-screening physical altercation with investor and partner..."". can't say i'm surprised.",Shopping
pMQDGC2f7UxNIM31ll-fUg,tr-rIH5UYweRJYj6QyKJJA,CHhrq03lsGLTMOaIzKpaqA,2013-12-27,"UPDATE: Because I always want to give Yelpers the full picture, good and bad. This morning, Dec 27, Tyler called from the North Olmsted store. He could not have been nicer or more professional -- even though he probably had an idea that he was calling someone who was thoroughly annoyed at this point (with Sears and with the customer service, though -- not with him).

At 7:48 he called me asking which parts I needed. At 8:06 I received an email telling me the parts had been ordered.

There, Sears, wasn't that simple? I'd even looked up the parts numbers for your convenience. It should not have taken: 

*15 days of effort on my part, complete with a Facebook, Twitter and Yelp campaign (and the help of many friends) 

*uncountable phone calls and emails to the store, to customer service and to the parts people, and finally 

*a phone call to my credit card company opening a dispute, because I did not receive what I ordered, so I was not ready to pay for it.

No -- apparently it took Tyler (and I can't emphasize enough: THANK YOU TYLER!) 18 minutes to resolve the problem. By contrast, I was on hold nearly an hour the first time I called their customer service number. Couldn't tell you how many hours I spent on coaxing Sears to send me what I ordered and was billed for. It was hours and hours. Many people said it was going to get done, and it never did (read below for the full details). And until this morning, I couldn't get anyone at Sears to do 18 minutes' worth of work making the situation right.

I don't want to try to count up the hours I spent trying to get Sears to send what I paid for.

And personally, I still wouldn't shop at Sears again. The big picture is too awful.

But Tyler did such a good job, I want to give him the big shout-out -- and even add a star, even though my total experience was still a one-star experience -- because he was very professional and he alone took 18 minutes to do the right thing.

The original description of what occurred appears below, for anyone deciding whether to purchase something from this store.


-----------------

Mid-November I ordered a KitchenAid double oven from Sears Outlet in North Olmsted, Ohio, and arranged for it to be shipped to my home in California.

December 12 it arrived with some parts missing. I phoned customer service and spoke to Wilma. She called the North Olmsted store and explained to someone named Chris which parts were missing. She then told me that Chris would order the parts the next day, December 13, and that I would receive an email when the parts were ordered.

December 19, I'd heard nothing. I called the North Olmsted store and asked for Chris. He said he had not ordered my parts because he was ""waiting to find out which parts"" I needed. (I don't know how he was intending to ""find out"" -- telepathy? -- because he'd already waited a week at this point and never contacted me.)

Regardless, I described to him which parts. He said he would order them December 19.

December 23, I'd still heard nothing. I called the North Olmsted store again. I summarized the problem. I was told by the man who answered the phone that everyone was ""too busy"" right now to speak with me, but that someone would call me ""right back"" -- no one ever called me back.

In the meantime, I called Sears Parts to verify whether any parts had been ordered. No. I then asked Sears Parts whether I could order the parts myself, since I have the part numbers in front of me. I was told no, the North Olmsted store had to order the parts.

So I'm at an impasse, you see, because I've contacted the North Olmsted store ***three times now*** with a clear explanation of what I needed, and no one there seems to have any intention of helping me -- or even returning a phone call at this point.

On the 24th and 26th I had a couple emails back and forth with SearsCares. I also had a phone call from a SearsCares person named Rashalyn on the 24th. She assured me SHE would contact the North Olmsted store and make sure the parts got ordered. The parts were going to be ordered ""for sure"" on the 24th or the 26th. She was going to send me an email with her contact info right after my call (she didn't) and she was going to send me an email as soon as the parts were ordered, the 26th at the latest. 

Well hey, it's the evening of the 26th. I'm hearing crickets. So far, no one has managed to spur the North Olmsted store to action.

By far it's been THE worst customer service experience of my life.

I would absolutely NOT recommend that anyone do business with this store, ever. I certainly will not. 

(Hey by the way Sears, I lived in the Cleveland area for 7 years and still know a lot of people there, all of whom will be warned not to make the same mistake I did.)",Shopping
LdGOeiNrMb0lP_YHt6oX3w,KBXHrMixzrurlcsB9DigRg,GiTv0gFXtYFQAzCXnPvepQ,2015-10-09,"In town to visit relatives. A short visit. Staying at the hotel park and decided to grab dinner before it was too late for my toddler son. He wasn't feeling well so instead of driving we took a walk on the nice evening to Chili's. Our hotel said it was right up the street and it was a short walk away. Arrived and promptly seated. The restaurant is a little less than half full around 6:45 pm on a Thursday evening. 

I haven't been to a Chili's in years so I had no idea to to expect but I know I probably won't be eating dinner inside with this toddler as it is close to his bedtime. The hostess is too kind and offers a high chair twice along with some crayons wrapped in a coloring book. She tells me about Chili's Rewards. My waiter is fast, a nice gentleman Sean, who greets my son first then me. I love when people acknowledge your kids. He asks me about beverages and if I want something for my son. He comes back with drinks and asks me about my menu options. At this time my son has taking a liken to to the paper wrapped silverware. And he is beating them on the table like drums. He loves all things musical and even plays the tambourine all day while at church. It isn't too loud and the venue as I said isn't crowded. 

As Sean is taking my menu items, another waiter, a black gentleman and I am black as well, comes up to the table with no salutations or greetings to either my son or I and just takes the silverware from my 23 month old sons hands and places them away from him on the center of the table. I proceed to order my food then ask for the manager. Because I was completely thrown off by what just happened in front of my face. 

1. You did not greet me.
2. You did not greet my son.
3. You took something out of my sons hand.
4. You did not ask me if you could approach my son or take something out of his hand. 
5. You did not say a word to me. No comment that my son was disturbing other guests. 
6. In order to place the utensils on the table in front of you had to reach over me as I was ordering my food. 
7. You walked away as if nothing happened. 
8. You offered no apology after I spoke to 2 managers requesting that you apologize. 
9. You proceeded to avoid any contact with me. Not a real man. Definitely not the man who boldly walked over to take something out of my sons hands. 

The manager comped my meal. And apologized on behalf of the server, Marcus, who was both rude and disrespectful. The whole ordeal could have been avoided if Marcus would have said something to me, the parent, instead of reprimanding my child as if it was his own by avoiding conversation with me and taking the liberty to remove something out of his hand again without my consent. 

He essentially touched my child and I doubt if someone could touch your child unless it was life threatening with you present without you having something to say. I waited as my food was prepared and Marcus so boldly avoided me and any opportunity to offer an apology. I found it interesting that the security guard made his way over to my area to stand and wait as well. He stared into my face multiple times and watched me like a hawk. Could a 5'5 woman with a toddler so scare an establishment that security has to be called over because they are afraid I'm going to approach Marcus and what, demand the apology that I so rightly deserved? When I asked the guard if there was a problem because I hadn't seen him the entire time of my visit until my request for an apology. He stated he worked here and that is no issue. No, it was a case of discrimination, disrespect and negligence that they didn't want to hold Marcus accountable for. The managers did apologize but I told them it should come from Marcus. They said they could ask him but they couldn't make it as they would deal with him individually. The truth is they probably never said a word.

The combo fajita and chicken tender platter was actually good. While I wouldn't patron such a disgusting establishment that allows certain servers to do whatever they want to do to customers and their children for that matter without demanding that a real man or woman apologize for their short coming or mistakes, you are free to do so. I guess this behavior is tolerated in the South. Not, coming from where I'm from. You don't ever disrespect a parent or a child, period. You are not his dad or parent, who was down the street.  And a security guard doesn't scare me. I did nothing wrong. There goes a place perpetuating stereotypes. I won't be bullied.

I hope you find this review helpful in determining the most welcoming establishments to eat as a family while in Charlotte. And lord help you if you take a tired toddler who makes too much noise. The servers will take it into their own hands to remove anything that disturbs others without talking to you. That's the last time I visit a Chilis. And I have already written Corporate.",Restaurant
QEGHbaqPVIzUtiJkXC75FQ,gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,2013-09-05,"Sweets Raku is the brainchild of Mitsuo Endo of the Abriya Raku fame (a 3-time James Beard Award nominee). The concept of this restaurant is a dessert bar, where you come in, order off a prefix menu, or order the desserts à la carte. Being a dessert bar, you will be served desserts only (but I've heard that they also have a cheese plate). After hearing some interesting comments about this dessert bar, I went with a buddy after my SnowFlake Shavery fix to get some dessert.

SR is located in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones. It actually sits across the same building complex as Raku. Walking inside, you'll notice an amazing display of bottles of water and other refreshments built into a see-through wall. The clean, modern, and white interior give you a sense that the people who created this restaurant really wanted to give you an unforgettable experience. There is an open kitchen, and around it sits a bar with around 15 seats where you can watch all the desserts being made right in front of your eyes! There are also tables, but if you have the opportunity, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.

The pastry chef is Mio who is in charge of the kitchen. She's been a pastry chef for over a decade in Japan, but you would never guess due to her youthful appearance. The server dropped off a menu that was rolled up in a sugar ribbon ring. After ordering our drinks and the prix fix menu, we waited for Mio to start. The menu is also edible, and I thought that was a real neat and fun idea to be able to eat a menu!  It didn't have a taste at all, which is good because I would have gagged if it tasted like paper. The server then brought us our drinks.

- Americano coffee: They use the Illy brand coffee, and it was bold and well made.

The Amuse\/First course came up first:

- Strawberry and Mint: A strawberry sorbet with mint jelly, with a fresh sprig of micromint. The strawberry sorbet had a nice strawberry flavor. The texture was sort of weird for me, it wasn't icy... but I guess it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.  It's hard to describe. On the other hand, the texture of the mint jelly was well done, but I couldn't really taste the mint flavor that much.

The main entrees then arrived:

- Mt. Fuji: This was a play on the classic French dessert, the Mont Blanc. This was my favorite dessert of the night. The chestnut cream was amazingly light and had a smooth chestnut flavor. The cake was moist, and the chestnut glace complimented the whole dish. The presentation was also pretty cool.

- Apollo: Chocolate and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake, Earl grey tea ice cream, raspberry meringue, chocolate bases, and raspberry sauce. I thought the mousse's were all well made and so was the chocolate cake. The chocolate squares around the plate and the Earl Grey Tea ice cream were my favorite part of the dish. The ice cream tasted exceptionally well with the pink peppercorns that were ground on top. I thought the meringue and raspberry sauce were O.K. This was my least favorite dessert, I thought, flavor wise... it was just too safe.

The petit fours\/Last Courses arrived:

- Parmesan cheesecake with oranges: I loved the concept of this dish. It is like eating two different courses in one dish. By itself, the cheesecake is very savory, and I thought that this would make a nice appetizer on a restaurant menu. But then, after eating the cheesecake together with the oranges, it complimented the savoriness of the cheesecake perfectly, and it became a dessert again! I found this to be absolutely fascinating.

- Chocolate Fondant with marshmallows: The warm chocolate molten cake was well executed with a cakey outer shell, and a warm molten interior. It was a well balanced cake. My favorite accompaniment of the night had to go to the lemon marshmallows. They had a bright, strong,  lemon flavor, and they tasted just like a lemon curd! I thought the raspberry marshmallows were lacking in raspberry flavor, but the texture was good.

The service throughout the night was top notch. The server knew when we needed drinks refilled, and cleared our plates at the right time. She was super friendly and knowledgeable and engaged with us enough, but not overly smothering.

Dining at Sweets Raku brought an old smile to my face. It brought me back to those pre-""Great Recession"" days. I remembered when the properties on the Strip were in competition with each other... not money-wise like they are now...but quality wise. Back then, F&B programs were trying to think of ways to create unforgettable experiences to their guests. Now, it's all about the bottom line, which is why we only see now burger joints, bars, and steak houses popping up, with inconsistent service everywhere. There are some flubs in this place, but you can find flaws at Raku, Joel Robuchon, The French Laundry, etc. But, this place deserves 5 stars, because.. it's the thought that counts. 

Kudos to Chef Endo and Chef Mio, true artisans of their profession!!!",Restaurant

I MUST be getting older, because the words ""day spas"", ""relaxing"", and ""tea rooms"" are more music to my ears than ""day clubs"" and ""bottle service"" haha!

As a treat to myself for my birthday, I was researching for the perfect day spa to set my foot in and enjoy maximum zen.  I decided to go with Caesar's Palace since they had better reviews of their facility and had a more affordable couple's massage package than other hotels.  

I booked my spa treatment and was given a great recommendation by the concierge- the Kama Sutra with Shirodhara for $450.  This couple's massage is actually not listed in their website, so I am glad I called.  I did ask for a breakdown and confirmation of the price and was promised a couple of times via email that I would receive the information, but ended up receiving the details AFTER I had already received my spa treatment :(

QUA SPA (4 STARS):
Qua is located by the Augustus towers.  Take the elevators right behind the Starbucks.  You are greeted by friendly staff members who check you in and send you on your way.  Knowing that I wanted to spend the whole day here, Andrew D. and I woke up early to get a workout in at their gym before our massage.  

There are separate areas for the men and women, so Andrew D. and I went our own separate ways while dropping off our bags in the locker room.  I got a great tour of the facility by Michelle who let me know all the amenities that were available to me during my stay.  She saw that my bag was heavy and took it while she gave me the tour and gave me a headband since she noticed I didn't have one when I went to the gym. Thank you Michelle!

Surprisingly though, Andrew D. did not receive the same stellar treatment.  He told the men's front desk that it was his first time there and they only showed him to his locker.  I had to text him occasionally to make sure he was aware of the different amenities he had.

Caesar's palace fitness center is amazing! They have so many different machines available.  The attendants saw that I didn't have any headphones and gave me one to enjoy during my workout!  There are bananas, apples, towels, and water bottles a plenty in the front.  Their machines feel clean and each one comes with a clean towel ready for your use!

After the gym, I took a quick shower, dried my hair, and perused their snack bar!  Look to the bottom of the snack bar counter because there is a fridge stocked with cold canned juices and waters galore.  Pretzels, bananas, and apples are also available for you there.  There is hot tea if that tickles your fancy.  I was reading my Games of Thrones book in the tea lounge and was so relaxed I almost dozed off a couple of times.

I tried out the jacuzzi, herbal steam room, and sauna.  Each one was glorious!! I could stayed in there for forever!  Plus, I love that Qua is not stingy with their waters or towels.  They have them in abundance around the facility!

I was a little sad that the Arctic room was out of order and that I didn't get to use the room with the 3 jacuzzis since there were EMTs that were there.  But, hopefully they will be available the next time I go!

Qua showers are amazing!! They have the rain showerheads which are ALWAYS lovely!  My showers here were extra long because of how relaxing it made me feel.  I loved that there was a lock to the shower doors and you could hang your robe in a little section so it wouldn't get wet.  I am also glad I asked for razors and shaving cream since I had an event to go to that night!  They really do have everything imaginable here!  Hairdryer, hair curler, mouth wash, toothbrush, brushes, lotion, tampons, showercaps! You name it, they got it!

For a more zen vibe, I would probably recommend sitting in the Lanconium room.  The chairs are heated and it is way more quiet than the spa.  There are sounds of hairdryers, television, dryers, chatter around the spa so I loved escaping into the lanconium for peace!!

THE MASSAGE (5 STARS)
If you are looking for a great couple's massage, look no further than the Kama Sutra with Shirodhara ($450) massage.  You are probably thinking, god damn, $450?  But! Trust me, it is really worth it!!  

The treatment comes with the following:
- Botanical oil poured onto your third eye chakra.
- Full body exfoliation with a champagne seed body scrub.
- Private in-room shower after the full body exfoliation.
- Massage afterwards with oils.

The whole treatment for you both is 80 minutes and you each will have a massage therapist working on you both.  Walking into the room was breathtaking!  There were 2 massage tables with the windows wide open with a beautiful view.  We did ask for the blinds to be closed for our treatment so that we could both enjoy the zen-ness of the moment AND also because we were both asked to strip down naked for the massage!  The aroma of the oils and thorough massage of every part of my body was pure HEAVEN!! I would definitely recommend this for any couple who want a treat!!",Beauty
zZzv6zSrfpMOxo5BfAu0bA,bfCyqpNNOL0tO5TmlHOxAQ,UT9KnZ288uwsz4pxzUVzIQ,2016-09-26,"This is my update about their 1960s-themed 55th birthday bash I attended yesterday, that I mentioned I'd write about.   Chris Town Mall turned 55 actually on August 24, so I imagine they planned the celebration for this month because it's cooler to get around.  I appreciate that- how thoughtful ;)

First, I rarely accept invites (especially in cheap Arizona), unless I know the folks who are throwing a party or event know what they're doing and make it my worthwhile off my busy schedule to attend.  With that said, I made an exception to go to Christown Spectrum's birthday celebration that was worthy to go to if you were located\/lived around the area, and were part of history.  The 'party planners' (who dressed in 1960s regalia) were a bit rushy, especially. the petite blond when I asked if I could take a photo of her outfit but she was unnecessarily in a mad rush to get the cakes out when i'ts a bit early with plenty of time.  Must be from the influence of being in the ghetto environment.  While you have a party, relax and enjoy your fun and not run around with your head cut off.  I eventually got a shot of her with 2 other planners.  They had store-bought refrigerated sheet cakes (from nearby Costco?) (choice of white or chocolate- I had a very small slice of each) on non-descript styrofoam plate with a plastic fork.  There were no tables or chairs so you'd end up standing or finding a table at front of Costco.  No drinks either.  There weren't enough cakes (looks like they only brought out a total of 6?), so if you weren't there earlier, you didn't get your slice.  The free photo op with a ""Love\/Peace"" backdrop was a nice thought, and the guy was very nice and polite- was not overwhelmed.  I loved the hand-made 1960s fashion display throughout the mall and out front, where the mannequins were provided by JCPenney.  I especially loved the enlarged photo wall displays located at two ends of the mall featuring the mall of yesterday- so nicely done, like the photos\/titles\/descriptions were 'painted' on.  Each booth had vendors promoting their themed trade: balloon twister who made animal shapes (she was so talkative & slow that there was a long line waiting to take home her animal-shaped balloons), flower-power artists painting on faces, flower-power sticker tattoos on faces, hula hoop contest, psychedelic pixel painting, arts\/crafts.  The band, The Rove, played '60s songs.  I like that they had a band instead of a DJ.  There were 2 VW Love Bugs, one green, the other blue on display inside.  There was a VW Bus parked out front where you could look inside.  There were getaway prizes where you could sign up for.  In concluding, it was hard to meander about in the mall with all these welfare ghettos.  The decade was def big fun- I was 5 in 1969 but I remember well!  Happy 55th Chris Town Mall, and may you live another 55.  Thanks for the fun :)

From their official newsletter http:\/\/www.co-opweb.com\/emails\/christown\/newsletters\/july-2016\/consumer-index.html:

""Fifty-Five years ago, in 1961, Christown Spectrum Shopping Center, as it is called today, was opened with enormous fanfare! At the time, the greater Phoenix area had never seen a shopping center quite like Chris-Town Mall, as it was called then. The exterior architecture looked much as it does today but the interior had various design elements that would be considered eccentric in today's world. There was a Court of Flowers garden area filled with exotic plants and flowers, a Court of Fountains area had an array of fountains and artwork created by a famous artist of the time. The third area, the Court of Birds, housed live birds in colorful pop art hanging birdcages throughout the courtyard, all accented with lighting fixtures designed by the famous designer, George Nelson.

The era when Christown opened was also the time for many societal and cultural changes -hippies, bell bottom pants, the Beatles, psychedelic colors and flower power designs, VW Bugs and Buses, Barbie, the Hula Hoop, and more. Many became enormous crazes and several thrive to this day!

Over the last 55 years, while many things have changed - socio-economic times have gone up and down, retailers and restaurants have come and gone, one thing remains a constant, Christown Spectrum is a Phoenix shopping icon and continues to be a popular family shopping center.

PuhEMbnzaEanEEb426AJCA,iDeRoR1Rw4vstaOptSb7qg,8auRU0T7go0oBszo_DDOPA,2011-08-23,"I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation, so I decided to stop in to Star Nails in Bellevue. I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.

The salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.

Nancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.

The pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.

Nancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.

This is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.
END TMI

Even though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.

The manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.

The polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.

Again, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.

They also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.",Beauty
D19lCYd6Sv7IfPHWEmQghA,qDs3nc0Aa86Tz4A2apzbqw,Q0HAhn2Pi2afILbtiPvlIQ,2013-04-02,"I have never been to the Ahwatukee Country Club before March 31, 2013, Easter Sunday.  I guess I set my expectations too high.  When we arrived, there where many empty tables (that should have been our first clue).  We were escorted to our table by the bar in the room furthest away from the buffet.  There were some dirt marks on the tableclothes but it looked like they were stained.  Maybe they should have reconsidered using those ones.  We sat for a few minutes before our server told us she would be right with us.  About 4 minutes or so later she came over to take our drinnk order.  There were 5 of us.  She got 4 drink orders and walked away.  We had to call her back when she said she hadn't realized she didn't get my order.  We also had to ask her if it was okay to go to the buffet.  I think she was the only server working as I did not see any one else in that capacity.  When we walked over to the buffet table, there were no plates.  SERIOUSLY, NO PLATES!  There were two gentlemen in front of us that told us the person carving went to go get plates.  He brought about 10 which was ok for that moment.  The first chafing dish contained the eggs and potatoes.  The eggs loooked like they were overcooked and sitting there for a while.  The ""fresh cut potatoes"" were actually the best tasting item they had available.  The next chafing dish had bacon and sausage.  I prefer my bacon well done and none of it looked like it was cook that way.  The sausage looked greasy.  Next was the petite assorted quiche.  There was no sign to tell me what kind of quiche were there and they looked like they bought them from a bulk store instead of being freshly made. Chicken Marsala was next.  There were a few pieces left.  I was putting a lot of hope in this dish as it is one of my favorites.  It was way too salty.  This leads me to think that it was pre-made as well as a good chef would taste the food that they make to insure proper seasoning.  Then we had a chafing dish with a spoonful of mashed potatoes and some asparagus spears.  I had to locate the carving person to let him know we needed more vegatables.  Thank goodness he asked what else was needed, oh wait, I think someone from the staff should have been checking to make sure there was enough food available for the restaurant guests. Now we come to the salad.  It was so picked over and visually unappealing, I decided to pass.  However, the rolls they had were very good.  Since the carver person was busy refilling the chafing dishes, we had to get the ham and beef ourselves.  Please see the picture that I have uploaded.  NO BEEF and a small chunk of ham and a big chunk of fat.   So we returned to our table and picked at our food.  Our drinks were served, however the server was unaware of how to make a Shirley Temple.  That would be okay, but just ask.  I would rather be asked then served the wrong drink.  We had to return the drinks and tell her how to make them.  So we finish our lackluster meal and go to the ""dessert station.""  Please see the picture.  Picked over red velvet cake, some chocolate cake, some pastries, a tiny bit of cheesecake, bite size eclairs with melty chocolate and sticking together in the center of a plate surrounded by not very good cinnamon rolls.  The Pièce de résistance was the peach pie in the silver tin.  Okay, so I was looking for a less expensive meal for Easter dinner for five people.  It ended up costing $160 and I was not only upset about what we paid but I was embarassed that I made the suggestion to go there.  This may be an okay place for a drink and a sandwich after a round of golf but they do not know how to do brunch.  I don't htink I would even consider them for any function after our experience there.",Shopping
bN0PWgwt1H-Wx3kSQgqOEg,lX84alrS89AFMWcRtyu4Ow,V4yV2MCLbvdEFT_ggi35Xg,2013-01-13,"Five stars for Tiffany's gorgeous selection of jewelry, but if I could give negative starts for the service I would. 

Let me start by saying that when you purchase anything from Tiffany's, it is supposed to be an exiting and memorable experience. Not only are you spending a decent amount of money, but generally the things you purchase from Tiffany's are for those close to you, and have a lot of meaning. 

My Tiffany's experience at this location was memorable, no doubt, but not in the heartwarming and sentimental way that it is expected. 

Firstly, I am a young college student, and I work in management for every penny I make, and trust me, money isn't easy to come by. Upon entering the store, I was not greeted, and had to approach a sales lady to get her attention. Maybe because I look younger, and therefore couldn't theoretically afford to shop at Tiffany's is an explanation for why I was neglected, but nevertheless it is unacceptable as I was perfectly willing to spend money.

I came in knowing exactly what I wanted to buy, a pair of cufflinks for my boyfriend as a holiday present, politely asked the sales woman if she had them, and her immediate answer was ""Nope!"" Not only is that rude, but it is very standoffish. So I proceeded to ask her if she had any similar to the style that I wanted and she said yes, pointed into the general direction, and said ""over there."" I had to ask her a few times where she was pointing, and finally she clarified. So as I was looking over their smallish selection of cufflinks, she shouted from across the store, ""oh wait I found them""
Alright. 

So I took a look at them, and told her I want to purchase them, and handed her my debit card. 

For a purchase of less than $500 there is no way why my debit card wouldn't be accepted at tiffanys. It had plenty of funds and I didn't go over any daily limits, but somehow, she said she couldn't accept my card, and that ""you need to go get cash now from the ATM in order to purchase these"" 

A little frustrated, I said okay and proceeded to go to the ATM and withdraw money, which came out all in tens. Not my fault, not her fault. 

Then, surprisingly as I walked into the store, the woman was accompanied by her security staff, speaking of me, and saying that she 'needs to be protected'. Excuse me?! I am a young college student  wearing a white dress, high heels, and carrying several other bags in my hand. What on earth do you think I'm going to do to your sales associated that will whatsoever put her in danger? Absolutely unacceptable. But because I'd already gotten my money from the ATM, I decided to purchase the cufflinks anyway. Otherwise I would have left at this point. 

Seemingly annoyed by the fact that I had to pay in all tens, regardless of the fact that I previously offered her my card, she rolled her eyes and proceeded to ring me up. She shoved my bag to me, and then turned her back to me once I had my gift. No thank you, no goodbye, nothing. 

Upon leaving the mall, I noticed I didn't have a receipt. I walked all the way back to Tiffany's, only to be confronted by security again. ""Do you have a question?"" I got my receipt after the sales lady said ""oh sorry, I wasn't thinking about you, here"" and left. 

Needless to say, I contacted the store manager directly after leaving.  

If you are a younger person looking to buy a little something special for a loved one, I would advise to go to another Tiffany's location or purchase online. Otherwise, if you look like an affluent, typical Scottsdale resident. You should be fine. 


I will NEVER return to this Tiffany's location. Ever.",Shopping
zfgkOXMlKGgY8X7pUFWJ8A,NsG7JOiQ6XoWkuzdBj_V4w,5LtZLznMWTNsciWBU3zg2g,2017-09-24,"So I've been loyal to this salon since I started going there about a year ago. Every 6 weeks like clockwork.(drop $200 every time) I went in for my initial consultation with Kelly (no longer works there) She was amazing with my very fine (but healthy) platinum blonde hair. At this point I was absolutely in love with Studio Raw. She was very kind with my hair. Knew what products worked best on me and made a point not to damage my hair. That took precedence over everything. I initially came in with light golden blonde hair and had wanted to kick it into the ash\/white\/silver range. She got me to my goal and was wonderful at my cuts as well every other appointment or so. I even loved how she asked me how I wanted my hair styled. I'd walk out with gorgeous Barbie doll curls.  Sadly she moved away in February and I was left scrambling for someone new who could be equally good. 

Here's where everything goes wrong. As per her recommendation (my old stylist) I started seeing Nicole. HUGE MISTAKE. If you have bleach blonde hair this girl will fry you. I've had a handful of appointments with her and the health of my hair has gone downhill terribly. After my second to last appointment I started to really have enough. I already didn't like that she was extremely rough with my hair. Tugging and pulling with a barrel brush,  dropping her utensils everywhere. This girl is a bit all over the shop. My haircut that time was AWFUL. How do you screw up a trim on long straight hair? When I came home I had to fix it myself it was completely crooked on one side. I don't know what the hell she was doing. THEN I start to notice breakage on my lower hairline in the back. I take such good care of my hair knowing what it goes through. Rarely does it even face heat. The products I use are nothing but the best. I do Olaplex treatments regularly and treat it like a baby. 

So now comes the very last appointment (last Saturday) I knew my scalp would burn that day because well it always does with Nicole. Well on this particular day after nearly an hour and a scalp on fire I ask her ""what volume developer are you using?"" 30.....30 freaking volume on dirty blonde roots! Yes you read that right. For nearly an hour! I wanted to scream. All I could do was hold it together until I got home. Later that night I wake up and my entire face is swollen. She BURNED me. Ruined my entire weekend and following week. I was very close to an ER visit if it didn't go down. Took 3 days! And since I have spent tireless hours doing treatments after treatments to save my hair. I've managed to start the recovery but have suffered lots of breakage. 

First I contacted Nicole herself and she pretended to care for maybe a day. After she knew she burned me she tries to put it on me. She KNOWS it was her fault. 30 volume!? I had THE HEALTHIEST HAIR. As soon as I mention my old stylist and how she did my hair *crickets Never heard from her again. 

Next I contacted the owner who I really like and respect. Nothing. 2 grand I've spent there. My hair is destroyed.

Charlatan owner who hides behind fund raisers and completely juvenile online image. That stuff is well and good but you run a garbage operation. Your customers need to be a priority. You can talk about weed with clients, which is super professional btw, and give phony ""charm"" compliments but when it comes to legit customer complaints you can't be bothered beyond petulant gaslighting.",Beauty
P_Nm6Q4AjgvkXmZZwCzd0g,qygModUyyK_Hi_b1uxSLFA,dJuxA0paONof3QiMAN8d7Q,2009-01-03,"All my life I wanted to be able to wear long, dangly earrings. 

Seeing as how I spent most of that life as a boy, however, I wasn't ready to realize this dream until, like,  yesterday, when I came into Halo to get my lobes done.

Admittedly, this wasn't my first trip to Halo. I came here a couple days earlier with Misty S so she could get her ears stretched. I was supposed to get mine pierced that day too, but I froze up once I realized that I wasn't just going to be able to ""flash my ID"" to them and let that be that. They hold onto your ID until after you get the piercing done, which in the back of my paranoid and irrational mind meant that it gave them plenty of time to decide they want to ""reserve their right to refuse service"".

Yes, I know I'm silly. And as long as The Man keeps using his bureaucracy and red tape to keep me down, the silliness shall continue non-stop. So don't judge me.

\/self-pitying rant

I sulked for a couple days, pondering. Eventually I came to the realization that it was either this or Claire's, and I was not allowed to let this simple procedure that I had romanticized into a sort of rite of passage be performed by an unqualified teenage girl with a piercing gun. 

So I inevitably returned with Misty S, who had by this time decided she wanted to get her brow done. I know, how romantic, right?

Now that I wasn't trying to ignore the screaming voice inside my head, I noticed that I quite dig the feel of Halo. The staff is uber-friendly in a ""gabba gabba one of us one of us"" kind of way and if you think that's a Ramones reference I will throw my fucking shoe at you.

I found it really remarkable that the guy behind the counter, who had no visible piercings to the naked eye, knew so much about piercing himself.

He was actually able to talk Misty S out of something (she wanted a ring for her brow, but he presented a convincing argument as to why a barbell would be safer and easier to handle to start out with). Fuck. Even I can't talk her out of anything. Retrospectively, it might help if I actually stick with my ""spitefully holding out on sex"" act, but I can never keep it up for long. 

I know. I know.

Our piercer was Ana, who we both absolutely fell in love with. Tall, tattooed (supposedly everywhere but her face and feet) and foul-mouthed, she had that perfect mixture of intimidating dominatrix and down-to-earth gal pal that really put us at ease over this whole ""getting metal shoved through our faces while the other watched"" bit, which I hate to admit was kind've erotic in its own way.

Ana, while making small talk, went into a rant about how piercing externalizes something that we feel on the inside, and that we can't allow ourselves to be limited by what the world sees us as, and after I had a good laugh much to her confusion, I confessed that I knew EXACTLY what she was talking about.

Ana took my revelation quite well, though I would've liked a little incredulousness. Nobody's ever surprised anymore.

Apparently she has some  trans clientele herself and offered to do my ""how's your father?"" once I, you know, get one. 

So now when my surgeon asks me if I have any questions I can go ""so yeah, I'm thinking of getting a piercing...how long should I wait...""

Laying down in the chair, surrounded by pictures of scantily clad women in corsets with a tall tattooed Amazon in a medical mask hovering over me while my partner watched, I couldn't remember if I was getting a piercing or if I had just been cast in a medical fetish movie. 

And then she said ""take a deep breath"" before harpooning my left ear lobe. I winced a lilttle, I'll admit. 

See Also: Big fucking crybaby.

Afterwards she did my right lobe, I cried a little more, and I got off the chair so Misty could hug me and tell me how brave I was.

See Also: Lies.

We both gave Ana a big hug and promised to come back (with chocolate, since apparently they keep pouring hard candies into her 'candy dish' and she can't fucking stand them) and went out to look for her car, which had a big sticker that said ""Jesus Had A Guiche"", just as she claimed it did. I wish I was wearing lipstick so I could've left an imprint on her door. 

But I'm glad I didn't. I would not be surprised if Ana would just kick my ass the next time I visited.

Misty and I sat in the truck for a few minutes, looking at our fancy new piercings and drinking the Monsters that the guy at the counter had just given us for free without any real explanation. Fuck, some places won't even let you split a check, and these guys just throw free shit they've got lying around at you. That's class.

It really, in the end, wasn't that painful. We just pretended it did so we had an excuse to walk over to Red Hot Robot and begin what I predict will become a crippling obsession with vinyl toys.",Shopping
B_OlUHu2720a1Gm8ICHrhA,-iOeI18tVuwxFHcqCe--fQ,1TZ1AGd22wIchtsWkTeG5Q,2014-06-19,"This office is located inside of a gym called Fitness Works, so you cannot see the office or any indication of its existence unless you walk into the gym. You do NOT need a gym membership. Just enter the gym and let them know at the front desk you are there to see the chiropractor. Reservations are recommended, but not required. Walk-ins are welcome, but pay close attention the days and hours of operation, as they are a little funky.

I was exercising at the gym when my back unexpectedly went out on me. I couldn't move and actually went into shock. They grabbed the doctor (I'd say Dr. Haggard, but there are many Dr. Haggards. There are several generations of chiropractors in the Haggard family, though only one Dr. Haggard works at this location. To avoid confusion of the other Dr. Haggards, I'll just call him Dr. Justin.)

He started asking me some questions and eventually I was able to walk with his assistance into his office and he took some X-rays to determine the severity of my injury and whether not an ambulance was needed.

He has a state of the art X-ray machine that sends the images digitally to a computer hooked up to 40""-class big screen TV so you can see what he is seeing and he can interpret the X-rays to you.

I've never had an issue with my back before, so at 45 years old, all of this was a new experience for me. I could barely walk and felt like I aged 20 years in a split second.

Luckily for me, the X-rays didn't show anything that required a hospital visit and Dr. Justin recommended I see him for adjustments to speed my recovery. 

We did that for a while and things got better, but my back was still sore. For at least two weeks I was not able to tie my own shoes without exceptional pain. Finding a comfortable position to sleep was also painful and frustrating.

Dr. Justin recommended something called a K-Laser combined with traction. He has all this new technology I've never seen before and didn't really appreciate what it did until I agreed to follow his suggestions for these treatments (even though I didn't fully understand what these treatments were.)

The traction tables are very cool. You lay flat on your back on a comfortable and modern-looking massage table. There are large velcro straps that he tightens around you and then he pushes some buttons and the table starts to vibrate and slowly make itself longer. The amount of pull is set by the doctor based on your size and weight, etc... The table also inclines, so the doctor will ask you if you are feeling any discomfort, and if you are, he adjusts the incline of the table and the discomfort magically goes away.

After the table, he used the K-laser on me. Not sure what this does or how. It's in a separate room and it gets very hot against your back and he moves it, pauses, moves it, pauses, etc... around the affected area. This is supposed to speed up the healing of the cells in the back (as I understand it).

He also had me using a stretching machine, which is a modern looking piece of exercise equipment that has you bending forward and back on a chair that rocks back and forth as you place your hands and feet in different positions for each type of stretch (which is detailed on the machine so you don't have to ask how to do the exercises - you can ask if you want to, but its all explained with diagrams on the machine itself.)

He also has several automated massage tables which were pure heaven when my back pain was severe. These tables are just amazing. You lay on one and you're going to want one for your house (until you find out how much they cost!)

He also has other traction equipment, not sure what its specifically called, but there are small weights attached to a rigging that go through a pulley system and  you place a strap behind your neck.

There is also a modern chiropractic table, where sections of the table drop from under you, usually unexpectedly, as he is 'cracking' your back.

The place can get pretty busy at times, but he or one of the employee's can assist you with an exercise or the massage table or whatever, while he tends to someone else. You do get one-on-one time with the doctor when necessary but, for the most part, he is constantly moving from one patient to the next, helping several people simultaneously.

Somehow, he seems to remember everyone's name and their ailment. He is also very friendly and has a lot of empathy. He also, as it turns out, is a very good chiropractor! I have waited until now to write this review so I can say with certainty if what he did helped or not. My injury occurred on 2-24-14 and today is 6-18-14. My back feels much better now, though I can (and will) benefit from future adjustments. But at least I can get back to work and have my life return mostly to normal. He showed me 'before and after' x-rays of my spine so I could see with my own eyes the effectiveness of the chiropractic care he was prescribing me and extinguish any skepticism I originally had. 

Highly recommended!!!",Beauty

First time we checked this place out on a Friday night when it first opened, and it as an absolute disaster. We waited to be seated forever even though the place was almost empty, the waitress did not know anything about the menu, had no idea what drinks were available, and was completely overwhelmed. Our food came out at different times (party of 6, and no one got to eat together), I ordered the half chicken and one of my friends did too... and they were both COMPLETELY F'IN RAW inside. I'm talking the plates were bloody and all. The waitress took it off our bill but the rest of the experience did not improve. Also, the food was so ridiculously overpriced. Almost ALL sort of understandable for a new restaurant, so I thought we'd give it another try mostly because we had a Groupon. 

Second visit was just about a week ago and NOTHING changed. We pulled up and thought the place was closed. We walked in and did not see anyone around. We waited for 5 or so minutes before some frantic guy ran out of the kitchen and finally seated us. He told us he was the waiter and cook. He served us water and left. We didn't see anyone else for about another 15 minutes... at this point I was ready to leave but I thought about the Groupon and that it needed to be used, so we stuck around. Finally, the owner walked in and came to our table. Turns out he was going to be our waiter. I know he was the owner because I have met him at their original location previously. He made it a point to tell us all of their food is fresh and made to order, and that they don't pre-make anything at all. He assured us we would love the food. We didn't mention our initial visit.

We placed our food orders right away. We tried to keep the dishes simple, especially after we looked at the menu and noticed the sky high prices. This shit was ridiculous. My sister ordered a $10 Caesar salad that was literally a couple of leaves of romaine lettuce and a side of french fries. My fiance ordered the ceviche. I ordered the half chicken again in hopes that it would be better this time. Owner claimed it was ""amazing"" and that I should order it and wait until it comes out so I can be amazed. I also ordered a glass of wine, and my sister got a vodka soda. He brought the glass of wine and everyone's food but mine. He proceeded to tell me that the half chicken will take ""a really long time to cook"" and asked if I wanted to wait, or order something else. Dude waited to tell me this WHILE bringing out everyone else's food. I changed my order and ordered french fries and the cordon blue. This shit was so bad, I had 2-3 bites and left the rest of it. Meanwhile, he never returned and we were assigned another waitress who was so lost, I felt bad even asking for anything else. 

We asked to pay and our bill came out somewhere around $70. With the Groupon, we ended up paying around $40. The waitress took my phone in the back and didn't come back with it for at least 5 minutes... weird.

All in all, it's a good thing this place closed because I'd hate to see anyone else wasting their time and money on a place like this. Just terrible.",Restaurant

In some cases, you will find items for less.  (Try regular, or low sodium, V 8 juice for 59 cents a can.

They always have special items for the current holiday.  The Anderson Split Pea soup that is $1.47 and up at the grocery stores is 99 cents here and they have different varieties.  I never failed to be surprised when I see individual french milled soaps next to bars of lava soap. They have a gourmet section that incudes things I have absolutely no idea of what they are used for but it's nice to know they are there if i ever need them?. In season, you will find plants that are two dollars less than Bashas has the same size at the time I write this.  I admit to being a shopper so I like just spending time and perusing almost all the shelves.  One of the latest things that really surprised me were boxes of extra large condoms made in colors only!!  Add spice to your sex life in how many different colors?

Now, it is time to figures out why this particular store on Indian School is unique and has the drawing power that it does for me.This is an interesting store.  The one on 12 th street that is just about the same distance to my house, is bigger and it isn't as crowded.  So why do I shop there more?  Is it because it was there first and I am used to it?  Is it because in this store I have run into people who clearly don't want to be seen shopping there-that's a biggie!  Maybe I just like the real diversity in the people that work and shop there.  Not that often do I get to use the smatterings of different languages I know with people who don't any more English than I know of their tongues.  Trying to make known that you need an alarm clock in Swahili is a challenge.  This store is truly an adventure and I love it!  It's not for the faint of heart.  And as I said before, what can be better than listening to the stammering explanation of someone who lives at Scottsdale Ranch and wouldn't  be caught dead in a place like that when you come around a corner and there they are pushing a full shopping cart.  That is as opposed to seeing someone like the dear lady I know who keeps a little winter place at the Biltmore, gushing over what terrific buys they have and being glad to see a friend. The only thing I wish they could change about this store would be to have someone there to keep the panhandlers out of the parking lot.  Even that can be interesting at times.  Someone asked me for change the other day, and the person looked at what I gave her and she told me that I could do better than that, couldn't I?  As she said, a dollar really didn't go as far as it did a year ago with the economy the way it is.  Who was I to argue with that line of thinking.  I gave her more and felt good about this budding economist.

One tip about getting to this store that can save you time.  You don't ever want to make a left turn into it or out of it in rush hour traffic.  Talk about having a death wish?  Instead, go north in the parking lot and make a left and go across the parking lot pass the Arthur Murray Dance studio and out to 12th st.   There another way to go out north but it takes you through neighborhoods full of people and cars.  I am sharing my secret with you.  It is so much easier, this way,",Shopping
Yumojjge4m9RhXtFiMYz5g,FAjCZoxiGw9HJKueB8YWTg,igHYkXZMLAc9UdV5VnR_AA,2014-01-02,"OMG!  This is the place to go if you are a local here!  Located in Tivoli Village, recently open (meaning less than a year old), this place is amazing!  I was first introduce to this place because my fiance heard about this place being raved about by his colleagues.  We came here for lunch and received the best service for a fine dining experience.  Usually when you go to a fine dining establishment during their ""non-busy"" hours, service has a tendency to be lacking but not this place!  Our server, Alex I believe was wonderful!  And everything he recommended was excellent.  He checked up on us when needed and wasn't to overbearing on attention.  It was just right.

The first thing he suggested was the Portobello Fries with Herb Aioli; it was battered lightly and when you take your first bite, you crunch and then you chew.  The mushroom is just soft and tender.

As our main course, we ordered the Hanger: Herb Marinade, grass fed and Skirt Steak: Hawaiian Cowboy, Wyoming Wagyu.  My entree was the Skirt steak, marinaded in a sweet soy sauce with a bit of a kick in spice.  So it was sweet & spicy.  The steak was tender and melted in your mouth.  As for the Hanger, wow, the flavor was just right!  The herbs that marinaded the steak was smokey and tantalizing in your mouth.  You can taste the smoke wood that the steak was grilled on with hints of simply seasoning of salt & pepper and herbs.

For the side we ordered the bloomsdale spinach, unlike regular spinach that wilt & shrink when cooked, they were crisp and mouth full!  The taste was sweetly bitter that you want to keep eating!

Unfortunately by the time we where done with our meal, we didn't have room for dessert.  So this would mean that we would go back and repeat the same thing again.

Now before I finish this review, I forgot the most uniquely important thing about this place...it's the butcher shop, the deli, smoothie counter and the bar!  When you first enter, you see a nicely set-up freezer that house all the meat you can possibly dream of!  From steak, to pork, to lamb...sausage...your mouth will drool!  To the deli station where if you are on the go, they make your sandwiches there while you watch.  With cured ham and all the deli meats that are ""hangable"" to lust after.  It also shares it's space with a smoothie counter where they literally take real fruit and make your smoothie or fruit juices in front of you.  You see all that goes into your healthy beverage!  Now if you are in the mood to be a little bit of an adult, the bar is conveniently located downstairs.  So while you wait for your table, you have ample space to sit at the bar or the lounge and enjoy a cocktail.

Overall the ambiance of the place is magnificent and greatly needed on this side of town!  I know where I will be going to get my meat when I am making pot roast or steak dinner.  I know where to go hang out with the girls for a low-key girls night out and enjoy gossiping!  This is definitely the place to be and so happy to have something like this on my side of town!  Better than Town Square!",Restaurant
xFv7dzMbYE6UDhhSu8Uakw,w0W8n164_muaeHfmq9En5A,zbrFk-4ejesAJD8EwcdHxg,2015-07-08,"My husband and I have enjoyed going to this restaurant for years. The food has always been excellent, until the last couple of times we've been. I would consider it only average. We come down from Anthem area so we've always felt the food was worthy of the 40+ minute drive to get there. However, our experience this past Monday night will keep me from ever going back. My husband and I as well as my two-year-old and my three-month-old arrived around 530, a little before the real rush started. It took ten minutes to get seated which I don't understand because the restaurant was only half full. The hostess' were not moving very quickly. Then we were sat in the farthest corner away from people as we could get which didn't really bother me since we have two little ones anyway. But where we were sat shared the wall to their private dining room for large groups and this particular group was incredibly loud. My husband and I had to raise our voices just to hear each other. This was particularly irritating since there were no less than seven empty tables around us that would have separated us from this group some. We got our chips and we each ordered a margarita. Before our drinks arrived, my youngest started getting very fussy so I went and changed her diaper and by the time we got back our drinks had arrived... but my daughter was still fussy. So fussy that we considered just going home... between the crowd next to us and her crying, this was not making for a very relaxing evening. But I decided to nurse her to see if we could salvage something from this evening. And I did... I covered myself up and fed her right there in the booth, especially since we were surrounded by empty tables. My margarita sat... and sat... and sat. Never touched it -- wasn't even within reach. Side note, the waitress never came to our table while I nursed so I suspect that she had issue with public breastfeeding even though I was completely covered up (I'm very modest). My husband finished his drink and then decided to drink mine since it was melting anyway. By the time I was done nursing, I was able to get exactly three sips from the bottom of the glass. So we decided to get a couple of coronas. The waitress finally came back and we ordered dinner and the bucket of 5 coronitas for $8. Then the waitress informed me that it was the restaurants policy not to serve a nursing woman more than one drink. I said that I didn't even drink mine, my husband did and that I just nursed and would not be nursing again for three hours. She said she would send the manager Jessica over. Jessica finally arrived after about 10 minutes with a most definite chip on her shoulder. She told me that the waitress was not comfortable serving me another drink. Hmmm... perhaps you guys should get your stories straight. She also said that the waitress saw me drinking the margarita while nursing. Well, that's impossible because she never came to the table while I nursed. By then, my baby was sleeping soundly in my arms and I asked jessica based on the way I was holding my baby, what did it look like I was doing from a distance? Nursing... and now that you're standing here, what does it look like. No answer. By then we had been sitting at our table for nearly an hour with no dinner and my two year old was about done. They brought us another basket of chips that tasted and smelled very stale and I was very irritated with the whole experience including how poor manager Jessica's attitude was toward me. Her demeanor made me feel like I was a nuisance and terrible person for wanting a beer with my dinner and that I was jeapordizing the health of my baby. 

As a business owner myself, I fully respect the right of a business to refuse service based on their beliefs. I am telling my story to explain my reason for never going back to this restaurant. They're reasoning was uneducated and instigated (I believe) by a waitress who took personal issue with my nursing my baby in public. Well, I took personal issue with her and Jessica's extremely poor customer service and so we left money for my husband's two margaritas and left the restaurant. We had been there for an hour... with only two margaritas and a stale bowl of chips to show for it. A complete waste of time and energy that  anyone with two little ones expends in just getting out the door, let alone sitting in a restaurant not getting served.",Restaurant
9aN8YsS8ZJ2bQMf63CozRA,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,DaVTuhzi6EgWStb2eAjNjA,2017-04-02,"Before coming to Presidio for Sunday brunch, I honestly hadn't given this place a second thought (or a first for that matter).  The menu as best I can tell is fairly standard Mexican fare (albeit with a few unique items mixed in).  But being the Yelp fanatic I am I took notice of the fact that owners Sergio Nava and Karen Remus went out of their way to make a video introduction of their restaurant on their Yelp page.  They highlighted the fact that much of the menu is actually native to the Michoacan region of Mexico rather than the Sonora region cuisine which most of us here in Arizona are used to.  So with that little bit of extra knowledge and with a 4.5 Yelp score as of this morning, I decided to give them a try.

The restaurant lines the northern perimeter of the Willo district on Thomas Road.  The restaurant faces St Joseph's Hospital just west of 5th Avenue on the south side of the street.  It can be easy to miss amongst the row of businesses as the restaurant is fairly narrow.  There's almost no parking up front so its best to go south on 5th Avenue and park behind the shopping center.  The interior of the restaurant can cram about 50 patrons at time (though surprisingly comfortably), and includes about 8 seats at the front bar area.  As the tables were full at 11am on this Sunday, I grabbed one of the bar seats.  The front kitchen doubles as the bar so I had a front row seat for all the food prep and drink mixing going on.  Sergio himself was my waiter and his Mom Lucina took charge of my food.

As with any Mexican establishment worth its weight I must of course start with a horchata.  Bad horchata usually means a bad forthcoming meal from my experience.  Fortunately, the horchata was just right and got my palate ready for the meal.  First off, their Mexican Street Corn appetizer.  Grilled corn (not corn on the cob thank goodness), chili powder, chipotle mayo, and cotija cheese.  Plus a lime to squeeze for a little extra acidity.  Nice starting dish.  Not spicy, but just a touch of heat and a really creamy mesh of the mayo and cheese.  For my main dish, the Enchiladas & Tamale entree seemed like a hearty (and highly customizable) menu option.  Two enchiladas of your choice (I went with a bean enchilada with red sauce and a chicken enchilada with green sauce) plus a tamale of your choice (I went with a pork tamale with red sauce).  The dish also comes with rice and beans plus a lettuce with a really heavenly cilantro dressing.  The colors on this dish reminded me of Christmas.  The portion sizes of each item were actually pretty modest so it was pretty easy for me to take down.  The tamale was excellent and the pork had a little extra unexpected spice, but didn't take away from the flavor at all.  The enchilada filings were quite good, though I was a little disappointed with the texture of the tortillas they used for the enchiladas.  They were a little rubbery in my opinion.  On the whole though, a good dish.  For dessert, I was torn between a flan and something I'd never heard of before called a banuelo.  Purely to satisfy my curiosity, I got the banuelo.  Basically a small fritter thats fried, covered in sugar and whipped cream and topped with fruit (in my case, a few blackberries).  Eats almost like one of those handheld sugary snacks you'd get wrapped in wax paper at the state fair.  A light, airy dessert that was okay but next time I'll probably get the flan.

Total cost for all the food, the horchata, tax, and tip came to about $30.  Plenty of food to get my belly full, though I'll admit I've gotten similar quality (and more quantity) at other Mexican establishments in town for cheaper.  I like the atmosphere at Presidio as Sergio and his family were all super nice and there were a bunch of families here throughout my meal.  My next trip here I'll probably try the tacos or their signature Quesadilla Roja entree.  Overall, certainly a place worth a try and a nice setup for a relatively small space.  A nice neighborhood spot for a quick Mexican meal from a region of Mexico many probably have never heard of.  But then again that's part of the beauty of food exploration isn't it?",Restaurant
ZhHohqtPV29r4yTtsp2H_g,4qdabQmbP_Fk6LBwbLSK1w,dHgbL5EAEawIcqk6aXe2Ow,2016-10-27,"Went for dinner last night and was disappointed.  The decor was clean and uncluttered with a black\/white color palette and bright (way too bright for fine dining) fluorescent lighting that was reminiscent of a hair salon.  I came early for my reservation and sat at the bar while waiting for my friend.  Bar was clean and well stocked and the bartenders were competent and friendly.  Once seated for dinner we were greeted by an enthusiastic and knowledgeable server.  Unfortunately for her the restaurant makes her serve food on cafeteria dishes.  They were ugly and old.  Not quite sure how an allegedly new restaurant has old ""family restaurant"" style plates.  That would be ok for say Grant Bar in Millvale (which is actually a great place to eat - go there) but not for dining downtown before a show.

Appetizers:  crab stuffed mushrooms - they were good.  Nothing special, slightly greasy and bland but not offensive in any way.  Fried zucchini- really good.  Fried perfectly with a nice marinara on the side.  Unfortunately the marinara was filled to the brim of a cafeteria cottage cheese\/apple sauce dish and dripping over the side.  Really sloppy plating.

Salad: basic side salad.  Fresh greens.  Your garden variety family restaurant salad.

Entree - Veal Romano.  It was a suspiciously large portion of three sizable pieces.  The plate was grease splattered and was not plated with any elegance.  Upon cutting it I realized that only two of the three pieces were veal the other being Chicken Romano.  The chicken was actually better than the veal and I was thankful I had it as the veal (which I didn't finish) was over-breaded and soppy with grease.  Got mashed potatoes and broccoli as a la carte sides.  The mashed potatoes were lukewarm, tasteless smashed redskins with ne'er a pinch of salt for flavor.  The broccoli was steamed, poorly cut into shrubbery sized pieces with large brown spots on the stems.  Completely inedible, unappetizing and should have never left the kitchen.  This wouldn't be served at a hospital yet at Peter Allen's it's an a la carte side.  It's absurd to complain about food being yucky and then in the next sentence complain about small portions but the a la carte sides were in those cafeteria cottage cheese dishes they love so much.  This is NOT an a la carte portion -at least not one you would get at a premium steakhouse, but the charge was similar and in my opinion a disservice to diners.

Dessert- Salt Carmel Truffles.  This was really good and I was happy our server (who again was really nice and deserved to work at a better restaurant) recommended it.  

Overall this was a poor dining experience and I won't go back.  (Two stars only for the staff - otherwise it would be one). Putting the wrong protein on a plate is a serious no-no and the rotten broccoli was scary.  The prices are lower than many other restaurants on the block, but it's still fine dining prices and they do not deliver a fine dining experience.  I was happy to see Bravo Franco go away and get replaced with something new because this is a great location and the city deserves a great place here, but it's menu is uninspired, dated and the food is slop.  Basically Bravo Franco with a fresh coat of paint.  

If you are seeing a show and do not have a reservation to any of the really good restaurants in the cultural district and need to just walk in, I would advise to stick to appetizers and dessert.",Restaurant

Still in a 'soft opening' phase, and located on the far end of ever gentrifying East Fremont, it was admittedly with baited breath that I'd watched PublicUS tumblr site ever since the restaurant was announced and as pictures and reviews began to spring up thanks to good words from John Curtas an early morning visit was planned, a quick message sent to Pastry Chef Hemant Kishore seeing the young Chef sit with me throughout my hour-long stay discussing things from the local food scene to his Southern Indian heritage, CIA Training, and inspiration behind each baked good.

Expansive in size, bathed in sunlight, and specked with handmade seating alongside live plants, it was just prior to 7am that I entered publicUS and finding Hemant just having laid out the daily bread while a few older men sipped coffee it was with wide eyes that I looked upon the somewhat limited offerings, and although the five pastries behind glass would inevitably end up part of the order my interest was even further piqued by a large breakfast menu - three more made-to-order options delivered to the table by still-green service shortly after a cup of rich single origin pour-over.

Speaking to Hemant as I tucked in, it was logically with warm items that the tasting began, and with the croissant shell shattering after slight flex a vast cavern of buttery aromatics poured forth, the use of quality European product obvious to anyone familiar while the light vanilla sugar glaze tickled the tongue without overwhelming one bit.

Next delivered the French Toast, a textbook Brioche that may be the menu's best bargain at $6 for two thick slices, those interested in custard-centered iterations of the dish will be happy to know the PublicUS kitchen is making one of Sin City's best while the caramelized bananas used both here and in the cardamom heavy banana bread showed great depth of flavor, particularly when drenched by a pot of boozy maple syrup.

Impressed by a scone that would likely confuse a proper Englishman while wowing most American palates with an interior softened by cream cheese it was next to the muffin that my tasting turned, and with an almost pudding-soft interior beneath a lightly browned top the bakery's best item was found, each bursting berry adding vibrant levity to all the butter, though a 'light' breakfast this stump-less round most certainly is not.

Underwhelmed by the $5.50 'toasts,' first off by how thin the housemade sourdough was sliced when considering the fact that a whole loaf can be had for $6, and then by the fact that they took nearly twenty minutes to make and still arrived cold, suffice it to say that PublicUS has a good idea going with the texturally compelling ""Beignet"" while the pears and almond butter were unfortunately lost amidst the sweet-savory goat cheese crusted grapes of ""Pear,"" the final bites of 'brookie' proving a far better investment as the brownie textured sandwich was delicate yet intense, the vinegar tinged toffee center something I'd gladly have jarred to drizzle on ice cream, or to spread on a more substantial piece of the sourdough bread.

Still finding their footing, but clearly a place with big plans plus a team seemingly ready and willing to do things right, PublicUS is a welcome addition to a city long-marred by a lack of innovative artisan baking.  Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with an immense parking lot directly next door it will be interesting to see how things develop over the coming months, though I doubt it will take me that long to return considering the bread pudding offered as lunch and dinner dessert.",Restaurant

I have been to North Park Lounge a few times now, and this past time was the first time I ordered food.  First the good, and actually the great thing about NPL is the outdoor bar area, something Murrysville bars\/restaurants don't have.    It is large, on a big deck covered, but open, with a ton of seating and a big bar equipped with several televisions for your viewing pleasure.  They also have a fine selection of drafts, and next year plan to open a cabana bar, which could prove to be pretty awesome.

So now the not so good.  Last time I stopped there was late on a Thursday night.  I was starving, running around all day, and literally had no food in me, so my mood was hangry.  Being hangry I swear I probably could've eaten about anything and thought it was good or better.  No so much this night.

When we got there we went to the outdoor bar.  As we were sitting down on the stools a bartender stood in front of us.  Both hands spread out on the bar as he leaned in at us and stared us down.  I looked up, said ""hello.""  He does return the gesture but the stance was awkward and unwelcoming.  He asked what we wanted to drink.  Never asked if we were eating, so I said ""you're still serving food right?""  He said yea and went to fetch menus.  I ordered a beer while I perused the menu.  Okay this menu is ridiculous.  It has to be 8-10 pages.  Way too much.  Also with all kinds of food options like pizza, wings, taco's, hamburgers, sandwiches, pasta's, ribs, fish dinners and many more.  The point being is the menu is so vast there is that great feeling that nothing can really be done great, or fresh cause there is just too much.  

I decided on a Reuben sandwich with my thought process being, who can screw that up?  I'm starving and Reuben's are usually big, and it's an all around comforting food when you are dealing with a case of the hangrys.  My husband got a pulled pork sandwich.  Mine came with regular fries, his sweet potato.

So we waited for our food.  The servers all seemed to be a little immature.   They would gather and talk not really walking around cleaning up things or making sure people were taken care of.  So out comes our food.  First impression.  Damn this is a small Reuben... I mean pretty damn small...   The meat was skimped, as was the thin bread, and the toppings.  Next the fries.   Bloody awful, stone cold and hard.  They were clearly made a while back in large batches and thrown on my plate with my sandwich.  I couldn't finish one of them.  They didn't even attempt to warm them just bring them out cold.  This became obnoxiously obvious when I tasted one of his sweet potato fries, which were not only warm but crispy.  Yep, it's safe to say they make at least one kind of fry to order.  Moving on my small sandwich was not pleasing.  I was so hungry I swear I could have eaten a boiled flip flop.  This sandwich had a very funny metallic taste to it.  I ate it, mostly because I was so hungry, but it really wasn't good.  I took the last few bites and tried to dissect where the weird taste was coming from.  I tried the meat alone and it seemed okay, but when I got to the sauerkraut and the sauce I could detect the rancid taste stronger.  I didn't finish that last bite, and the bartender took my plate away without asking how it was or even commenting on why I didn't touch the fries.  My husband's sandwich was also a fail, the pork, was dry yet greasy, and they bottom part of the bun disintegrated when he picked it up for the first time since it was saturated in grease.  

I will come back here to drink, since their outdoor facility is so nice, but I highly doubt I will ever eat here again.  If they can screw up the simple things, I can't imagine something more complex in there overstuffed menu.",Restaurant

On top of witnessing them using unsanitary practices, they always close the door to the room where they supposedly sanitize and make sure you can't see anything and return with utensils that are loose and not wrapped, and then pass utensils to each other while they are working on customers. I've never seen them sanitize the foot sinks between customers, they can be extremely rude. You don't get what they advertise and if you question them you are punished. My last 2 encounters described below. 

At first was excited to find what I thought was a great nail salon not far from my home after trying several in the area. I moved from Arizona in December, had an excellent salon I used for years in Scottsdale.

My first time At this salon, I had a guy, the only man,  who gave me the best pedicure I've ever had since leaving Phoenix although he was very rough and had a vice grip that at times hurt like hell, he would ease up when asked. I continued to go back for a few months not asking for him but I always being given him. 

A couple of weeks ago I showed up at my normal time on a Sunday 3:30 - 4. They appeared busy with 2 little girls and 2 women at the pedicure seats. They told me it would be just a minute, 45 mins later they ushered me back to a chair only after I stood up. The woman and girls were still not finished and I waited for another 20 minutes with my feet in the water, the water was now cold. The girls and ladies all got up and went to the front, I thought they were done. All the staff followed them, leaving me alone not saying a word. When I saw they were all now just starting their manicures, I asked for a towel and left.  (Over 1 1\/2hours later!!!)

I returned yesterday same day same time as usual 3:30, they weren't busy at all. Got the same guy again. At the start I felt something wasn't right, and I realized he was doing nothing like my other pedi's. He was rushing. He didn't put the callous jell on my feet or use the big scraper thing, didn't use the oil they rub Into the cuticles, and he was ready to start painting my toes after only 15 mins. (A pedicure here is about an hour normally) After stopping him and asking why he didn't do my callouses, asking why he was rushing, he and the others who work there all started making excuses from I didn't need my callouses done today  (it had been over a month!) And kept saying ""you said you want regular"". They have a menu they give you that has several choices. I always pick the first - regular no extra stuff. He got so mad at me and again pretended like I was crazy, and pretended he didn't know how to do calluses. He didn't use any of the natural products that are part of this $30 pedicure. He pulled an u sanitized rasp out of his drawer and with my feet dry pretended to use this unsanitary rasp. He still didn't even come close to the great manicure I was accustomed to here. I just wanted to get out of here. When he was done he picked up the picture of the regular manicure from the menu and angrily pointed at each step saying ""I did this"" ""you happy now?"" He didn't do everything but at this point I was scared  and doing all I could not to cry to be honest. 

Apparently they were still angry after I left 2 weeks ago. They understand English and speak English very well but today they all pretended like they understood no English. I really thought maybe I was going crazy or in the Wrong place!

I was going to get a gel manicure and changed my mind after all this, I just wanted the fastest way to get out of here which made the woman's who was doing my manicure  angry ( I think she's an owner), and I only got polish no lotion on my hands and arms, no cuticle oil, and no hand and arm  massage like usual with a regular manicure. I left giving no tip and will never return.",Beauty

The tone is set by the young hostess, who was dressed for the beach: a hooded sweatshirt, seersucker shorts, and flat canvas shoes.  If one is seeking ambiance, this is not the place, though it is reasonably attractive and comfortable, and the tables and booths allow plenty of space to relax.

Diners may bring their own alcohol and there appears to be no corkage fee for wine.  

The restaurant became extremely loud as the evening went on as some of the diners overindulged in wine.

The restaurant is in its first few weeks of operation, and it shows.

Our harried, but pleasant young female server forgot our request for water and hot tea.  After fifteen minutes, we received water after asking a second time. She was apologetic.  Later in the meal, a refill was provided without our having to ask.  We did not receive the tea.

My wife ordered a sushi platter with salad and miso soup with seaweed.  The good-sized salad with iceberg lettuce, carrots, and tasty ginger dressing arrived twenty minutes after the dinner order was placed, the soup a few minutes later. The sushi was brought to the table several minutes before my hot items. There were eighteen pieces in this large platter of sushi, which she enjoyed, a bargain for $10.95.

I ordered chicken egg roll ($1.95), chow fun noodles with pork (a flat, wide egg noodle) (yes, very unhealthful: a splurge), $9.00, and tofu (bean curd) with mixed vegetables: broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, snow peas ($8.95). The egg roll came within a few minutes of ordering, but  it was a vegetable roll, not the chicken variety I had ordered.  Instead of asking me whether I wanted the vegetable roll, the server instructed me to eat it and that she would order the chicken roll.  I did as she directed and consumed both.  Neither was particularly tasty and both were served lukewarm, at best.  Both of the entrees were a good portion, tasty, and served in delicious sauces: not too oily, but the tofu dish was drowning in the sauce, causing it to be soggy. Both dishes were the proper temperature: steaming hot.  Neither of the large platters was brought with any serving utensil.

Although the take-out menu shows an American Express icon in the section where accepted credit cards are listed, the server told me that the restaurant does not accept it.

I understand the husband and wife owners, Mr. and Mrs. Ho, are lovely people, but they were apparently not present on this evening.  No owner or manager was overseeing the dining room and no one other than the server checked on us.

In most respects, I compare Rice Inn unfavorably to my favorite Asian restaurant in the area, Red Tea House in the Virginia Manor Shops in Mount Lebanon.  Red Tea House is somewhat more expensive and the portions are somewhat smaller, but it consistently offers great service and artistically-presented cuisine, ambiance, and top-notch management, which oversees the dining room and makes every guest feel welcome. Water and tea are not ever forgotten at Red Tea House because these items are brought when the server first approaches the customer, along with delicious crisp noodles (alas, also unhealthful.)

For value, convenience, and reasonably good food, I am likely to return to Rice Inn on occasion, but it is not at the top of my list.

The restaurant also offers Thai cuisine, including the famous Pad Thai.  It maintains no website and does not advertise.",Restaurant
jtevHbPZRcB28-YjK6PCLQ,PckmukXXYl6NM6LxH6fVAA,gmGHRByX_Z1iJenUuaW0kw,2016-11-02,"After a year of major health issues and general stress, I decided to splurge and treat myself to a Mind and Body Escape at Elmwood Spa. Although there was a disappointing snag to my day, the way management handled it was commendable. Read on for the full story!

Check-in was pleasant, although the ""warm towel"" I was offered by the trainee was cold.  This wasn't a big issue for me- I thought it was strange they offered a towel upon arrival at all, since I had to touch the germy tablet to input my health information afterwards, anyway.

The employees who attend to you as you stepped off the elevator on the 2nd and 3rd floors were attentive and helpful. My day started out well with a good 45 minutes in the Water Therapies- very nice!

Massage: Swedish Massage, 50 min. Kate was a great RMT, despite her small frame. The curtains in my room did not block all the sunlight (it was 11am), I could hear delivery trucks on the street, although I suppose that can't be helped. The massage itself was relaxing and soothing, and she did a decent job working my achey muscles.
Facial: Essential facial with masque, 60 min. Juliett worked silently, which I'm sure some would appreciate. I like knowing what is being applied just for information's sake, but this was also verrrry relaxing and I almost dozed off.
Lunch: arugula salad (fine), trout (tasty!), and arborio rice pudding (could not eat)
Pedicure: technician was a no-show. More on this later.
Manicure: my nail technician Bafa arrived early and was able to see me ahead of schedule, since my pedicure was cancelled. She was very patient and let me try a couple colours before we both agreed on the shade of red that looked good on me. She gave me a good Essential Manicure, complete with a simple arm massage. For a ""high-end"" salon, the nail polishes seemed a bit old and chunky. 

OK- so apparently the nail technician for my pedicure had called in sick and somehow a new tech hadn't been assigned to me in the computer system. That's fine. Mistakes happen. But my issue was that I had sat waiting in the 2nd floor waiting area for 20 minutes, had asked two different nail technicians that I was looking for my nail tech, and was told both times to ""just wait"". No ""oh, let me check if she's here"" or ""let me get the floor attendant"". There must've been at least 5 nail techs in the area, who saw me sitting there and didn't offer any assistance. After about 20 minutes the floor attendant happened to walk by and when I stopped her and told her that I had been left waiting, she quickly did her best to resolve the situation. Because we were so behind schedule I could not wait to have my pedicure done by someone else. The manager came by to let me know I would receive a rain check for an upgraded pedi to use in the future. I was very happy with how the situation was eventually handled but this definitely put a damper on what was supposed to be a stress-free and extravagant treat. I never go to the spa and this was a somewhat disappointing first experience. #firstworldproblems I know... 

Having said all this, I am definitely game for giving Elmwood Spa another try. I do love the Water Therapies, the staff who seem genuine and helpful, and the old, but impressive building. They have specials all the time and if the pedicure snafu hadn't happened it would've been a very nice day. I look forward to increasing my star rating!",Beauty
ayGA4OacE0xFFWjDLCYN5Q,WMXL3NuljK-WojVwU7hK3g,bN-B_n-tDPU_mwOFNWPbXA,2012-11-14,"First of all, I want to state that I am a professional male in his mid-forties with a disposable income, and not a teenager: consequently, I can spend a large amount of my income on music, as opposed to just buying the odd CD or LP every once in a while.   Having said that, often - after work on a Friday afternoon - I will purchase new music at a number of places in the Toronto area (depending on where I am working that particular day).  Until recently, one of those establishments was Sonic Boom. 

Over the years I have spent thousands upon thousands of dollars at Sonic Boom, ever since it first opened its doors.  So often have I purchased material from them, that many - if not all - of its employees clearly recognize me as a steady, paying customer.  So much so, that it was a big surprise to me when I recently entered the store, and was pursued, harassed, and insulted, all because I carried a large bag. 

Employees told me that the owner has established a new rule that people with large bags must check them in at the front counter due to a recent and higher level of theft from their LP section, implying that I am now a potential thief.

Normally, I might not have a problem with this policy if it were at least applied consistently and respectfully without prejudice.  However, one look around and I could see women with large bags freely roaming the store.  Apparently, they were exempt at the time because, according to the employees, they carried valuables in their purses (meanwhile, my bag had my wallet, 160 GB iPod, a Playbook, my cell phone, CD player, work papers, keys, personal and irreplaceable items, etc.).  So, instead of being applied fairly, their policy seems to be a very arbitrary one, perhaps even, as in this case, based on gender.

Later, when I tried to retrieve my bag, another employee refused to return my valuables until I produced a playing card from a deck (the 3 of clubs to be specific) that they had given me moments earlier, and which I forgot that I had in the subsequent confiscation and turmoil, and now had trouble finding in my pocket.

This employee was abrasive and rude.  When I tried to calmly speak with him about my earlier treatment (remember I am a middle-aged man), and voice some concern about the application of their new policy, he then asked me to ""get out of his face,"" before handing me a card, and telling me to call the owner about ""my problem.""

Approximately, a month or so later, I was in the process of introducing my nephew (a DJ), who was new to Toronto, around to all of the record stores at his request.  During our trip around the city, we both overheard customers in other record stores complaining about Sonic Boom's new policy, and about its harassing nature to even regular customers.

Upon walking by Sonic Boom with my nephew, I once again observed people walking around inside the store with large bags and left to their own devices (in one case, an older gentleman).  With no intention of going inside, I changed my mind when I saw a Manager\/Owner behind the counter.  At this point, I entered and tried to talk reasonably with him about the prior incident and their policy, but instead found him also to be very condescending in his dismissive attitude.  When I mention the fact that other long-time customers seemed concerned as well, he said that such people were ""Sad"" and pathetic, implying that I could include myself in his assessment.

It would seem to me that for him, and the store, there is not only a presumption that every potential customer is a thief (by placing the onus of the store's security squarely on the customer's shoulders) - but also even proven, clearly loyal, and recognizable customers - totally defying any use of common sense (of course, the problem with so-called ""common sense"" is that - and as Sonic Boom so clearly demonstrates in this case - it is not too common).

Now, I will state that I have chosen to exercise my right as a consumer and show my dissatisfaction by boycotting the store, and posting this review.  I see no reason to give Sonic Boom my hard earned money any longer, and frankly they don't seem to care.  However, if I am to go by what I am hearing at other stores, they should start to care, because I will certainly not be alone.

Finally, I find it very ""sad"" that Sonic Boom has sunk so low as to - as another Yelp reviewer once put it - ""perpetuate the stereotype that record store workers are a bunch of wannabe rock stars and disillusioned  DJ's who hide behind a pompous veil of sarcasm and exclusivity to mask their unfulfilled dreams...",Shopping
UMGT6goNShGzB8UCBsUhVQ,oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,sKA6EOpxvBtCg7Ipuhl1RQ,2017-12-03,"Las Vegas' FIRST conveyor belt sushi restaurant! 

Came here tonight with some friends and my husband. It was their soft pre-opening or something? Apparently they were opened the last two nights as well but it was invite only. I'm super jealous that some people got invited! 

I saw on Facebook that they were opened for a limited time on Dec. 2nd for dinner 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm. When I saw that, I immediately showed it to my friends and husband, planned for an early dinner at 5:00 pm. The parking situation is a little weird because they had a lot of parking spots but a lot of them had names of other establishments or they had the word ""reserved"" on them. Except there's a sign in front of Sapporo saying that you can park anywhere. Sooooo not really sure how that really goes.

We got there a bit early and got seated right away. They told us already that the food won't come out until 5:00 pm and we were fine with that. They have an iPad system on all the tables where you can order things if you don't want to grab it from the conveyor belt. The iPad also keeps a tally of all the things you ordered, which is great. 

As you can probably tell by now, they have a conveyor belt with different types of nigiri. They even have signs before them so you know what you're grabbing. What I did notice is that the sushi starts in the middle of the room before making it to the other side, which kind of sucks because if there was something we wanted ... but everyone else also wanted, we wouldn't be able to get it. We could order it .. but we also noticed that the fish isn't consistent. Some pieces would be fattier and other pieces would be more lean. There wasn't enough salmon on the conveyor belt for us so we had to order two more orders but they came out quite lean. We like our fatty salmon belly pieces! Booo! 

Also, for the ordering system, they have a custom cart that stops right in front of your table with your order when it's ready. It also tells you, ""Your order is here. Please take your order."" Super cool. It reminds me of some of the sushi places in Japan that does that. 

Onto the sushi! We focused mainly on the nigiris. They have rolls too. Each plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50. They have hand rolls too but you have to order them. They weren't on the belt. They are also $2.50. They have udon and ramen to order. The nigiri are mostly two pieces to a plate unless you get the premium items: toro, king crab, uni. Those are one piece per plate for $2.50. Honestly, toro for that price is a STEAL. Most establishments charge $8-10 for one piece of toro. The sushi is quite fresh. I think the only thing I didn't care for is the rice. It was good but it was missing something. They also packed it a lot where it doesn't feel as soft -- felt a bit more hard and squished. 

Don't worry about the fish staying out too long. Their conveyor belt has senors whenever a plate gets put on there. They have a timer for it so if a plate has been on the belt for 30 minutes and hasn't been eaten, it will be trashed!

You keep the plates at your table so at the end of your meal, they can tally it up and give you your total. Service was great -- they were willing to split our check in anyway we want! 

TIP: If you're a huge eater, this may not be the place for you. These things can add up fast. I would suggest you do AYCE if you eat a ton. Haha. 

This place brings back memories of when I used to have the boat sushi back in San Francisco with my mom and grandma. 

Overall, decent quality. Good service. I would come back :) And would suggest people give it a try.",Restaurant

A friend and I meant to eat at the Korean bbq nearby, but the waiting times weren't meshing with the hunger. We stared at the menu and were intrigued. And so we entered...

Immediately greeted. Thank You! Believe me...I have been to businesses sitting empty and had to stand there awkwardly. Not here. Service was absolutely wonderful. Very attentive, friendly, and plain out on point. 

It's a Japanese-italian fusion wonderfully done. I ordered their nakamura-ya style bruschetta. The octopus with the avocado and wasabi mayo was absolutely my fave on that plate. The other two, while delicious, was just not as beautiful in my wife as the octopus. Lol.
My friend wanted their garlic bread. He has had his fair share of experience in a kitchen and he said that was the best garlic bread he's had. I wouldn't know. He didn't share. Hahahha. Clearly, it was too good he didn't want to offer me some. All good as I didn't want my palate to get mixed up with what I had. Def didn't want the garlic breath. Don't get me wrong, I do love me some garlic bread. Just wasn't interested on this night. The Italian spring roll was pretty clever I'd say. I liked it.

I ordered the spaghetti tuna. The dish was rather generous in serving as I didn't finish it all. Noodles were cooked to al dente.. which is perfect because that's how I like it. The dish was not overly fishy, and I found the flavor to be light. The vegetables were crisp and not soggy. Just awesome.

Finally, we shared the Nakamura-ya's 3 sampler. THIS was a hit for us two. I was in dolce heaven. My friend and I swear were practically having food-gasms at the table. Lmao. Honestly, I'm not one for dessert after dinner. On this night, I was more than happy to have had dessert. Each dessert sampled was absolutely yummy. Our fave was the panna cotta and the black sesame. I'm not much of a tiramisu type gal, so I was surprised that I even enjoyed it here.

They offer interesting things on their menu that you've probably seen on tv and wished we had somewhere to go eat it. Uni cream....squid ink? Tis here, folks.

This was such a wonderful experience for us. Haven't had such a great dining experience where everything was wonderful in soooo long until I had dinner here. I'd personally leaves the kids at home as it would be a better experience without them and didn't think the menu was kid friendly or appetizing unless your kid has some serious tastebuds. I'd take my 10 year old here, but definitely not my 8, 4, and 2 year old. 

Parking in this complex can be a bitch...yes. But I Highly recommend this place! Enjoy!",Restaurant
om_elPFd7AfDrX72YWRGxw,3H-9i1ue967nzo9fnfhKFg,POtP9M6W4puE3Dr2FSAxzQ,2013-08-07,"I have been going to this spa approximately every 2 weeks for 3 years, and have never seen a single customer leave unhappy.  I followed my manicurist there from Chandler (yes, I drive over 30 minutes each way), but I do so because I love this place.  Lynn, the owner, is very kind.  She has given me a Christmas present every year, as a thank you for driving so far out of my way.
Chi, my manicurist, is excellent!  She is the reason I come, but she is in good company!  Linda, another manicurist, is also excellent.  Linda's English isn't so good, but she has learned a lot over the three years I have known her.  She also does eyebrows, and does a fantastic job!  
I have three daughters, and whenever I can, I take them (or my BF or my mom), so they can have the same great experience that I do.
Here are the great amenities:
1) Spa chairs at every station (the salon just doubled in size, so there are twice as many now);
2) A nice, granite bar where all nail services are completed;
3) Consistent personnel, with little turnover (this speaks to Lynn's kindness and management abilities);
4) An older, more experience clientele (yeah, that includes me);
5) Free cold refreshments, a Keurig for coffee and tea, and often a cookie or other sweet treat;
6) A very nice, relaxing environment (great ocean motif, relaxing music, and a full-time housekeeper);
7) Reasonable prices that include a 5-minute back massage with all spa services.

As you can see, there are many reasons to love this place.  I was very frustrated to see so many poor reviews!  So, I would like to address some things:
a) Yes, it is almost always busy.  But, so are many salons now that the economy has improved.  If you want to avoid the rush, come on a Tuesday or Wednesday during working hours---sometimes I am the only customer there!
b) The owner and staff are from Vietnam.  That's just the way it is, and since I am sensitive to all cultures, it doesn't bother me at all.  Since I have had Chi for over 5 years, she often explains to me what the joke is.  IT HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE CUSTOMER!  I have to say, one time I was surprised because Lynn was talking to another nail tech in a stern voice (in Vietnamese), and when I asked what it was, I was told that she HADN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE CUSTOMER!!!
Lynn is very serious about her product, and this was evidence of it.
c) As far as being left in the gel soak off station for over 45 minutes--that would have frustrated me, too.  However, I would have spoken up as soon as they were soft.  You don't get anywhere in life if you are not willing to stand up for yourself.  What did you do with the goopy stuff hanging from your nails???? I think I would have rather gotten good treatment at the time, rather than storming off angry.
d) As far as the UV burns go, I have never had this happen, and I have gotten gels quite a few times.  However, I think that you may just be sensitive to the UV rays, and probably should stop getting gels.  Happy Feet doesn't make the UV devices, they just use them.  So, no matter where you go---be very careful!
e)  About bleeding---Okay, guys.  Let's be real.  Skin has several layers, and then there's blood underneath.  (I know, I'm a nurse.)  So, if your skin gets too soft, or is shaved too low, you're going to bleed.  It's the same thing that happens if you pull a hangnail out at home.  You bleed.  It is not the end of the world.  That is the risk of going to a nail salon, and we have all had that experience.  But, I would like a nail tech who takes the time to do things right, even if I get a little cut.  My cut will heal in a day or two, while my nails will look FANTASTIC for a couple of weeks.  If bleeding was so hard on us, we wouldn't heal so quickly.

In conclusion, this is a great, and oftentimes busy, place.  If you are going, call ahead and make an appointment.  If you have complaints, don't hold them in.  I know that Lynn and others would be happy to make you happy.  And, if you don't like people from other countries speaking their native language, stay out of nail shops---unless, of course, you want to pay $50 for a manicure.  I have a few of those in Chandler, but they don't do a very good or consistent job.  But, they ALL speak English.",Beauty

Like many of the other negative reviews, I bought the Groupon for Townsley Portraits and my experience has been all around horrible from start to finish (since I don't have my pictures, I am not sure there technically has been a finish). When I emailed them to set up the appointment, I requested a specific date for a photo shoot at the Santa Monica Pier, which they will only shoot at on week days. Admittedly, my email had a typo and I asked for ""Friday, July 13"" (that Friday was actually July 12). I get an email from Adam telling me that my photo shoot is scheduled for July 7 - huh?!? I emailed back and said I could not do that date, could we please schedule for the date I specifically requested. I got a rather snarly email back from Adam stating that he didn't understand my first email because Friday was not July 13. I get it, I had a typo, but I don't think it was a typo that rendered my entire email mind boggling. If he really couldn't figure it out, he could have sent a simple and friendly email requesting clarification. Eventually, the date issue was straightened out.

Fast forward to the Wednesday before the photo shoot. Adam sends me a Google calendar reminder stating the appointment is at 5:00 pm, which I find very odd since my appointment was originally scheduled for 10:30 am. I email Adam to ask for clarification and his response was that my Google calendar was in the wrong time zone, which is why it said that my appointment was at 5:00 pm when it was really 10:30 am. Odd because I regularly use Google calendar and it is always in Pacific standard time zone. Once again, I was baffled by this blame the customer attitude. Anyhow, it is all eventually straightened out and, as far as I am aware, we are confirmed for our appointment.

Thursday afternoon at about 3:00 pm and 4:58 pm, I get voicemails from Adam requesting that I confirm the photo shoot. Isn't that what I did the day before??? The second message says that if I don't confirm by 5:00 pm my appointment will be cancelled unless I call Stuart to confirm that evening.

Since I didn't get the messages until after 5, I went ahead and called Stuart. When I talked to Stuart I explained the situation and that I am not sure why I needed to confirm again. Stuart also said he didn't know why I was told I had to confirm again, but he had me down on his appointment book. He then told me he was in the middle of something and he would call back later and then hung up on me. He never called back, but I guess that didn't matter since I didn't need to talk to him anymore since I had confirmed that my appointment hadn't been cancelled (I would have told him that if I had the chance to before he hung up).

Day of the appointment we arrive a little early because a big deal was made about  not arriving late. Stuart was running late. Trying to keep an almost 1.5 year old clean and happy on the Santa Monica Pier was an interesting experience while we waited for Stuart to show up. Once we finally hooked with Stuart, he repeatedly called my husband and I by various wrong names. He definitely has a formulaic approach to taking pictures as he runs through what is an obvious routine for his photo shoots. The photo shoot ends with my having to make a viewing appointment and I learn that weekend viewing appointments are not offered. I work full time so this presents a challenging issue. Eventually, I was able to set an appointment for a time that I happened to already be in their neighborhood for work. I was also given a brochure with their prices and I was pretty shocked by the prices (I have done multiple photo shoots with high-end photographers and Townsley Portrait's prices were significantly higher).

Unfortunately, the morning before my 1:00 pm viewing appointment I find out that my appointment that was supposed to be after my viewing appointment was moved up and now conflicted with my viewing appointment. Since I try pretty hard to avoid getting fired from my job, I email Adam more than 24 hours before my viewing appointment to let him know about my conflict and I request to reschedule. I don't get a response, which was kind of odd because at other times Adam emailed me back within minutes. I didn't think much of it until I get a voicemail at 1:30 pm (which I didn't get until later because I was doing my job) saying they were waiting for me to arrive at my viewing appointment and if I don't make it I will be charged $100 to reschedule. I sent Adam another email as soon as I could forwarding him my email from the day before requesting to reschedule my appointment. So far, I have gotten no response whatsoever to my request to reschedule. I strongly suspect my email was intentionally ignored so they could claim it was never received and then try to charge me $100 to reschedule the viewing appointment. I will not be paying $100 to look at the pictures so I am not sure if I will ever get to see the final product. I will update if I do.",Shopping

I will admit that I had some difficulty finding this place, because their sign on the window is a little hard to see. (Tip: it's right beside the giant Keg Steakhouse.) However, the place, once I finally found it, is absolutely beautiful. Half of the space is a cafe, Colette Petit Cafe, while the other half hosts the mani\/pedi\/blowout area. I adore the whole look of this place: very bright, lots of spotless white\/light coloured counters and shelving, light tan coloured tiling, high ceilings. Hands down the most glamorous place I have ever gotten my nails done - you don't even feel like you're at a nail place, more like you're in someone's kitchen or home or something. 

One qualm I have about this place is that it can be a little bit confusing to navigate your way around. The check-in counter is at the back of the cafe. I had no idea at first and walked straight to the nail area and stood around awkwardly until someone took pity on me and came to assist me.  

In terms of the actual manicure, it was a pretty pleasant experience for the most part. My friend and I both got the signature gel manicure ($45) which includes a hand massage at the end :) The lady working on my nails didn't seem particularly chatty or friendly (my friend's manicurist was so much friendlier), but she did her job well so I can't really complain that much. They are super clean, so they let you take home the nail file and buffer that they use, or else they just throw it out. Also the lotion they use on your hands at the end smells amazing (made by LoveFresh) and you can purchase it here! I have never left a manicure session smelling so fragrant and feeling so pampered and glowy on the inside, there is no other way to describe it!

Prior to our manicures, my friend ordered tea and I got three macarons to try. They have a limited selection (I only saw 6 flavours) and they are quite pricey, even for macarons ($3.75 each). However, they are larger than the ones you get at other places and they also have very interesting flavours! I tried coconut passionfruit, pistachio cranberry, and a pink one which tasted kind of chocolatey but I can't remember what it was. I was very impressed with the macarons - they all tasted amazing and the texture was perfect! You can also get 6 macarons for $20. Service from the cafe was very good, as servers will come over to the manicure area to take orders and check to see if you want any drinks. They offer cocktails, juices, wine, tea, coffee, anything your heart desires.

I very much enjoyed my experience here and am kind of obsessed with this place now! For such a nice looking place, I actually don't think the prices are that expensive for downtown standards. (i.e. their basic manicure is $25 and they have a great selection of polishes which includes brands like Deborah Lippmann along with the usual OPI and Essie as well as other less common brands.) I wouldn't come here all the time though, because I think you are really paying for the experience and it is a lot more fun to come with a group of friends. That being said, next time my friends and I feel like treating ourselves, you can bet that we will be returning to HMP to get the royal treatment that we all deserve :)

Also for people complaining about their crappy website before, they must have updated it or something because now it looks great and is very informative with all prices listed, lots of pictures, and the ability to book an appointment online!",Beauty

Not many people would know that I have acne skin, since makeup... does wonders in camouflaging my imperfections. I also have sun spots and hyper-pigmentation, which is more prone in Asian skin. I went to check this place out, in hopes it would improve my skin appearance as well as its overall condition. From looking in the mirror after this treatment, I noticed my skin more radiant and it had this fresh gleaming glow. I loved the way my skin felt and looked.. I didn't even want to put any foundation on at all. So proud of myself, since I wouldn't dare leave home without having my game face on. 

Skin Boutique is located inside Sola Salons *individual studios you can rent out* in the back by Lowe's and next to HomeGoods store in Henderson. If you're getting off the 215 freeway exiting Eastern, you'll make a right into the shopping center that is right before St. Rose Parkway. Don't make a right on St. Rose Parkway, because there's some construction work going on that side and you'll completely miss the one entrance they have open, which causes you to drive all they way down the street to be able to come back around. How I know all this.. well that's what happened to me today. I was a lost puppy in this city. 

I was scheduled with Stephanie Valentino.. love her last name.. and she called me in the morning to confirm that I'll be showing up. If you don't know, I suffer from insomnia and some days I really don't get any sleep. Last night was one of them..  I called Stephanie back and told her I'm running about 15-20mins late. She not only was accommodating, but just told me to call her when I'm nearby, so she could meet me there. I love it when I'm not rushed or treated differently from not being punctual. Usually I'm good in making appointments on time, this was just one of those off days. I finally arrive and walked into her studio, which had just enough room for all her equipment and us. I thought it was a great idea if anybody would like to branch off to open their own business. Stephanie welcomed me with a warm smile and asked me to fill out a questionnaire before we got started with my facial. Once that was taken care of, I changed into a spa robe, that wraps around you, and tucked myself in the bed. She began my facial with a nice cleanse and processed to steam my face to do extractions. Next she put on a soothing herbal mask, it felt so light and refreshing.. my skin almost wanted to say Ahhh. While having the mask on, she covered my eyes with some cotton eye pads and began the ultrasonic application and face-strobing around my face for a good 10-15mins. It felt like a ball of light was being rolled all over my face, but also my face was being massaged at the same time. After that she took off the mask and started to do a patterned dance with her fingers on my face, which was smooth and relaxing. I enjoyed her technique and style of movement. Every Esthetician has their own kind of ways of doing a facial and it's nice to experience different ones, unique to their own. I enjoyed my facial so much from Stephanie that I purchased a holiday special of buy 3, get 2 free! Plus additional $15 off. It's originally $50 each photofacial, but with this deal I saved $250.. making it a total of $135!!! Love great deals, so I had to purchase this. I asked her if she could extend this offer, so other Yelpers can take advantage of this wonderful deal, which she was more than happy to comply. So get on it!!! And if you don't want to use all of your facials, she said you can even give them away as gifts. Perfect timing for Christmas gifts! 

She's also doing a Holiday Yelp Special!!! Purchase Dates:  Dec 1- Dec 24. Services exp June 2012 -must be used on or before.

I live in Summerlin\/Spring Valley SW whatever you want to call it area. I don't go out to Henderson that much and sometimes it's nice to go to a place like this, just so you can get out and explore. I don't mind the drive at all, since I know it's worth it to me. Plus on your way back to the SW... you can always stop by the Silverado Ranch Plaza and have tons of fun looking at all the shops there. It's actually one of my favorite places to go whenever I'm around the area. Give yourself some pampering.. the year is almost over, and Christmas is near... Stephanie is so easy going, artistic in doing facials, and loved the way she treated me. For this holiday season, give yourself and your loved ones some TLC at Skin Boutique. Yelpers enjoy!",Beauty
Re_4Nf-xRL78EQLq__dOKQ,3VgJ0gRZ7pACEBw5GtIsAg,1bLau_c0fkCKrJYu2zG6Xw,2015-12-25,"* It depends *

Background: 
- I looked through all the reviews on Yelp haha! 
- On a rainy normal Tuesday evening I went to almost every salon (eg. Maya, Sora etc found in Yelp) in Koreatown to compare the price and stuff like that. But at last I chose here based on my personal preference (would like a Korean-style haircut instead of a Japanese one), and maybe the relatively high number of waiting customers at GOA.
- Just so you know that I am not a native speaker or a Korean; I am a pretty shy asian generally. Plus I don't quite care about how my hair looks like except they stole all my hair lol ! 

First Expression: (why they lost one star)
- When me and my boyfriend walked into the salon, we saw a lot of customers sitting on the sofas waiting for a haircut! When we wanted to ask for the price list however we can find no one; every staff there were working hard on their job.
- Finally! We waited for a chance to speak to one of them! (It depends though, since we were quite shy maybe so we started off like that haha) We booked an appointment and we went back after 2 hours.
P.S. the stylist spoke English to us politely 

Jorney begins: 
- Once I settled my coat at the ""hanger corner"" I followed my stylist to one of the chairs. 
- And we will discuss about how she could do for me: she asked me how much do I want to cut to (Just showed her) and do I want layers or no (Just say yes\/no)
- Then I showed her a photo for how I would like to cut my bangs. (Basically it is ""see-through bang"" that is popular in Korea) She got it faster than I think (with just a glimpse of my provided photo!)
- Suggestions: Like some of the Yelp reviews, I would also suggest bringing a photo with you to let your stylist know exactly what you want. Also in my opinion, it's not difficult to communicate with my stylist using simple yes and no english (unless you want complex style:( still you could show photos!!)
- After that another male staff lead me to wash my hair first. Since I have seriously damaged hair that my hair tangled like a mess after the wash, they offered me another wash with a different shampoo. I think he did a better job than what I read in the Yelp reviews; he carefully put a towel over my eyes to avoid water spashing, and the water temperature was just warm enough. Even when my stylist (yes, both the male staff and female stylist washed my hair) used cold water for some reason, she would acknowledge me first before washing. (Note: she might say Korean, but you will know when you hear ""cold"" :))
- Then my stylist started her job. I couldn't comment on anything about the process because I am not a professional, but at least I would like to say that the journey was enjoyable. I just let them to cut my hair as she wanted since I know once I decided to go into this salon this means that I have given all my confidence and trust to them. 
- At last, my stylist asked me what style do I want to finish the look: curl or straight.(Got it done and you're good to go!)

Some comments:
- Service 
Service was actually great for me as well as my friend, except they won't chat with you a lot (but I am totally okay with this cos as I have said that I am quite shy) For those who want talkative stylists that will communicate well with you about how they treat your hair, or anything else, this salon might not be your choice if you are not Korean. From what I observed they all did treated Koreans or those who can speak korean well :) Second, good service because they also came and asked if we wanted some drinks:)

- Quality
So at last they didn't steal all my hair for sure haha! So I am quite satisfied already since I have no expectations for my haircut that I just want a haircut. However, at a third-person perspective, my boyfriend actually told me that my hair looks exactly like the photo I showed the stylist! This surprised me too haha!
For the hair treatment, my hair actually became smoother immediately! The treatment just lasted for around half an hour. After that, my stylist even asked me to touch my hair to feel the improved, different texture! One last note: I will come back again when I need another treatment or just a haircut:)
For my boyfriend 's haircut, he is also satisfied with his except the fact that they didn't clean the hair left on his neck. That made him quite uncomfortable at that time. But in overall, his haircut was done quite fast like an hour with quality. (His stylist is the same as mine)

- Price
Since they have Christmas discount, my haircut(plus hair wash) and a hair treatment costs $100 in total.

Lastly I just want to suggest that if you would like to go to this salon and have a try, just tell your that you are a visitor in Korea! (So that it is not a must for them to speak English in their ""own country"") Try to feel their culture at another perspective maybe you might find something fantastic or interesting :)",Beauty
mEwtubpA-HRWQ2m0Raut8A,cb8X0vmjeZZxaT1V6VOgfg,fDjKnECeU7s9lDnY23ntFw,2010-10-08,"The negative reviews are from disgruntled Cleveland Brown's fans.  As if their team wasn't bad enough, they have to take their frustrations out on a great local restaurant.  

In the mid 80s, as a member of the United States Air Force, I was stationed in England at RAF Lakenheath in East Anglia.  I was told that England was a great place to learn to play snooker or watch a Cricket match, but the food left a lot to be desired.  When I consider the traditional English restaurants, I would agree in most cases.  However, in an unlikely place, I found some of the best tasting food that ever passed my lips.  That place was the English Pub and the food was traditional fayre better known as 'pub grub'. 
I remember driving past the various pubs in Bury St. Edmonds, a small village not too far from the base, and slowing down to see the chalkboard specials and smell the  home-cooked aromas from doorways.  Without exception, I always stopped at the places that had the most tantalizing menu or beckoning smells wafting into the streets.  After a while, I knew which pub served what on any given day.  I made a habit of frequenting them, especially when I needed gastrointestinal relief from ""mess hall"" food.  I left England over twenty years ago not anticipating a longing for the delicious pub grub.
All of these memories came crashing down on me as I entered the Red Lion Restaurant and Tavern at 2127 Ayrsley Town Boulevard in southwest Charlotte.  My flashback was triggered when walking to the door and glimpsing the chalkboard with the day's specials written on it.  As the door opened, the memories intensified, as my olfactory glands were flooded with the eerily familiar emanation reminiscent of my time spent supping in ancient buildings with strange names like Ye Olde George Inn and The Fox and Hounds.  Other than the big open windows, omnipresent in American restaurant architecture, one is transported to a British pub.  In fact, their bar is retrofitted from a 250-year-old English church, which raises the authenticity level up more than a notch or two.   Combine this with a meticulous collection of old-fashioned furniture that has been collected from around the world, and surely the Red Lion is as genuine a pub as one can find this side of 'the pond'.  
A few things make the Red Lion uniquely American.  First, no pub I ever frequented had the plethora of television sets that don the walls of this beautiful yet unpretentious establishment.  Second, and most important, was our waiter, Action Jackson.  In England, traditional pubs are owned by breweries and managed by landlords or managers who typically live on the premises. I am confident this is the cause of the less than stellar service one receives while indulging their culinary curiosity.  Of course, most people do not frequent pubs for their service alone.  
Action Jackson is worth the price of admission.  He is entertaining, intelligent, and very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu and its dishes.  He loves his job and serving the patrons of the Red Lion.  This enthusiasm is reflected in everything he does, right down to the personal touches he adds to the dessert.  I recommend requesting a seat in Action Jackson's station.
The menu is a fusion of traditional English pub grub and American iterations of the same.  Although the shrimp and grits entree are never found on a pub menu in England, the way it was prepared and served creates the illusion that it could be a favorite among patrons of the Duke of Wellington in Southampton.  
I disdain grits.  It is a southern thing beyond my comprehension, right up there with fried okra and collard greens.  However, the shrimp and grits at the Red Lion are nothing short of heavenly.  Made with plump juicy shrimp, scrumptious chunks of bacon, mushrooms, lemon-butter, and fresh corn grits, I am confident I could be converted into a regular grit gourmand (provided all grits are made this way).  If you experience nothing more than the service of Action Jackson and the mind-blowing taste of the shrimp and grits, your trip to the Red Lion will have been worthwhile.
A favorite amongst traditional English pub regulars are 'bangers and mash'. If you are not familiar with the term, bangers get their name from the sausage's predilection toward bursting or ""banging"" open during high frying temperatures, and of course, mash is just short for mashed potatoes.  To the uninitiated, this may seem like a very odd combination, but at The Red Lion, your taste buds will dance with delight.  The Irish sausage used in preparing this dish is of the highest quality.  Sourced from a purveyor of fine gourmet foods, they are not available to just any restaurant.  The mashed potatoes are creamy and delicious, and when combined with the bangers, scallions and whiskey gravy, they are elevated to divine.  Although bangers and mash were one of my favorite culinary treats in England, none offered there provided the savory satisfaction as these.",Restaurant
n-gzR8mM4PRf8E5K-JfPCA,qs5lmdygjQGACmO9DbullA,0xk7iTNyprOmjrNhSCTZrg,2015-06-09,"As an AYCE place, this place is by far the cheapest during the week - $22 \/ person Monday-Thursday! They also have beer \/ drink specials that don't run you too much - usually around $3-5 per beer, based on what is considered the daily special. Make sure they don't overcharge for this though - the Canadian was supposed to be for $2.95, but I was charged $3.95 and was not corrected even after showing proof that it was posted otherwise. Only a dollar, fine, I let it go - but be careful nonetheless!

Traditional ordering system - pencil \/ paper. Different sections for different courses - rolls vs. appetizers vs. ""hot food"" vs. sashimi vs. sushi. Not great, but not a terrible way to order either. They only missed one thing we ordered! (Green dragon roll)

Miso soup was warm, but not hot enough to be enjoyable. Unfortunate, since I was hoping it'd be decent, but I came to an AYCE place, what the heck is wrong with me?

The sashimi selection and quality is pretty terrible - the tuna was basically still frozen when I was eating it (blech), but the portion sizes were expected and appropriate, given the order size. Further, they only have certain types of sashimi and other types of sushi - some aren't available in the other flavour. Weird!

Calamari was decent, but comes in threes - and in a pretty hefty size, too! Don't underestimate the deep-fryer - it was about 70% batter, 30% squid. Gyoza wasn't deep-fried - it actually tasted more like a traditional Chinese beef dumpling. Not terrible, but not what I was expecting. I guess I expected all AYCE gyoza to be deep-fried!

Hand roll was OK, wouldn't order again as it was too much rice, but decent quality if I had to recommend it (dynamite is the best type, as a sushi person).

Rolls were the saving grace here - and it wasn't the traditional types, either. The best ""value"" roll is the New York Roll, and here's why: It has masago, tuna, avocado, and salmon in it. The rice wrapped around it is so minimal it's actually almost unnoticeable! The downside to this, unfortunately, is that the rolls fall apart very easily when prodded with chopsticks - but I'll take that over an overstuffed roll with way too much rice any day of the week! Red\/Black\/Green dragon rolls you can't fail with, either!

Tempura (shrimp, mostly) was lightly battered and a good serving portion. Broccoli tempura and yam tempura are big - so be careful with order sizes! Beef ribs (Short Ribs) were of OK quality, but wouldn't recommend ordering too many, since they are inconsistent with sizes - some are massive, others are tiny. Yakitori (Chicken) are pretty decent sizes & quality, as is the eggplant.

Korean Sliced Beef dish was one of my all-time favourites - this goes for ANY AYCE place I've ever been to. It's a little spicy, so beware, but dang, it was an amazing portion size (about the same size as the amount of meat you would get in a main dish for a Korean a-la-carte restaurant), and of decent enough quality that I ordered another one to share.

Dessert selection is minimal - ice cream flavours are standard, plus ""rainbow"" (strawberry \/ mango hybrid), as well as ""deep fried milk"", ""deep fried banana"", and something else I totally forgot about, but wasn't worth getting, according to the wait staff.

TL;DR: Decent price for a decent meal. Would definitely come again!",Restaurant

And Marina I am very happy with this end result. It was heartbreaking to hear the technician say my couch was literally falling apart. The manufacturing company forgot to put springs in my couch and the frame is coming apart and put a hole in my wall. Mike stepped up made sure I was taken care of and took a lot of stress off my shoulders. I will be having a new couch delivered tomorrow. I recommend for everyone to purchase the additional warranty walker offers. It was our saving grace. Even if you never use it there may be a chance something terrible will happen. 
I do love walker furniture. I always will. One bad experience will not keep me away. I find it so hard to believe some other people that say no one ever contacted them regarding their issues. Mike called me back after every single time I called him. He went above and beyond and I appreciate everything he did to help solve my issues. 
If you need a sales person I recommend marina. She's very sweet, knowledgeable and really does care about her customers and their needs. 


Original:
Okay now I'm just beyond frustrated with this place. We have had the worst experience with this store. This all started back in 2\/29\/16. We were looking for a good furniture store at a decent price. I decided walker because I remember as a kid having the best experience. Here we are 21 years later and this store and the people that work there are not like I remember. Our first visit there was okay. Our sales consultant (marina) was very helpful and went out of her way to try to make everything go as smoothly as possible. Unfortunately nothing went as planned. After picking out a dining room set, book case, and chest. We found the couch we wanted. This was going to be the first Couch set I owned on my own. When we picked out the couch we went to put the order in. We were told they were no other couches available. At the time this was the only Couch they had within our price range and the correct size for our apartment. Talking about being crushed after looking for 3 days straight. Our sales person told us we could purchase the floor model. I was very hesitant on doing this because I seen a very large man flipping his two children on the couch from the back to the front doing back flips. I voiced my concerns to my sales person and a sales manager, both reassured me if anything happens they will work with us to have it looked at at a time that works best for us. I went ahead and purchased the set along with the other things. Now let's fast forward to July. I have no children and there are only two of us that live here but are barely ever home. One side of the couch started to sink alittle bit. I called the store spoke with a manager and he scheduled for someone to come out a week later. The same day this technician was supposed to come out I got into a car accident and texted the manager. I let him know I was just released from the hospital and would need to reschedule. He said no problem he would let the technician know. The technician showed up at my apartment any ways. I had to send him away because I was in no shape to be dealing with a person in my home when my husband wasn't home and I was supposed to be in bed. I called the manager again and let him know what had happened. he passed me off to the warranty center to reschedule. Every single time after this I spoke with them in august and September they told me they did not have any times available during Monday's and Tuesdays. I was not able to take time off work to have anyone to come out. Nor do I believe I should have to. I was told 4 different times there should be no problem with them coming out but that was never the case. I have to take this coming up Thursday off of work to have them come out to look at this couch now. At this point the left side of my couch is sunk in. Feels like I'm sitting on a bar if you try to sit there. The back of the couch has a huge hole in it, a piece of the couch is coming and put a hole in my wall. I just want to be done with this whole thing. Even if they come here look at the couch idk if there is anything they can do for this couch that was junk from the day we purchased it. We went back recently and looked at the couches again. We like one that we found but i don't know if I really want to keep doing business with this place unless they can do something to make this right for us.",Shopping

Away from the strip, and from Charleston Blvd. all you see is a small VG sign. I have to believe their success has been entirely word of mouth, and that should really say something as this place does not seem to be lacking in customers!

5 star atmosphere
3.5 star food
3 star service
=3.5 star review

I had been dying to try out Vintner Grill after hearing raving reviews. I just needed a good excuse to get dressed up and go out for a nice dinner - so when I got a new job offer, I decided it was time to celebrate, and what better place?

The decor of VG is very fresh, mostly white. White floors, tables, table cloths, walls, etc. The ceiling is white wainscot, which gives the place almost a country club, or Newport California sort of feel. Inside they have TV's playing Black and White old movies which adds a sense of class to the place. There were a few people in jeans, but no one in a t-shirt, and most everyone was fairly well dressed.

I love nothing more than wine, cheese and charcuterie so I was delighted to see a Formage and Carne menu with 3, 4 or 5 options. We opted for 5 selections ($25) and selected 3 cheeses and 2 meats. None of which were a let down. The cheese portions seemed small at first but went a long way with the accompanying bread and preserves! The best part of my meal here by far!

The menu had several wonderful sounding options - I had a hard time deciding on just one but went with the Halibut and Cous Cous because I hadn't had seafood in a while. I have to admit it was just ok... I was hoping to be blown away and I wasn't. The tomatoes were fresh and full of flavor, everything else was not. The lemon crust on the halibut left if feeling dry. I was disappointed, I will not be ordering that again. I don't recall the name of my date's meal, but it was some sort of shrimp pasta dish and he too said it was decent, but he too was wishing he'd order something else. Overall the food was good, but not great.

Our waiter was the biggest let down. He was nice at first, but then seemed put off when my date asked for a recommendation for a nice ""cheap bottle of red wine"". He pointed out a $60 bottle and my date said, ""I was thinking a little cheaper."" From this point on our waiter acted like we weren't worth his time. He rarely checked in on us, we once had to flag him down first to order our entrees and then again to ask for salt for the shrimp dish, and it was other staff who came by to refill our glasses of wine. I don't know what the average tab runs here, but all in all our bill was $130+ before tip so I felt we deserved a little better service experience.

I enjoyed the atmosphere and the Formage and Cheese so much that I will give Vintner Grill another shot, and hope for better service. I would actually really love to try out what looks like wonderful patio seating, once spring is here.",Restaurant
gSJZfBuSJTooRLH7inPAvg,4CArB4O-SIXgy1Ag4zbZYQ,J6ockj36gEvJ4VlmQr66-w,2015-02-25,"I have been meaning to write this review for a number of months.  I have been a student at G Skin & Beauty in Henderson for just under one year.  In this time, my impression of the school has gradually evolved from ""like it"" to ""love it!!""  Nobody has asked me or paid me to write this review! (Orig review written Nov 2014 but school changed Yelp listing, erasing all old reviews).

When I finally decided to earn my esthetician's license, I first attended a school in Spring Valley (won't mention the name but you can probably figure it out) without doing any research.  All I knew was that it was affordable and it was close to my home.  It was just horrible!  Please do your research before spending thousands and committing a year of your life!    There was a true lack of professionalism ~ between teachers \/ students ~ a terrible parking situation and a severe lack of proper, knowledgeable instruction.  It was just a crappy school all around, so I quit after about 30 hours.  Not letting my dream go, about six months later finally found another school with an esthetics program in Summerlin.  It too lacked many of the attributes I sought- however, I signed a contract and I figured ""just stick it out and get my 900 hours.""  We were without our text books three months after beginning school; no makeup kits, constantly without the necessary product to perform popular procedures on the public, supplies, you name it - the school was struggling financially which was confirmed by an abrupt closure \/ lock out in late December 2013 when the Las Vegas Constable changed the locks, essentially leaving 106 students without a school, as the owner did not pay rent.  After searching for yet another replacement school in Las Vegas I found that I had four options, and none of them were anywhere close in proximity to my home in Northwest Las Vegas.  My options were Aveda, Euphoria, Marinello, and G Skin.  Euphoria was the front runner until I found out that my tuition would be $3,000 more than G Skin & Beauty (and only the Summerlin location offered esthetics - however the Northwest location was planning on adding esthetics to its menu, just not anytime soon).  Euphoria, while more expensive, did not offer the schedule flexibility that G Skin seemed to offer.  Aveda did not seem to have a broad enough scope of instruction, focusing mostly on its own product line, not diving into microdermabrasion, etc.  (G Skin also offers laser skin care training in Arizona, it seemed more progressive than Aveda).  Marinello was never a place I wanted to go - seems behind in the times and a bit ghetto.  Now, after much consideration and disappointment, knowing the G Skin has been in business for 50 years out of Chicago IL .  I would have to drive over 20 miles each way to school, but my gut told me this was the right choice, all considered...and my gut was right!  There are two instructors at G Skin who wear the hats of esthetics instructors \/ management: w
The general manager is Saundra Carroll - a veteran of the beauty industry who is unbelievable knowledgeable about all things skin.  Ms. Saundra has worked in the medical field, has owned her own salon(s), and has worked for G Skin for over six years.  She is compassionate toward every single student, treats every person equally, and never turns her back or says that she doesn't have time to answer a question or offer her opinion when asked.  Any time I asked a question, she stopped and turned to me, looked me in the eye, and answered me in a way I fully understood.  Ms. Saundra is an incredibly talented kind and brilliant teacher and anyone who gets to spend time with her is very fortunate!  G Skin also provides its students with Mr. Paul, who is second in charge of the entire operation (from cosmetology, nail, as well as esthetics).  Mr. Paul and Ms. Saundra work very well together, and he too is super knowledgeable, helpful and truly cares about his students and always insures that we have all the tools necessary o be successful from our time at school, to preparing for the Nevada board exams to answering our questions, getting tests completed, you name it.  Ms. Saundra and Mr. Paul are excellent of defusing nonsense, which as you can imagine, is impossible to avoid in a place where 95% of the occupants are female.   
One last note: G Skin is the only place in Las Vegas that offers its esthetician students the ability to become certified through NCEA (National Coalition of Esthetics & Associations) which, to be brief, is an optional ""layer"" of education \/ studies \/ testing that actually turns what would be a 900 hour Nevada esthetician into a 1,200 hour esthetician through passing the NCEA test.  The certification gives an obvious edge over other candidates straight out of school, and throughout your esthetician career!  Love them",Beauty
XGXf-FV656hKcAO1tyKTzA,sup264L6tLGbzojn5bOOqQ,Q9v3zXGR2TduAKzn5B1BhQ,2013-05-20,"This is the second time I've visited with Dr. Aspacio.  I actually found him to be friendly and caring on both visits.  

Unfortunately, the rest was horrible.   Upon arrival for my first visit I asked the gentleman upfront to please make sure that my insurance would cover everything being done on this visit.  I said, ""I'd rather pay cash if it was not clear.""  He assured me we were all good and that he would make sure just in case.

Well, I had two moles removed and the Dr. was very concerned that they were cancerous.  Right, like UH OH.  He said he'd send the moles in for screening and they would get back to me.  This was at the end of the week and they would call me around Wednesday.  OK so I've had tests like these that made me nervous waiting a couple of days (thank God they all came back good)  Anyway, I'm a little nervous over the weekend.  Wondering what I do if I had cancer, etc.  Google searches and such made me feel alright if it was in fact cancer.  Long story short, Wednesday came and NO CALL.  Uh, hello, am I dying???  So I let it go til Thursday, no call.  Friday, no call.  Somehow I had some activity that weekend and it allowed me to sleep OK.  Well finally on Monday I called and said, ""can you let me know what my results were?????""  Thinking it was bad news cause they took extra time I was shaking.  The nice lady on the phone said, ""they never called you?""  Uh, whaaaat?  ""You're fine no cancer.""  WHEW...You can't let people worry like that.  Forgetting to call a guy who is waiting on cancer test is NO BUENO.

But wait, it gets worse!  Low and behold I get a bill in the mail.  I only check my mail once or twice a week as all my bills are on auto-pay.  Everything else is junk mail.  Thankfully I got this one.  Anyway, I called and just paid it.  I figured the extra procedures made it more money.  

So six months later I go in for a regular check-up.  I specificall ask the SAME gentleman at the front desk to make sure this was covered by my insurance as I DO NOT want any bills sent and me miss them.  I'd rather pay cash.  Everyone has been in a situation where you get some bill you thought insuranced covered and it the doctor sends it to collections.  He understood my concerns, apologized for last time and AGAIN assured me that just the office visit would be covered with my copay.  No problem.  They ask me to see their PA instead of the Doctor.  I was like,""NO, I want to see the Doctor.  He saw me before and I'd like to stay under his care."" Ok, no problem.  

Everything is good, no concerns I schedule to see him in 6 months.  

Today, I get a BILL for $12.26!!!!!!!!  I immediately call and ask to speak to someone.  I get transferred to a billing voicemail.  I hit zero.  A nice lady answers and then transfers me to the worst customer service person I've ever encountered.

His name is FRANK.  He said he doesn't give out his last name.  I told him exactly what happened and that I was ASSURED by the gentleman up front that this would not happen.  To be clear, the 12.26 is not the issue.  It is the principle of it all.  I could have had my credit marked up over such a small amount of money.

This guy could have cared less.  He told me there are signs all over the place and offered to read me the sign over the phone.  Really Frank?  Good attempt at trying to belittle a good customer.  I told him his representative EXPLICITLY ASSURED me DESPITE the signs posted at their reception.  Frank, maybe that's why I made sure to ask him this!!!!  He said his person should have never done this.  I said he did it twice.  And Frank asked me for my credit card number!!!  I said that is awesome customer service.  He said I am on the phone taking this call from an angry customer, that is customer service.  ""what else would you like me to do,"" Frank says.  I said he should honor the words and representations of his employee.  He said he's not authorized to do that and again asked for my credit card.  ""and then I'll transfer you to a manager.""  Whaaaaaaaaaat?  Frank isn't the manager?  Why I am talking to him?  What's his position?

I paid the $12.26 and Dr. Aspacio will lose me as a patient.  Additionally, I own two medical clinics that refers him patients all the time.  This will NEVER happen again.  It is a shame that a decent Doctor surrounds himself with people that cause him to lose patients.  The new world of medicine is coming Dr. Aspacio and with people like Frank working for you those with the ability to choose who they see will NO LONGER be seeing you.

Bottom line, I believe he is a good doctor who surrounds himself with HORRIBLE service staff.  I will no longer be coming back and will let everyone I know how RUDE Frank was and that there is a high probability your co-pay would NOT cover the visit.",Beauty
Q1haSKu4Bam0ArW9U1fWfQ,vqnGhHUU2srXlRIodoQDZQ,PLVGvzeCY7hqTLqHBGVflg,2008-02-13,"Isn't it simply lovely to be in the beginning stages of someone liking you and you liking them (I REFUSE to say the ""r"" word...)! It's even better  when you leave them for the weekend for a rather impromtu Vegas weekend with four of your most FAB gf's, and he calls ahead to get you WYNN SPA TREATMENTS. I think my heart just fluttered thinking about that. 

Clearly, the way to a woman's heart is not through her stomach (gross) or booze (mmm, except some Moet White Star...) or toys (read:good vibs) but actually by throwing some change down and getting her pampered. After a typical ridic evening in Vegas (see Libby L.'s earlier review for the dets), a spa treatment was seriously a god-send. Unfortunately, the process to obtaining said spa treatment was anything but.

Mystery Man #107 (yeah go with it, but don't assume its THAT number--I'm sooo less than half, don't worry, boys and girls) called ahead and had an 80 minute massage booked for me at 11 am on Saturday, complete with a male masseuse since apparently ""I like strong hands,"" as #107 proclaimed. Hmm, sure. So when two of us roll in to our 54th floor room at 6 am, I discovered the importance of phones in the potty: you can use them when everyone else is asleep in the other room! Sweet! Quickly dial downstairs, the spa is already open, and I ask to reschedule to a more bearable time. The woman gladly fixes it for me, but unfortunately only has a 50 minute window massage, would I like another spa treatment to accompany it with my remaining balance? YES. So no probs, got 1 pm massage, and a 2 pm facial.  Sweets.

But the sucky part is rolling my ass out of bed at 11:30 am (read:hangover), tripping over my darling girls' heels and eyelashes that are like everywhere (apparently these are simply GIANT eyelashes), to go downstairs into the casino to the ""Box Office"" to pick up my gift card thingy, because they can't just keep it at the spa. Dude. Not cool. I have to go back THREE TIMES for them to have it, and just make it to my massage on time.

[This is already becoming a journal\/blog (see Libb's great idea: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/blog-feature-on-yelp-san-francisco#hrid:Wf8U4bruJrR1tbdzbJY1sQ) so refer also to her beautious description of the spa below]

So the massage def receives 5 stars, the woman was spectacular. I have super sore forearms (read:S Factor) and she gave them special love per request. I felt simply amazing afterwards. And when I stumbled out of the haven of her massage room, I was able to see L, K, and V sitting happily in the jacuzzi room. It's so wonderful to pamper with others, isn't it? 

The facial is 4 stars, 1 minus for the fact that my nose was peeling for 2 weeks afterwards. Boo! But during the process, it was wonderful. She told me I took great care of my skin (high-five!) and to keep it up. My mother would be so proud. But with the massage all of ten minutes prior, and another dark room with cucs on the lids and gooey stuff all over, I'm afraid that I totally napped, right in the middle of facial (read:embarrassment). Opps. It just felt so good, and I was so relaxed! But luckily I don't think she knew, and it was only for a few minutes. 

So for lucky #107 to do all of that, he made me rather happy. Let all potential numbers (read:men) know that a great way to treat a girl\/worship her bod\/impress her friends and mother\/make her feel special is to do that. Otherwise, ladies, why even bother keeping them around?",Beauty
nIJbvOUp-oUmri0XlO16JA,RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ,YEh-PiExa0E3p71Nn56umQ,2012-07-09,"From check-in to check-out, Sanctuary Spa provides the ultimate spa experience. When it comes to my spa days, I like to choose wisely because I save my funds very carefully to treat myself to a spa experience. Because I save my pennies so carefully, I want an A+ experience at the spa I choose. Sanctuary gets an A+. 

I am going to be very detailed in my review, because when I'm looking for a spa I want to know every little thing about the spa. You will notice that the Sanctuary does an excellent job with the little extras that make a spa experience that much better. 

Setting:

The Sanctuary Spa is nestled on the base of Camelback Mountain. You enter through a plush neighborhood of beautiful houses and walk past state of the art tennis courts before entering the spa. I would call this spa intimate and state of the art. Yes, I've been to bigger spas, but bigger isn't always better. I opened the doors of the spa and entered a small check-in table where the staff greeted me with smiles and charm. They had me give them my CC upon arrival so that I wouldn't have to stop by and pay on my way out if I was in spa-mode. After check-in, they led me through double doors where two more spa attendants waited to give me a tour of the locker room and key to my own locker room. 

Ladies Locker Room 

The ladies locker room has everything I look for in a spa. It has a vanity area with lotions, hair spray, shaving gels, and several other products to use while getting ready. The bathrooms are spacious and offer mouth wash and disposable tooth brushes and toothpaste for use throughout the day. The private walk-in showers are also spacious and provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash and razors. The individual lockers offer a robe, flip flops and a towel. The jacuzzi is pretty small but on the quiet day I visited, it was just the right size. The waiting room for services is intimate but again, just the right size. They have hot tea, ice cold water, almonds and dried cranberries for guests to enjoy throughout the day. The ladies locker room provides the perfect setting for a relaxing day. 

The Gym 

When I do spa days, I like to take full advantage of every amenity they offer. After all, I am paying a pretty penny so I want to get my money's worth! I tend to visit the gym first because then I feel even better going into my spa day. This gym is definitely a nice one. They offer complimentary water and Gatorade at the gym. The treadmills overlook a lap pool through large floor to ceiling windows so it's easy to day dream while you workout. The treadmills have TVS and complimentary disposable head phones just in case you forgot yours. They also have ellipticals, weights, bikes and offer a variety of fitness classes throughout the day. 

The Pools 

I would say the spa lap pool is the only downfall (in my opinion) at the Sanctuary. During my spa days, I like to enjoy a tranquil pool that's not ""in the scene."" I like to saunter out there before and after treatments, lay out and relax. The Sanctuary spa does offer access to their two pools, but one is a lap pool without much ""spa"" ambiance to it. It's more just like a workout pool with some lounge chairs. The other pool is the stunning negative edge infinity pool in the main hotel area. The pool itself can't be beat and sits against a backdrop of the desert and palm trees. It was beautiful, but it was also in the middle of the action, so it made my spa day a little more rambunctious than I was hoping for. However, the pool itself was beautiful and I've definitely seen wilder pools. Just be prepared to be in the scene if you go. 

The Services 

Now let's talk services. I will say that my two technicians might be my favorite of all my spa experiences in the Valley: Sherry especially. Sherry gave me my Sanctuary Jewel facial which is a 50 minute facial that's customized to your skin. From the moment I met Sherry, she was so incredibly nice and made me feel at ease. She's Southern and her Southern friendliness definitely was in full force! Now, getting a facial can be nerve-racking because you are letting someone examine every flaw on your face. It's important that your technician makes you feel comfortable during the facial. Not only did Sherry make me feel comfortable, but she found traits to compliment me on throughout the facial and did it in a truly genuine manner. Not only was she nice, she gave me an amazing facial! I left with my skin glowing and my confidence still intact! For that I will continue to visit Sherry for facials. 

I had my massage done by Tara who did such a good job, I nearly fell asleep! Now be prepared for them to try to upsell you on products before the massage. That was the only downfall, but it's not the massage therapists fault for doing what they are told to do! I didn't add any extras, but the regular Swedish massage was all I needed!",Beauty
7QWwKgL52M3xphO0vqAoRw,IJHFqUUGEEwQ6_X-UIbIsg,f6CTsNX30XmC8siHWYV2bA,2015-08-23,"I will never be going to ANY foot spa after my experience here. Doesn't even deserve one star. 
My husband and I decided last minute to get a massage after our dinner date. Before I moved to Vegas I wouldn't even think about walking into a $20 foot spa, but living here for so long I've met so many people who go to these things on a normal basis. My grandma has a regular place she goes to, which is the last foot spa that I went too. The reason we came to this foot spa is because it was late and I didn't want to wake my grandma to ask her the name of her regular foot spa place she goes too, so we came to this one instead because it was recommended by a few of my coworkers who suggested it. 
So as we were walking to the door this not so friendly guy in an orange shirt was standing outside the foot spa and I think smoking a cigarette. The guy inside guides me to the private room for me and my husband. Two guys walk in, and the guy with the orange shirt who was standing outside was the guy who ended up being my masseuse. He did not wash his hands. His hands smelt and felt like cigarette smoke, I know because I could smell it as he started massaging my face first. 
I tried to ignore it because I didn't want to be rude, but I hate cigarette smoke so bad I couldn't handle it so I stopped him and tried to say as least offensive as possible (because I knew he had like 50min. Left to massage me), ""I'm sorry, but your hands smell like cigarette."" He didn't understand what I was saying so my husbands masseuse had to translate what I said. With no apology, he got up and washed his hands. He came back, said nothing, and began massaging me..EXTREMELY rough as if he was upset that I asked him to wash his hands. When he started massaging my feet and legs, he grabbed my ankles to throw my legs up to spread my legs more. I felt violated, and scared to say anything. I know that any masseuse knows never to massage a clients spine, or atleast be able to tell just by looking at someone how much pressure a person can handle, and if they don't know, then they atleast start off with less pressure. I'm 5'5 and weigh about 125. I know that even anyone who isn't a massage therapist would be able to tell that I could not handle the amount of pressure he was putting on me. He was also pushing down on my spine with his arm, but felt more like crushing. Same goes for my neck.  At the end of the massage he went out of the room to grab hot towels. He dropped it on my back and I yelled,"" oww"", from it being too hot, he then pushed the towel down harder onto my back. I know it sounds like something I should have spoken up about, and I know I should have, but again, I felt afraid. I have never felt that way with any massage that I've ever gotten, let alone with my husband laying right next to me who would have ended up going to jail if I ended up saying anything while We were there. Walking out of the room I already felt bruised all over my body. I couldn't bring myself to make any eye contact with the masseuse after. I just wanted to leave. Walking out of the room, there was a sign on the wall that said if I wasn't satisfied with my services that I would be refunded. As I walked to the front in pain, I contemplated complaining, but it was just so beyond having to pay that I just didn't even want to talk about it, or complain especially because the guy was standing right there waiting for his well underserved tip. Again, I just wanted to leave so I told my husband to give the guy $10, because I know if I give less they complain and I just didn't want to have to speak with the guy at all at this point. After we left I ended up crying the whole way home with my husband asking me what was wrong. I told him what happened and he questioned why I didn't say anything while we were there. Physically i was in pain, mentally I was afraid. I felt violated and overpowered the whole time after mentioning that his hands smelt like smoke, and with all that I was feeling, or trying to understand how I was feeling, I also didn't want my husband going to jail for battery that night. 
We went on Wednesday night, I worked Friday night. With my job I'm constantly on my feet, and that night it was very obvious that something was wrong with my back and neck from the massage I had gotten two nights before. I was in pain the whole night. 
After cleaning my house after a while, the same pain comes back. The last time I had back pains as bad as I do now was when I was 7yrs old in a bad car accident. I am now 24yrs old and I know the pain isn't from a car accident I had 17yrs ago. I would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE! Will never be getting this type of massage again.",Beauty
IFBwSd5R0zj8wIXTWvA5RQ,zcYi109YXVFhJtG0bTNZtw,AAthJ4E0qefuUKdNzeD7xQ,2016-10-23,"JOHN was my therapist, and he is absolutely phenomenal! He is very professional, knowledgeable yet friendly, appropriately funny, genuinely humble, and a great listener. This place gets 5 stars (very friendly staff and beautiful, clean, and quiet atmosphere), but it's John who bumps it up to 10 stars in my book! It was hands down (no pun intended) the best massage I have ever had, EVER, and I have been a regular to Western style massage my whole life. Thai Yoga massage is what my body has always been crying out for but never received over the years. Other types of massage (relaxation, Western deep tissue, and sports) only seemed to touch the surface compared to this. Nothing against Western style massage, but had I known about Thai Yoga massage years ago, I believe my quality of life would have been dramatically different at this point. I have had foot reflexology in the past, which I love too, but I never looked into Thai massage so didn't know what I was missing...a healing piece in my health puzzle.

I went for the first time today to get the 60 minute Thai Yoga massage and 30 foot reflexology after reading the great reviews about John. I suffer from several ailments, the main being Hashimoto's disease (autoimmune disease where the body attacks and destroys the thyroid gland) which leaves my body in chronic pain. So, I am often fatigued, and my muscles and joints hurt, ache and lock up. In addition I suffer from piriformis syndrome (similar to sciatic nerve pain) and migraine headaches. John, who was trained in his teens by his well-known therapist mother in Thailand, knew exactly each muscle and tendon to work. Another reviewer described him perfectly as the ""body whisperer"". So true. John knew exactly how to unlock my body and free it from my excruciating tension and pain.

SOME IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW & EXPECT: This type of massage may not be for everyone, but please try to keep an open mind if you are new to this. Thai massage is not Western massage where you go into a private room, undress, are massaged with oil over most of your body as the therapist hovers over the table. Thai massage is very intense, interactive, and cathartic because it involves being stretched (think yoga or even Pilates like exercises done for you) as you lay on a wide and firmly cushioned table. Your body is eased into many different positions using repetitive stretching and acupressure to release tension in your tendons, muscles and joints along their meridians, or lines. The therapist is mostly on the table with you, using their hands, arms, elbows, legs, and feet to press against these particular areas of your body while in these different stretched positions. You are laying down most of the time. Don't be intimated, I have never done yoga, only Pilates, but I felt very comfortable with the movements. This is an intimate type of massage due to them using many areas of their body as a tool to manipulate the pressure points, but keep in mind you are on the table fully clothed in a large, serene, and ornately beautiful room with multiple beds - a communal setting, meaning other people may be in there having their own session with a therapist. There is a light curtain available for some privacy. I didn't find this uncomfortable or off-putting either, but again, some may not care for this. Any pain or discomfort during the session can vary depending upon the exercise, your flexibility, health issues, and the level of pressure used. Always be sure to communicate with your therapist ahead of time to inform them of specific ailments and tender, problem areas so they are aware. Breathing deeply and exhaling during the stretches helps a lot, too. Remember, you are in control. If it hurts too much don't be afraid to let them know to ease up. It is also okay to make noises if you are in pain or discomfort as things are being worked and stretched. We are human, and no one will consider any one a wimp for working through any discomfort to gain relief. That's why we are there, right? 

At the end of my session I felt so rejuvenated, invigorated...and relaxed despite the painful process. It was a hurt-so-good kind of pain...not a bad kind of pain. Sometimes our system gets kinked up and can't function properly. For me, Thai massage un-kinked my system to flow more freely. The tension my body was holding onto was completely released...like after you emerge from an hour of exercise where endorphins are surging through your body...only better because you haven't been pouncing on an aerobics floor, banging your joints on a treadmill or grinding your knees on the elliptical. I felt very energetic for hours after my session, no nausea or grogginess as with other types of massage. I had minimal soreness until the endorphins wore off then it was time for a warm bath. I may be more sore tomorrow too, but it's all part of the process. It's all worth it. I will definitely be seeing John in the future for my massage needs.",Beauty
VWCp8b7iOc0yWNFp7F6PwA,B7K8AjW6MGDAP508KOfpAg,YqPcKy78Xog3JMy970D9bQ,2016-06-06,"I am not even sure where to begin with this ENTIRE experience. I scheduled an appointment a few months ago for an eye exam and the level of customer service and professionalism was awful. Day of my appointment it took them over an hour to even see me even though I arrived 30 minutes early. The women who was working the front counter that day stated it was her first day and told me that she DID NOT know how to charge my insurance. They charged me just under $100 that day for the exam and when I called my  VSP insurance they stated my copay should of been only $10 with my policy. VSP also informed me that they did run my insurance that day and received the full benefit. I am 100% positive that I was actually charged twice for my eye exam and that this was intentional. After being at this location for four hours I was finally finished and fitted with new lenses and sent on my way. 

I was told to wear these new lenses for a week and if I liked them to come back in and they would order them for me. I was not able to come back for a few weeks  because I not only work full time but I am also a full time student and after my eye appointment I realized very quickly that they do not value their customers time. Once I was out of school I called to schedule a new appointment and to order lenses and that is when an annoying experience turned to a bad one. I called early in the morning on a Thursday to schedule an appointment to order lenses and the young women who I spoked with scheduled me the same day at 5:pm. I had to ask my job to leave early that day and coordinate to have extra coverage at work so I could make this last minute appointment. 

I arrived at Visionworks right before 5:30pm that day and again waited for 10 minutes before even being acknowledged. I heard two guys laughing and carrying on in the back before one young man even appeared. (I was later told his name was Gordon). I told him I had an appointment and he told me that the doctor was already done for the day. I was obviously irritated because of the hassle I had to go through so I could even make this appointment and here this man is telling me I cannot be seen today. He told me to come back the next day. To make matters worse he was extremely rude to me and treated me as if I was inconveniencing him. I asked him for a copy of my prescription so I could go somewhere else since me wanting to order lenses is a problem. He refused to give me my prescription and said I do not have one saved in the system and then told me if I want a copy I have come back the next day. I was so mad I just walked out. I came back the next day again after work and asked to get the name of the rude guy from the previous day so I could report it and the two women working were very reluctant to give me any type of information. They had no concern about what had happened the day before nor did they care, they had the same, ""I don't give a shit"" attitude as Gordon. 

The doctor finally had time to see me but wasn't very friendly and made me feel like being there was interfering with him leaving. He finally gave me my prescription and immediately left the building. The women then took me over and looked at my prescription and wrote a few notes on a piece of paper telling me that she cannot order my lenses until Monday because they cannot order lenses on weekends. I assumed she would not do it by her attitude and the fact me being there meant she had to do actual work so I left with my prescription. 

A week later I called to see if my lenses were in yet and the guy I spoke to told me that there is no record of an order ever being placed. (At this point I am not surprised at all). This was actually good news to me because the last thing I want to do is give this company any more money after this. I thanked him and hung up. I called VSP to make sure they did not run my insurance for contacts since obviously I never received any lenses since they already charged me and my insurance for my eye exam. 

I happily took my business somewhere else and was actually treated with respect and received my lenses within a week!!!

If you are considering using this business for an eye exam I highly suggest anywhere else but this place. I read the other reviews as well and see that I am not the only person to be treated this way. Save time and hassle and find a real optometrist and support a business not run by assholes.",Shopping
-RH0_RnjqRrYaQYnBZkrbw,un2KUxPNvUOZDuUYoN-FQg,E94lGPASDOwEbbA3zvfxkg,2013-03-30,"I visited John last weekend after having done one too many burpees during my workout and was left with some lower back pain that barely allowed me to bend over. I found him on Yelp and the reviews sounded wonderful! I called on Friday afternoon and luckily John was able to get me in first thing the next morning. Amazingly, when I woke up the next morning, my back was about 90% better! Yippee! I thought about canceling the appointment since I was feeling so much better and saving the $$ but decided that since all the reviews were so fabulous on Yelp, I should go pamper myself a little bit. I have had a handful of massages in my life and I typically find massages just so-so regardless of the techniques. They always feel good but I've never been compelled to go back to a specific place because something felt incredible. I typically think a quick chair massage feels just as good to me as a full one hour massage. If I am going to go for a spa experience though, to me atmosphere is almost as important as the service so I really look for full experiences if I'm going to spend the money. 

When I arrived parking was plentiful since it was during the weekend and the studio is in a business complex. I must say, I would love to work in this building! Its very retro cool from what I saw on the short walk up the stairs to the second floor Space studio. It felt a little like something you would see in a movie. Maybe that's because I'm from the Midwest?

Upon entering, I met John in the front room of the two room space and he warmly greeted me and we discussed what had happened to my back and my lifestyle. This discussion felt much different than what you typically get at any day spa or high end spa for that matter and felt more more like a treatment of the whole person rather than, 'what hurts and what pressure do you prefer?'. The space is very calm and comfortable. It was a bit intimidating at first being at a massage studio with seemingly no one around in the whole complex, with a man you just met and you are able to disrobe but based off other Yelpers reviews, I felt comfortable enough to go ahead with the massage. 

The back room is where the table is setup and the design feels warm and welcoming. The table was very comfortable and all through my massage, John put towels or pillows under certain areas to make sure I was as comfortable and as relaxed as possible. As other's have mentioned, the hot towels are a nice feature of the massage and I enjoyed those a lot. Throughout the massage it felt like he used various technics to help that specific area which was a welcomed new experience. It felt like he was actually paying attention to what each muscle needed individually rather than a canned performance throughout that you get at most places. As a whole, I can say the massage was one of the best I've ever had. I will say having my toes popped was new to me during a massage, and in general, and I'll probably request that be skipped next time. The massage oil had a very subtle scent that let me get through the rest of my morning and afternoon running around town without having to feel like I need a shower so that was nice as well. 

After the massage, I talked to John about his thoughts between yoga and Pilates since I work at a desk all day and my workouts are usually high intensity interval training sessions. He thought yoga would be more beneficial since I'm only really in full body relax mode when I'm sleeping so I'm looking forward to taking some classes at a studio he recommended close by my place!

I think next time I'll plan a nice lunch at Postino's post massage with a glass of wine where I can enjoy my totally relaxed body. :)",Beauty

I am honestly ASTOUNDED that this business has only received ONE Yelp review to date. And not only that, but one review from SO long ago when so much has changed! So let's have a quick look-see so I can share with you why I'm so impressed:

FOR THE PEOPLE (THEN)

I first stumbled upon FOR THE PEOPLE while absent-mindedly perusing The Union at the Biltmore nearly two years ago. FOR THE PEOPLE was a very small boutique just behind the Royal Coffee kiosk, taking up about 500-sqft worth of space. It was packed full of seriously interesting objects - none of which I had ever seen before. Still, I remember flipping a few price tags, shrugging my shoulders, then moving on.

FOR THE PEOPLE (NOW)

Fast-forward a full year-and-a-half. FOR THE PEOPLE has now relocated to a standalone storefront just north of Camelback on Central Avenue, set right in the very heart of a budding Uptown Phoenix cultural scene. It's under new ownership and bears all the signs of a FULLY refined vision. It's new home is now closer to 3000-sqft worth of space in a mid-century building and every inch has been VERY obviously (and smartly) planned out.

The previously ""interesting"" inventory has been significantly updated to support a much more polished image with collections featuring a positive who's-who of the architecture, design, and art worlds. The store is also far easier to read and EXCEPTIONALLY well-managed by EXCEPTIONALLY knowledgeable staff and owners. I'm serious: it's INSPIRED. You should PLAN to learn something new every time you walk into this shop.

Product is sourced from local artisans and global makers alike, always with an eye toward providing an experience and curation of items that is at once sleek, modern, stimulating, and functional. There is nothing in this store to be overlooked. And the collections are always evolving! It really is like a new experience EVERY time you enter this store. A substantial amount of thought has gone into this concept and it is EVIDENT.

OTHER IMPORTANT NEWS

Since discovering the ""new-and-improved"" FOR THE PEOPLE, I have become a persistent regular. I have gotten to know the owners, Chad and Shawn. I have purchased several lifetime objects including a new minimalist wallet from local leatherworkers, Bison Made, and a machined brass pen from local artisanal brand, ATELIEA. And I have watched the store dramatically evolve since it's relocation.

The owners have been very strategic and purposeful in their use of the new space, bringing in STUNNING new handcrafted mid-century modern furniture collections from the Los Angeles-based Thrive Home Furnishings. Most excitingly (for this guy), they have teamed up with the wonderful folks at Kream Coffee to welcome a flagship location right there inside the store! There's even a walk-up window for us early birds.

In addition to ALL this, these guys host regular events featuring local hosts and almost-always locally-sourced food bites, beer and wine tastings, and even live music (not to mention delicious coffee!)! They've even just announced a new series focused on engaging lovers of architecture and design. This will be free and open to the public and offers REAL value to the immediate community in a wholly unprecedented fashion.

Keep an eye on their website for more detail about upcoming events. And Like them on Facebook! You won't want to miss anything this team puts on - believe me.

CONCLUSION

If you haven't been by FOR THE PEOPLE yet, you have GOT to go. Seriously. Make a trip of it. Grab yourself a yummy coffee beverage from Kream Coffee, then take your time perusing the gorgeous supply of modern design products and locally-crafted goods. You are SURE to be inspired. And believe me - you'll want to keep coming back, just like I do.

Oh! And if you HAVE been by the shop before: LEAVE A REVIEW! These guys have worked really hard to create something truly exceptional - something that offers legitimate value to its community. Let's blow them up with some Yelp love, yeah!?",Shopping

Day pass comes with in and out privileges and it is a good way to check out a spa before you commit to its services. Having been to other Las Vegas spas including Cosmopolitan's, Aria's is one of the best in terms of amenities and facilities not to mention an amazing view of the Liquid Adult Bar\/Pool and its music below.

Spa is adjacent to the pool area on the promenade. It IS a bit of a walk from the strip and in the back side of the hotel. Once you enter the spa area, you will see a reception area in front of you, a spa store to the left, and the salon to your right. Pay at the reception and you will be directed to the elevators at the end of the corridor. Walking to the elevators, you will pass by a very nice gym with great equipment which is also included as part of the day pass.

Take the elevators up to the spa. Once you arrive, wave your hand and the door will open for you. Spa has portions that are co-ed, but also has a separate men and women area that is clothing option. Upon entering, you will see a reception table and staff. They will give you a rubber band bracelet and a locker bracelet with your locker # on it. Staff will also give you a brief walking tour of the facilities. 

Here's how the co-ed spaces within the spa break down:

-Shio Salt Room: There are 6 orange lounge like chairs that have a slight vibration. Room plays relaxing music and the vibration from the chairs correlate with the music. Personally, I wasn't impressed with this room and the chairs were not vibrating that much even after adjustments. Lamps are made of salt and supposedly the air feels different. I didn't feel much of a difference.

-Ganbanyoku Beds: 6 heated ""beds"". I occupied 1 and was dreaming in spa heaven only to be interrupted by a snoring middle age man 3 beds down. Other than that, it was hot and helped me relax. Feels awesome after a plunge in the Infinity pool or jacuzzi.

-Infinity Pool (w\/partial view of strip, Liquid Lounge down below): This is a small, but awesome pool. During afternoon, you can enjoy the DJs from Liquid without the sweaty bodies in overcrowded Liquid! The infinity pool is relaxing. There are chaises and magazines on both sides of the pool along with two open showers. 

-Large Lounge Area: Huge space with comfy couches. Has magazines and newspapers scattered around the room.

Since I am of the female variety, I can only review the female side of the separate spa areas. 

They include:
-1 cold plunge\/jacuzzi 
-2 warm jacuzzis 
-1 red sauna room (not enough heat and no water in sight)
-1 mist room w\/eucalyptus in the area (lovely smell, refreshing indeed) 
-Women's only lounge area 
-Bathrooms, Shower Stalls, Multiple Sink Area

Amenities include (again for the female section):
-Inside Shower Stall: Shampoo, Conditioner, Shower Gel, Shave Cream
-Makeup\/Dry Your Hair Area
-Swimsuit Dryer: Doesn't dry the suit all the way, but takes water out. Located at the end of the sinks\/mirrors in bathroom area. Press down manually and make sure to stick the strap portion of your suit into the dryer first. 15-20 seconds dry time.
-Scale: To remind you of the indulgences from last night's buffet.
-Toiletries: Razor, Q-Tips, Shower Caps, toothbrushes with toothpaste on them already (just wet and it will activate), makeup remover pads
-Electronic lockers 
-Toto auto toilets (basic version of those fancy Japanese toilets)
Other Toiletries (Available, in a large bottle and or reusable with sanitizer): Hair spray, hair gel, combs\/brushes, bobby pins, blow dryer, facial cleanser, body lotion
-Iced cold face towels located by the jacuzzis and sauna\/steam rooms
-Robe (located inside your locker)
-Grey, waterproof, rubber like sandals (ah not fashionable, but hey!)

Now is the exciting part! REFRESHMENTS! I was impressed that they had a good amount of drinks to choose from. Many spas that I've been to seem to forget that the sauna and steam rooms themselves dry us out! Includes the following food\/drink items:
-Food: Nuts\/Trailer Mix
-Candy at Reception Desk (conveniently located by the gratuity envelopes)
-Fresh Fruit (Bananas, Apples)
-Bottled Water (w\/awe inspiring MGM global picture\/branding of all its resorts), Coffee, Ginger Ale, Orange Juice, Cranberry Juice, Dole Pineapple Juice, and Izze. 

Cleanliness: Not all the food\/empty bottles were picked up right away. Some hair in the makeup room and shower stalls. Couches and sitting areas were for the most part clean.

Volume: This could be improved. Some of the guests were very loud including two European gals by the jacuzzis. I couldn't figure out what they were talking about other than they were arguing and it woke me up from my cat nap on the chaise. 

I would go back again and it is a great way to end a long day or trip especially if you are flying out of Vegas late and have a few hours to kill!",Beauty
5iXbn-iqNnEVhnDg6BoChg,IhY66GZIeA9jTjwPRVhpLQ,ZjSzUWHtnpCfjsa7CksSOg,2015-06-30,"I have been a loyal customer of the Signature at MGM Grand since they opened in 2006 when I had the pleasure of meeting Frederic Luvisutto, and often return to your property several times a year.  I've also convinced my colleagues to stay at The Signature while attend conference in Las Vegas.  I have time and again received great service at your property which is one of the main reasons I continue to stay at The Signature when I'm in Las Vegas. Andrea, the bartender in the Signature Lounge has been very pleasant and accommodating the last 2 years. 

I prefer a higher floor with a view of the strip therefore, took advantage of your High Floor upgrade for $75.  Additionally, I prefer a seamless check-in process and when I realized The Signature offered VIP Check-In for $80, I quickly took advantage of that service.  

This is where the unpleasant experience started.  I did not receive a pre-arrival phone call from the Concierge which didn't concern me as I had already emailed them about obtaining tickets to ""O"".   To my surprise, when I arrived at The Signature, Tower #2 on the June 22nd 2015 @ 1pm, I was at the receiving end of some disappointing service or rather, lack of service.  I was not met curbside by a member of your staff at Tower #2 and there were no bell staff  present to assist with my luggage.  I proceeded in to the lobby and after a few minutes, I was assisted by one of the Front Desk staff members.  During the check-in process, she advised me she removed the charge for the VIP Check-In but, did not offer an explanation for service mishap.  I was also advised my room would not be available until after 3pm, my suite would be in Tower #3 and if I wanted to check my luggage, to go out the front doors, turn right and see the bell staff.  Additionally, I was advised that ""I"" would need to call the main phone number to determine when my room would be ready as, she was going ""off work"" at 3pm.  

It had been my intention to check-in to my room at 1pm, unpack as I had a 4pm reservation at the   Mandarin Oriental Spa. Since your property completely dropped to ball on the VIP Check-In, I elected to proceed to the Mandarin Oriental Spa early.  The service at the Mandarin Oriental is always outstanding and when I had arrived early, they were able to assist me with an additional spa services for my guest and myself.  My bill was $750 for an afternoon of relaxing spa services.  

After I had dinner with one of my local friends and arrived back at The Signature around 8pm to pick-up the keys to my room.  I don't care for Tower #3 due to the long walk to the MGM Restaurants.  When I spoke with the Front Desk employee (Jina), I ask if the manager could provide an explanation why my request for VIP Check-In was ignored.  She advised she would leave an update in my portfolio for the manager. I never received an explanation and felt my request, which I was more than willing to pay for was just, ignored.  

Now, I was still expecting to receive the additional services offered with the VIP Check-In including daily ""turn-down service"" which of course never occurred.  On Tuesday, June 23rd, I left the room between 1:30pm ~ 2:00pm but, housekeeping did not clean my room or deliver any bottles of water.  On Wednesday, June 24th one of my local friends arrived at Tower #3 @ 8pm as we were having dinner at Craftsteak @ 9:30.  When she arrived at Tower #3, the valet (an Asian gentleman) advised her that valet parking was for Signature Guests only.  I must point out that, I did not park a car at The Signature, why could she not utilize my parking?  I had to come down, speak to the valet and he then allowed her to park her car.  Additionally, I had this same issue with this same valet last year.  Was this really necessary?!?

I was willing to pay $155 for extra services (VIP Check-In & upper floor upgrade) and therefore, was expecting a certain level of customer service that clearly did not occur.  Was this level of service consistent with the MGM Resorts core service standards and brand attributes?  Could you please provide me with some rationale why I should continue to utilize your property and not start utilizing the Mandarin Oriental or the Wynn (I believe Frederic Luvisutto is now the CEO), both properties provides an outstanding level of customer service?",Beauty
mLnNMGlpfuKJ-aDHFEkY2Q,ZHp6HNV69DOE80-fCRG4Lw,ARWTnr4lAWocZVkrV077Ag,2015-07-22,"To be honest, and with great sadness, this was the worst salon experience I ever had (and I love to experience different salon and spas). I am new to town and really thought I did my research well in finding a great, friendly, experienced, skilled salon and stylist; but opps I was so wrong. I had actually saw a Groupon for this location with Nicole Acker as the stylist; and after researching, thought it was a great place and a great deal. The Groupon was for a ""Shampoo, Conditioning Treatment, Cut, and Style"". After weeks of trying to get a hold of her to schedule an appointment (purchased on June 9th called every week to find a time and finally had one set on July 16th). I arrived at 2:55pm since I had it down my appointment was at 3:00pm. When I walked in I was rudely greeted ""Can we help you"" (no friendly ""Welcome"", or ""Hi, how are you"" or smile); then, Nicole came up and said appointment was at 3:30pm not 3:00pm. I apologized for the confusion on my end and said no problem I could wait as I had some emails and things I could do while waiting those 30 minutes (truly no big deal). However, she had no one else there when I arrived and had no one else come in before my time. Instead she went to smoke outside and when she came back in around 3:15 she called me back and we started the process (she didn't even wash her hands from smoking and the whole time I smelt cigarette fingers in my hair, ew). So as I sit down she asks what I want done and I state I would like a very minimal trim and just to have my existing layers touched up. She proceeds to tell me it's best to do my trim with dry hair and not to wash it first .... (Never have I ever had my hair cut while it is dry and I had told her my hair was 'dirty' from not washing it myself since it was included in the package I purchased, but she didn't care and said it would help take just the minimal off. I nervously said okay, since she is suppose to be the professional, and hoped for it to turn out great. . . . obviously not). So here she is snipping away at my hair that is not fresh and therefore not laying evenly at that moment and ends up taking off about 3-3.5 inches (YIKES)! I said TRIM :( !!!! Not to mention, the layers were poorly snipped as well leaving my hair choppy looking. Unfortunately, I have a photo shoot coming up and now my hair is too short for some of the ways I planned to wear it which made me even more upset. I have always had long hair down to the middle of my back and now its barely passed my shoulders. Not to be over dramatic, because truly hair does grow back, but, it looks terrible and even worse in a ponytail (which I rock that style often). But, back to the actual experience in the salon. . . I didn't even get a shampoo or conditioning treatment when she was done with the cut. She did ask if I wanted a straightening style but I was too upset to even sit there and let her do that, plus I now had to go wash my hair myself so it would be pointless to style. Also, if you recall I sat down with her at approx 3:15 and I was out of there by 3:30. WHOW world's quickest 'luxury' salon experienced I have ever encountered. I am truly a very polite and nice person who tries at all costs to keep peace and a friendly face so I couldn't speak up and say something because I would feel bad, but looking back I really should have. I mean I did pay for a service I didn't receive; but who wants to upset someone messing with your hair, especially not after it's already not going well! Not that saying something would have changed my cut and neither will this post, but I just hate that it happened. I am so particular about my hair and take pride in it, but now that is gone, at least for a while. Bad haircuts are so aggravating and I wish I could just rewind the experience, but now I just need to suck it up and patiently wait for it to grow. I truly contemplated even writing this because I know it doesn't make it better or change anything (and again I don't like the be the bear of bad news) but if anyone is like me they do research before trying some place new and obviously the research I read wasn't accurate so I want to prevent this from happening to someone else and wish them luck.",Beauty
E_QLoDLswxE_CBbYxSRNiA,BxoHYTzq0A1AlvEs1Sj00w,ad0LjmuXhUGBxTSkve5LZA,2010-08-26,"Beaver Choice.  Let's just get this out of the way.  I don't know what the name means, I have no idea why it's named that, I don't know why the logo is a beaver (the animal kind - get your heads out of the gutter people) in a Swedish triple crown shirt holding a fork.  With all that said, what I do know is this place is definitely worth a try.  

I had never heard of the place until my girlfriend fiancée sent me a link saying we should check it out sometime.  I checked out the menu online, it looked good, so rather than wait several weeks for my fiancée to have a free lunch period, I decided to investigate for myself that very same day.  Good move on my part.  

It's a great little Scandinavian restaurant that's only been open for a couple of weeks in a pretty non-descript suite in the strip mall behind Ted's Hot Dogs at McClintock & Broadway.  It's a very clean place with about 6 or 7 four tops, furnished from top to bottom by...you guessed it...Ikea.  It's a family owned and operated spot and they are some of the sweetest people you will ever meet.  They are very proud of their little piece of Scandinavia in the desert and it shows in their service and their food.  

They are well aware of the fact that with the exception of Swedish meatballs, most people aren't really familiar with Scandinavian food so when you approach the counter, right off the bat they ask if you would like to try a little sample platter free of charge.  Who's going to turn that down?  I had a little piece of Gravlax (raw salmon cured in salt, sugar and dill), some potato salad and some pink lunch salad thing the name of which I forget.  I really enjoyed the Gravlax and potato salad but the pink one was made with sour cream and since I've never been a fan of sour cream I only had a bite of that one.  

They have two menus. One could best be described as a lunch\/to-go menu and one that they call the bistro menu which is essentially akin to a dinner menu except that you can get anything on it all day.  They have salads, wraps, sandwiches, soups, entrees, etc. with all kinds of different varieties of meats to choose from.  They even had two that they say on the menu are recommended for hangovers.  My kind of place! It all ranges in price from about $5 for sandwiches and wraps up to about $15 for a couple of the full sized dinner entrees though most of the dinner entrees mostly hover around $10 which is a steal for the amount of food that you get.  

I decided to try the schnitzel.  It comes with a decent little side salad with your choice of either a honey mustard or garlic vinaigrette, a little citrusy red cabbage slaw both of which were good but were primarily there to compliment the main event which was the schnitzel.  It's an enormous breaded pork cutlet stuffed with ham and brie cheese, cooked to perfection and topped with an amazing mushroom gravy and on the side were dill mashed potatoes also topped with the gravy.  Both of them were in a word, delicious.  It was about $11 for the whole entrée and it was worth every penny.  I wasn't able to finish the whole thing but I can tell you that it keeps really well because I had it for breakfast this morning.  

I haven't tried anything else on the menu but if any of it is even half as a great as the schnitzel, it's gotta be pretty damn good.  

You know how every now and then you go to a place that's just starting out and you get great service and great food and you just hope that they make it?  Well this is one of those places.  I strongly suggest that you go check it out.",Restaurant
Un5I68apV0RNW_5V_TmM2Q,twap2vbTOap_1uwZfXJrMg,DTbJcFX3m0wtFjppf-ZmUg,2013-05-16,"I got married in September of 2012 and used this salon for myself and my bridal party. I chose this salon, because it was the only salon I could find in the area that had a bridal package. I'm originally from Strongsville, but I have lived in Columbus for 10 years. In Columbus there are chain salon\/spas that provide excellent hair, makeup, and spa services, so I was shocked at how hard this was to find in the Cleveland area.

I had been to this salon one time before to get my hair done for my best friend's wedding. It looked okay. Not great. Not terrible. I didn't really put a whole lot of thought into how I wanted my hair done for her wedding. She and another friend of mine go to the same girl at this salon regularly to have their cut and colored.

I called and made my appointments for my trial hair\/makeup, my mani\/pedi the day before the wedding, and my wedding day hair\/makeup. The day before my trial hair\/makeup, I received a phone call from my friend whose wedding I was in years earlier, saying that she got a reminder call for my trial hair\/makeup appointment. Although I gave them my cell phone number, they still had listed her phone number from years earlier. No big deal, but annoying.

I had to pay for the entire package that morning, so I did so. Then I made appointments for several girls in my bridal party. They quizzed me about how long each girl's hair is. When I told them my mom's hair was medium length - a little past her shoulders - they rolled their eyes and me, got snippy, said that that qualified as ""long"" and made me go back through each of the other girl's hair length.

When I sat down for my trial hair, I showed my stylist two pictures - one of beachy waves and one of a loose updo. She seemed irritated that I hadn't nailed down one specific style that I wanted. She got huffy and said that she would do the down look first and then the updo. My beachy waves turned out to look like Curly Sue with weird knots in the back. It was terrible. I prayed that the updo would look better. It didn't. When I told her that it wasn't how I wanted it, she said that it was my fault because I wanted to try two looks.

Then I sat for my makeup. The girl only talked about herself and how wasted she got the night before the entire time. I showed her pictures of a Revlon ad with Emma Stone wearing light, peachy colors. I ended up looking like a 90's hooker with dark eyes and brown lips. 

I left that day in tears, but what was I going to do? I had already paid and there was no where else to go. 

I called a couple weeks later to add another bridesmaid that decided she wanted to get her hair done too. I gave them my name and phone number and they insisted that they had no information for me and no wedding appointments scheduled under that name. I nearly died. At this point it's only a couple weeks before my wedding, which is taking place over Labor Day weekend and even small salons would be booked solid by this point. As it turns out, after spending 20 minutes on the phone arguing, they still had my appointments under my friend's phone number. Nice.

I went in the day before the wedding, and got my manicure and pedicure. The tech was wonderful. She was friendly, and asked me questions about my wedding, and did an absolutely fabulous job on my nails. Truly a silver lining in a very dark gray cloud. Although, while I was there, I noticed the girl who did my makeup and she was doing another girl's makeup exactly the same as she did mine. Apparently she has that ""one look"" she does and that's it. She was also boring that girl with stories of her partying.

The morning of my wedding should have been wonderful. It was not. I sat down for my hair, and the stylist was rude and inpatient with me. My stepmom was getting her hair done next to me. Afterwards, she looked exactly the same, except with a big curling iron burn on her forehead. Thankfully, my stepmom is a very easy going person, and came over to see how my hair was coming. When my stepmom suggested that my stylist pin my bangs back instead of just tucking them back behind other hair, she yelled at her. She actually yelled at my stepmom. On my wedding day. While we're all paying an arm and a leg to be there. FYI - later in the day, my bangs did come undone, and they look terrible in all of my pictures that I paid 3 grand for.

Next up, my makeup. I went to the Clinique counter the week before my wedding, and bought lipstick and an eyeshadow palette so that she'd have to use the colors I wanted. She refused! She proceeded to do the exact same look that she did at my trial - hooker chic. I ended up taking most of the makeup off when I got home and redoing it myself.

The only person who had a good experience was my sister-in-law who ended up with the girl both of my friends go to.

I kept telling myself that this salon was better than nothing for my wedding day, but in retrospect, looking at my wedding photos, I think I'd have been better off with nothing.",Beauty

David Burke.. hmm, I want to say I'm a fan with a little more meaning behind it. However the service and some of the menu staples it's continues to offer leave me less enthusiastic then I could be. 

Came here on NYE after waiting until that day to go on open table to see what was available. Having dined at the NYC location and wanting a redo, we chose to come here. I'm for the most part, glad we did. 

The restaurant itself is considered ""high end"" however, it's not stuffy and I would actually go so far as to call it whimsical in it's decor. Lot's of egg art everywhere, a fountain operating from the ceiling serves as the room centerpiece and falls onto what I think is red glass grass. It's cute! 

The welcoming staff is very friendly and got us off to a great start. Our server however was either very friendly or annoyed and rushed. Considering the restaurant wasn't completely full, he really should have been a bit more attentive and had a better attitude. I'm sure working on NYE sucks and when your 20% gratuity is included maybe you figure ""WTF, I'm going to get paid regardless"" but if you don't like what you do, then maybe it's time to I dunno.. go deal cards or whatever else you can do in Vegas. 

The Food:

We started off with an amuse bouche of butternut squash soup. When the waiter put it down I thought ""oh great, i hate squash"" but I tried it anyway, and surprise it was very tasty! Rich, creamy, sweet and all that good stuff. 

Bread followed. I love their bread, it's very *comfort food* and yummy.

Chestnut Soup: Ok, when I had this I wasn't wowed, but now I kinda want it again lol. I guess it was just ""different"" and I was taken aback too much to love it. It was creamy and sweet.. which seems a theme here. It kinda had an ice cream background type flavor to it. I'd get it again.

Pretzel Crab Cake: I've had this before in NYC and my dinner date got this. He said he enjoyed it. I guess I did too, but I don't get why they keep it on the menu and so many people order it and rave about it. It's good, but not amazing. And it also had what I consider a theme-y sweet taste to it.

Truffle Fries: my daughter was to have these as her appetizer, but they never came. Even tho we specifically said ""she'd like those as her appetizer"" they thought we wanted them with our dinner. Not cool :\/ They brought them.. late, and then somehow the kitchen still thought we had the dinner order coming, so we ended up with two orders. They're uuuum pretty much fantastic so I wasn't complaining about having extras lol! 

Dinner? Ok, so the waiter read off the specials and the whole Maine lobster, done lazy style and served on top of truffle garlic mashed potatoes sounded great so we ordered this. What the waiter failed to mention was they were 3lbs a piece! Both my friend and I are not big people lol.. obviously with what we'd already eaten there was no way we could ever eat that much lobster. We could have easily split one special and been satisfied. I barely ate half of mine.. probably closer to a quarter. It was such a waste of food and at about $135.00 a piece a waste of money, I felt bad. The special BTW was fantastic.. the lobster was delicious and the potatoes were very flavorful and tasty. It was a simple, but well done dish. It came with a mass amount of butter tho.. check the pics lol!

My daughter had grilled salmon, which she finished and enjoyed lots. She said ""it's not fishy and it tastes really clean"" .. that's the word on that :)

We skipped dessert because obviously we had already had more then we could finish. I've has their trademark cheesecake lollipop tree at the other location and it was eh, ok.. another thing I don't see the big deal about.

Cocktails: Hibiscus Royale.. so yummy! It was a mix of champagne, and some sweet stuff.. duh, that's a ""royale"" lol and on the bottom there was an edible hibiscus flower. i didn't eat the flower, but my friend said it tasted like a fruit role up. 

All in all, it was a very good, not great experience. The food was for the most part excellent, the service could be better, and the setting is upscale yet fun.",Restaurant

Second time eating here, and second time the order was messed up. Not going to be a third time for a ruined meal experience. Too many choices in this city. 

In Depth Review: Decided to eat here on a Sunday in late April. We arrived to Red Rock at 12pm and the place was slammed. There were easily 300+ people waiting in line for the brunch buffet (shocking). We were taken back to find that there was even a line for the Grand Cafe. Even had the velvet ropes set up that you would find at a busy Vegas nightclub (ridiculous). After a 10 minute wait we were sat. Waitress took another ten minutes to greet us and take our drink order, we over looked that and she seemed nice. We placed our orders, nothing crazy - Eggs Benedict, Mediterranean Egg Frittata & Short Stack Pancakes (side). 

So the wait begins, almost an hour after we placed our order, 45 minutes after the butter and syrup was brought to the table, the plates arrive. The eggs Benedict is ice cold, the hash-browns on the side undercooked and mushy. The Mediterranean Frittata was cold, the English Muffin on side Luke-warm. The only item up to par was the pancakes. So we were a little upset, and asked for them to please remake the eggs and serve us hot food. Cold cooked eggs is not what we wanted. The waitress said the kitchen was slammed and that the manager was helping plate the items and that she would speak with them. She also suspected that the pre-poached eggs Benedict was to blame. They are NOT cooked fresh to order apparently. 

The female manager came out about ten minutes later to apologize and blamed it on 600 people checking out of the hotel at once. Said she would comp a round of drinks for us for our troubles (whatever). So we placed a drink order with waitress, guess what? That was also messed up. Sent over a drink we did not even order. We are having some bad luck, it was becoming laughable. Then the food comes out, and the Benedict is still not cooked properly, and the side of hash-browns is still undercooked and mushy. The Frittata was fine but my appetite was gone. At this point we just asked for the check. They comped the round of drinks (big deal). We paid, still left a nice tip (waitress was very pleasant) and promptly left. 

Side Note: Our first visit to here was mid-week, about a month ago. The restaurant was empty on that visit, somehow the waitress ordered me food that I did not ask for. It was an honest mistake and they corrected it. It still demonstrated that they have some issues to deal with at the Grand Cafe. 

In Summary: We were willing to overlook an issue with our first visit and give it a second chance. After yesterdays poor showing, there will be a third visit here. Like I said above, there are way too many options in this city. 

Hopefully Station Casinos will take notice and make corrective action. Especially after reading the other poor reviews online. They are not the best, and what a beautiful casino like Red Rock should be comfortable with. It's a nice restaurant and has potential. Right now it's not living up to the standards of this resort.",Restaurant
pluduTlwWiZn4zXkWBK1LQ,WeVkkF5L39888IPPlRhNpg,FJY3WbrP1UFPJaG_87kNdA,2017-03-24,"Safe to say after reading some of the earlier reviews, that Hank Daddy's has overcome their initial new biz hurdles and is now in the ""killing it"" era of their business cycle with no end in sight. 

BBQ has become latest trend to hit Vaughan and with spots like Hank Daddy's leading that charge I anticipate many copy cats will soon follow. 

Having a meeting in Vaughan was cause enough for me to pay them a visit - even though my meeting was at Hwy 7 and 27 (HDs is at Keele, so couldn't be further away) but like a good 905oodie I didn't balk at a drive to get good eats. 

HD's is located around the corner from National Sports at Keele and 7 and they've taken up an amazing corner location With lots of parking, great access from main roads and a huge indoor space. Walking in I felt like this spot was part restaurant, part backyard cookout. String lights hung from the ceiling with care above a mix of standard and picnic style tables. 

The crowd at lunch was packed with business types in groups stealing away from their boring bagged lunches to come have a cheeky meaty splurge (and subsequent meat coma) at Daddy's place. 

Being a first timer I took a long hard look at the wall sized menu... and got lost. I wanted all of the things. All of them! So I got to the front and asked for help... please. The gal at the cask was a rockstar, she walked me through it and as we went explained some easy combos and ways to get the most for the least. She also tempted me with their signature pulled pork sundae\/parfait (pulled pork, mashed potatoes in a sundae glass). Amazing. 

After some deliberation I settle on the pound of smoked wings (spicy) with a side of MacNchesse then for $9 added 3-4 pork ribs on the side AND used their Yelp check-in offer for a free side to grab some corn bread and really max out my order. 

Ok I'll need a breather for a second here because I just got super excited reliving what I'm ABOUT TO tell you so gimme a sec...........
........ ok I'm ready! 

To start let's warm up with the sides. Previous reviews stated insufficient portion sizes for the MacNcheese and that it was dry. Not the case any longer. The side was nearly a meal on its own a hearty sized bowl of super moist and cheesy noodles (see my picture for suspended cheese pull imagery haha). The corn bread was next and it was lovely, the perfect accompaniment to all the sauce on the ribs. It was nice and moist and not even a little try (read: no unnecessary crumbling!). 

Next up, the back ribs, done in the Hand Daddy's original sauce. You wanna talk about fall off the bone? As I picked up each rib I needed to be careful as to not wiggle the bone too much as the meat was barely hanging on. I could have had no teeth and been totally fine gumming these to death. Melt. In. Your. Mouth. Yum. Not overly sauces either which was great so you still got some of the smiley meat flavour through the sauce (which had a hint of maple syrup surprisingly through all that BBQ smoked goodness). 

I love the ribs, but the chicken wings? Totally knocked me back on my ass. Wow. Everything about these was executed beyond perfection. First off they were a great size easily the size of 3-4 of the baby wings you get at place like Wild Wing (seriously how are they still in business and growing). Next they were slow cooked, so not unlike the ribs they too were falling off their bones. And with that slow cooked smoked flavour paired with their dry rub season and their spicy sauce I think in the debate of who came first the chicken or the egg.... it was me. Get it? Yeah they were that good y'all. 

I honestly had to stifle my audible ""mmmm's"" and soft groans between bites because I know I was getting hella awkward while eating. 

It was an amazing meal, and for some reason HDs blends of spices and sauces go unbelievably well with a tall pint of Steamwhistle pilsner (available on tap here). The pilsner acted like a palate cleanser and really brought the meal to another level. 

I'll definitely be back with my Yelp friends in tow. If you haven't been or have been thinking about going here, do it. Do it now. Line up if you have to. Once the word of Hank starts to spread anticipate line ups and wait times... but always amazing food. 

Also say hi to Hank Daddy himself, he'll be the super friendly dude in the full brim hat cooking in the back and coming out personally to check out how your meal is going.

uufSTx1EsZJoK7YjrAJ-iA,Y7EkNdRl_WCML9zo9lw1nw,TTu3UP6mKWJ3kY2RSKk79g,2017-04-03,"I got a wax pass last year and came here about once every 3-5 weeks. While my experience was a 3.5 in regards to how I was treated at this location and the appointment availability, there were a few things that brought the score lower overall.

The reason the rating started at a 3.5 was because I don't feel that this company cares about their customers. I noticed this when they switched from calling you to confirm your appointment to the automated system which didn't work.  Now I take full responsibility for not putting the appointment in my phone or planner, but I was used to them calling me the day before for 4 months and was never told that they were switching their practices, which was annoying. I got a call a couple hours after I missed the appointment and told them I didn't get a confirmation call to which their response was that I did and I answered for about 30 seconds and then hung up. I looked at my phone history and didn't see a single call from an unknown number that day. It was only one miss out of the 3 so it wasn't a big deal, but I wanted them to know that their phone system was having an error so I called corporate and left them a voicemail. 5 days later and no returned call, so I tried again. They called me 2 weeks later and I missed the call so I tried back 3 minutes after a voicemail was left. I left another voicemail as well as a message with an assistant, but heard nothing back. I find it unacceptable that when a customer calls a company to inform them of a problem with their system they don't make the time to get back to them with a response. The error was resolved, but they lost my trust in their company.

Something that brought the score another point down is their inability to retain waxers. I'm not a shy person, but when you get a Brazilian every several weeks, it's nice to have someone you are familiar with and trust doing it. Someone you know does the job correctly. 4 girls that I started going to ended up leaving over the course of 1 year. They all left after a couple of months of being there. They never said anything bad about euro wax, but I could always sense there was something that they weren't telling me. On my last visit 1 month ago, my most recent waxer told me she was quitting. Since my pass was ending I decided to start looking into other salons.

Fast forward to a week ago, I find a place that I want to start going to and I make an appointment. She does soft waxing unlike the hard wax that I had become accustomed to. I did soft wax for about 1 year before hard and her rate was awesome so I figured that the pain was worth it. In the middle of my wax she asked if I had ever gotten a wax before. I thought I was doing well with the pain tolerance so I asked her why she would think that, after all I've been getting a wax every several weeks for the past couple of years. She showed me the used strips and how the hairs she had pulled had full bulbs on the root. She told me that when someone waxes as frequently as me, their hair is much finer and that the bulb doesn't have time to regrow. Basically I learned that I had been paying $600 a year for a painful trim as the hair was not being fully pulled out.

Things I liked about euro wax: they have locations all over. When I went to visit family in CA or I went to Vegas for the weekend, I would just make an appointment with the local salon and they always had walk-in appointments available. Their facilities are also very well kept from state to state.

I don't want to be unfair because I get that companies have turn over and that it isn't their fault that hard wax isn't as good as soft wax (pain is beauty, right?), but I like to know that I can trust someone to give me the details needed to make an informed decision. I hope my review gives you the tools needed to make an informed decision of your own as I feel that the positives could definitely outweigh the negatives that I have mentioned for people who have different priorities than I do.",Beauty
oCEOqcFFpk9TZsSFSWhq9Q,ccVM2GDlHlWwoh-rxm7qYw,QmTb7f_oeM7o6DLIQ2I2Jg,2015-08-07,"The sad part is that I really want places like this to succeed, and I'm so glad to find one this large and with this much inventory, but I've never understood the terrible customer service that I experience in these places.
Can't they understand that they are quickly becoming extinct, and the policy of no eye contact and no interaction with anyone who doesn't work there isn't a sustainable business model?

You literally have to walk past a staff counter on each floor who will not acknowledge your existence, and it's completely understandable if they are busy, they weren't, and I have no interest with a new salesperson friend, but a ""hey, how's it goin'"" or ""can I help you"" would be greatly appreciated.

As a person on their initial visit, I would have loved to have a quick overview of the store itself because although there are signs posted as you walk in, I obviously ignored them.  I strolled onto the first floor and not being a comic book person, I didn't have an interest in their inventory.  It wasn't until I saw someone get off the elevator that I realized there were more floors to visit.  I spent way too much time on a floor where I had very little interest because I thought it was all they had to offer.  I would have much rather known initially and started my journey on a floor that catered more to my interests.

That being said, for as long as they have been there and as much inventory they had it wasn't what I would call exceptional.  Now I don't know a thing about comics, there are two floors dedicated to them and from what I could tell they had some really cool, really old items that I enjoyed looking at just because of their age and graphics, but I'll leave that review up to someone who knows more about them.

The DVD\/BR selection was better than average.  They have so much and yet it seemed lacking at the same time.  There wasn't anything terribly obscure, and there wasn't a lot of volume on the items I thought they would have acquired.  I'm usually on the look out for television series and wrestling and I wasn't impressed.  No Monk, Psych, not much Family Guy or the Simpsons and nothing really obscure.  I'm not saying those are good gauges of a quality store, I'm just saying they are the usual fodder I see stocked and they were markedly absent.  Also, there were a couple of items I had to put back because of the price, their prices are a little high for used inventory.  
I go into these places because I enjoy looking through these items but I'm savvy enough to know what internet prices are for them, I'm not an economist but if you just charged slightly less than the internet, I'm much more likely to purchase the item.
I also know when an item is obscure and hard to find, but it unnerves me to no end to have my excitement of finding them squelched by the ""more than a buy it now"" pricetag.  I understand supply and demand but I also understand competition and comparison and no matter how obscure an item is, and most of these were not what I would call ""holy grail"" items, I will always be able to find it online eventually if I really wanted it.  When I'm in this situation, I relate these purchases to impulse buys, it's there, it's in my hand and it would be cool to walk home with, but when you make the price equal or greater than what I can buy it for elsewhere, and you have made no effort to connect with me as a customer, you can bet I'm going to leave it on the shelf.
I apologize if this has turned into a diatribe against these types of stores in general, but I did have all of these thoughts while I was there.

The cd selection was good.  It is on the top floor and I almost walked out without realizing that it was an approachable floor.  Again, read the sign upon entering.  Although they had a lot, their downfall was two-fold, most of their inventory seems to gravitate towards the death and dark metal and most of it was new.  It's always as if the guy who purchases the cds for the store purchases them for his own interest.  Their used selection was small but it wasn't bad.  They also do in my opinion the mortal sin of used cd stores, they charge too much for their cds and they don't have a listening station.  I'm not throwing down $6 for a used cd for a band that might be good because I like their cover art.  My musical tastes are way too narrow for me to justify that expenditure.  Now you let me listen to them before I purchase them, I'll grab a handful and quickly listen through them and probably grab a couple, especially at that price.  Start at $2 and I'll take a chance unheard.  Again, no economist, but 1 purchase from me is more than the none that I made.

The ""leave your bag at the front"" is understandable, but if you make this policy, I would appreciate a little more attentiveness toward my other purchases.

They have a few toys in the basement, nothing special.

They seem to dabble in a lot and master nothing.  I could become a regular but it would only be if I happen to in the area.",Shopping
RXPV5XUIr9abacGCmqcNlQ,YA-caxALI4C-eCiSM97new,pJsJBzOeBIV9pOWMuq-vMw,2016-02-23,"I have to say that when venturing into the wasteland that is Homestead, one never really knows what one may find. It is great that someone is making an attempt to revive some of the multitude of vacant buildings which are rotting away two blocks from yet another mill-turned-mall. This neighborhood once had a short list of 'must visits'...and then came...the mall. And away went...the must visits. From my point of view, except for the usual strip mall shopping, there are only two 'draws' to the entire neighborhood. The movie theater, and the Carnegie Music Hall. And I really feel that Dorothy 6 will excel...when there's a show at the music hall. OR, in exceedingly rare cases, an intellectual winner at the megaplex movie theater that doesn't appeal to the mindless chain chow masses who only go to watch things blow up..

Dorothy 6 is a little architectural surprise in a mostly plywood-windowed run down area that USED to be a livable working class neighborhood. Exposed brick, chandeliers...a comfortable and only slightly pretentious bistroid setting. Definitely a bit out of place for the location, but a good start.

A friend and I were on a night-out reprieve from a snowed-in week, and decided to try something 'different' that had been raved about by Yelpers.

The food? We had a stuffed meatball appetizer, which were four little meatballs stuffed with cheese and served with a dipping sauce of some sort. The meatballs were very good, and the dipping sauce was not any kind of distraction from the flavor of the meat.

Earlier in the day, I'd had a late breakfast with another friend who took me to a place with a Reuben that was reported to be very good, but turned out to be just ok (as usual). And here at D6, there it was on the menu...a Reuben. Well, ok. Try TWO new ones in one day. So I ordered the Reuben with fries, and my friend ordered the Pierogi sampler.

The waiter was very pleasant and attentive in his hipster bearded and over-tatted way, and actually was very nice and efficient. He kept the Diet Coke flowing, which is an awesome thing.

So the food arrived, and the report is in. The pierogi were nicely and obviously home made, with quality ingredient stuffing. She had three flavors to sample. Cheese. beer and bacon, and Jalapeno. I tried a bit of one of the jalapeno, and it was very good. But I believe she had five pierogi for $13? We're not talking cover-the-plate pierogi. We're talking a little smaller than Mrs. T's, but made from scratch. Dough, potato, and just enough of the extra 'ingredient' (jalapeno, bacon, etc.) for a zing. $13 for five? A bit steep. They were very tasty. But not worth an hour of your average Pittsburgh working wage.

The Reuben was a little less in price, even with the fries, but again, failed the NY Reuben test. This and the lunch Reuben were very similar, except this one DID use dark rye, but very light on the meat, which is the reason for a Reuben. The fries were actually not very good at all, and really seemed like frozen pseudo steak fries from the Sysco truck. I didn't eat those.

The place has good service, and a comfortable atmosphere...but as I've said many times before, I go out to eat for...food. I don't eat atmosphere. And no matter how nice the server might be (even IF he slips me his phone number and says 'call me, daddy'), if the food isn't a huge wow, I probably won't be back to 'eat'. That being said, should the Carnegie Music Hall pull in another artist worth venturing into that neighborhood to see, Dorothy 6 certainly is one of the best choices outside of 'the mall', and a much better choice than anything chainey IN the mall.

It was a good place to hang out and talk. A better balance between food and price, and it would be a bigger winner.",Restaurant
uMvTrtrKBDk19rQwaiGMvQ,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,CYWRPE-1IHPBb-zfFO6KRg,2015-04-23,"From Tom Jetland, the man who brought you FEZ, Bliss ReBar, Switch, and Pizza People Pub comes a new restaurant that embraces the popular pass around concept.  While Corduroy isn't strictly speaking a tapas restaurant in the truest sense, it does offer dishes both large and small that can be shared amongst a couple of people or even large groups.  I've sampled the pass around concept before at places Tuck Shop and (the now defunct) Centurion with positive results.  Based on my first experience here it seems like Jetland's crew have hit on a winner with this concept.  Not everything was perfect during my first go around, but plenty of promise abounds.

My Mom actually wanted to grab dinner for the night at Switch next door.  After thinking about it for a second, I remembered reading some initial publications about Corduroy's opening just a few weeks prior.  Since its right next door, I figured I'd steer us here since we'd both already been to Switch.  The space occupies what was a long time Schlotzsky's Deli.  You won't find any traces of the old deli here as the space now includes a narrow bar area at the main entrance and a cozy dining area facing Central Avenue.  Additionally, there's a decent sized patio around the southeast corner of restaurant (though fair warning you'll probably get a steady whiff of the Burger King chimney across the street while you're out there).  On the whole the restaurant very much has the feel of a lounge, albeit a classy one.

We grabbed a table in the dining area since it wasn't crowded.  Much like Tom Jetland's other Downtown restaurants, the menu here is expansive with a wide variety of dishes that deliver their own take on otherwise familiar ingredients.  To start with my Mom and I decided to split a plate of their crab balls.  Basically 5 crab cakes in ball form served with arugula and a lemon aioli (which at first glance looks like yellow mustard).  I love crab cakes and this didn't disappoint and the lemon aioli was a subtle but delicious accompaniment.  I was ready to dive into one of the sandwiches on their regular menu, but my Mom was so excited after the crab balls she wanted to stick to the pass around menu....and then some.  Before I knew it, my Mom was ordering FIVE (!!!) more dishes to share just between the two of us.  Yikes.  

Apologies, as I didn't get photos of all the dishes, but here's the full rundown.  First an order of their empanadas with barbecue pork and cilantro inside.  It comes 5 to a plate.  Delicious pork filling, though the shell didn't quite have the thickness or the crunch that I like with empanadas (i.e. Fuego Bistro's version).  Next, a small order of their creamed cabbage with bacon and parmesan cheese.  Fantastic texture with nice cold crunchy cabbage and the cream sauce mellowed out the sharpness of the cheese and the brininess of the bacon.  Next, an order of their Chicken Piri Piri.  Chicken with tobasco, garlic, peppers, peanuts, and scallions over a fruit flavored rice.  This was probably the most disappointing of the dishes in my opinion as the chicken tasted pretty bland despite all the seasoning and didn't contain anywhere near the spicy punch I was expecting.  Next we got the Braised Red Curry Lamb over couscous and veggies.  This was probably my favorite of all as the curry sauce they used tasted wonderful on the lamb as well as the veggies.  The lamb was cooked just right and there was no shortage of meat.  Finally, we shared one of their desserts.  Their dessert menu changes daily so its never listed, but tonight we went with their chocolate cake with ice cream and caramel sauce.  The waitress told us the caramel sauce would be what we most remember about this dessert and she was right.  The caramel sauce was pretty unreal.  Not sure what they put in it, but it was heartier than most caramel sauces I've had.  Complimented the cake perfectly too.  

And no, we absolutely did not come anywhere close to finishing all that food ourselves.  Multiple take out boxes were used on this night.  Not that my Mom cared as she was basically in heaven.  Overall, a great opening impression from the food to the ambiance to the friendly staff.  Though the prices can be a little steep for some of the food (similar to FEZ and Switch), the quality and creativity is certainly good enough for me to recommend a try here.  The bar makes for a great happy hour spot and (also of great importance) there is ample parking in the lot east of the restaurant (which also serves as parking for Switch and Durant's).  If your Mom goes as nuts for this place as mine did, don't say I didn't warn you.",Restaurant
aKk10NDbQrbWmzUeLDOHRA,kc6HG348FeHekzBNEfW7eg,pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,2007-07-09,"I agree 100% with some of the reviewers who address the long wait time and the issue about what constitutes as some of the world's best pizza.  Our group of six were well-informed about what to expect were therefore comfortably prepared for an absolutely great experience.  We were told that there would be a two hour wait, so we arrived at Pizzeria Bianco's at 5:00 p.m., put our name down, and happily passed the time away with champagne, great beer, and a nice cheese and salami plate at Bar Bianco's.  It gave us a chance to relax, catch up with one another, and develop a great buzz (and appetite!) before we were seated.  

Sure enough, we were seated on-time and there was great energy in the restaurant.  The decor was quaint, simple and not pretentious.  Despite the huge pizza oven that became an interesting focal point in the restaurant and could be seen from any point in the dining room, it was comfortably cool for its patrons in the Phoenix heat!  The place is a bit small and I wouldn't recommend going with more than 6 people.  For those who complain about this factor, I've learned through my travels that some of the coolest locations in the world like the Devil's Throat which accommodates only one spelunker at a time in its cave passages, or the little booth in the Parisian cafe that accommodates a maximum of four people at a time  - not every place can always accommodate you - sometimes YOU have to accommodate the place and sometimes you have to sacrifice a little for the experience.  (Alrighty, I guess that's enough ranting about the Ugly American from me!).  The place has a casual vibe and there were plenty of patrons in t-shirts and shorts, but I would feel like I were disrespectful of the whole experience if my husband hadn't worn at least a collared shirt with his shorts.  We all had shorts on, but were dressed nicer than if we were just going to the local taco stand.  

We ordered 5 out of the 6 pies on the menu and we also ordered two salads (plenty of food for all of us just as the waiter had advised).  The caprese salad (tomatoes and mozzarella) had some of the tastiest mozzarella I've ever had!  All of the pies were great and I would not be the least bit hesitant to order any of them again, but my personal favorites were the Margherita and the Sonny Boy.  Not surprisingly,  everyone at our table had a different favorite because they were all great.  Overall, not only was the thin crust a perfect combination of chewy and crispy, but it was also tasty - I could eat the crust without any toppings (one prerequisite for me in a great pizza - like fresh home made pasta that doesn't need anything but a little olive oil and sea salt).  Each pie was a work of art - just beautifully rustic and easily identifiable since the toppings were certainly not hiding under a ton of cheese - they were lying on top in all their naked glory.  So people want to know - how does it compare to authentic Italian Pizza or New York Pizza?  I don't know.  It's Pizzeria Bianco's pizza!  

Now the all important final answer everyone wants to know - is Pizzeria Bianco's the best pizza in the world?  I can't say for sure - I haven't been to Italy or a bunch of other places in the world that has pizza, but with impeccably fresh ingredients, undoubtedly good food, a great atmosphere, and courteous service, it is up there with some of the greatest pizza and greatest and most memorable pizza experiences I've ever had.  That's good enough for me to give this place five stars.",Restaurant

Since I don't take the newspaper, don't have a convenient printer, and my husband recycles all circulars before they can enter the house and become part of the slush pile of mail that already teeters dangerously on its designated stool, I used to avoid Michaels unless something I specifically wanted was on sale that week. Otherwise it would be too depressing to buy anything, knowing that almost every week there's a 40%-off (almost everything) coupon, if only you have the patience to get it.

Now Michaels has a smartphone app for paper-haters like myself, and the employees at this store have no problem scanning it. (Take that, hordes of restaurant servers who have yet to master Groupon's app.) Furthermore, the app sometimes offers daily coupons that you won't get in the mail.

You probably already know that Michaels is a big-box national chain craft store. I've been shopping at Michaels since 1980s in Texas and at this location since they opened. So, knowing what Michaels is and should be, how does this particular store measure up?

Well, if you measure the length of the check-out lines, you can see one reason that I can't give this store more than two stars. I'd give the typical Michaels store 3.5 stars, with 4 stars for ones with great staff and organization. I don't like the coupon-driven business model or the sometimes limited range of options in the stock (tending toward the cheap), and the employees rarely seem to have any actual craft knowledge, but Michaels in general will get the job done if you know what you want.

The people working the checkout have always been friendly, but I can't count the number of times I've simply put down my shopping basket and walked out because, even if I'm ""only"" a half-dozen people away from the (usually lone) checker, the wait has already gone too far into double-digit minutes. (Note: I usually shop in the evening, but I don't think I've ever had a good queue experience.)

My husband would tell you that he doesn't like the weird smell in any Michaels, but this one's floral\/plastic\/whatever-it-is scent does seem more heady, perhaps because the store is smaller than some. I don't know the actual square footage, but everything feels very crowded and seems to always be in a state of stocking\/unboxing, like if you wander down certain aisles of a grocery store at 3 a.m. It doesn't make for pleasant browsing, just getting inspired like I can at other craft stores.

My final criticism is that the ongoing classes could be better advertised. The one-off make-and-takes and so forth get good coverage at the front of the store (kudos there), but every time I think I'm tempted to finally do a Wilton course, I can't seem to find a calendar or fee list. (The one time I asked an employee, she and the cashier on duty couldn't either, but that was over a year ago and hopefully is no longer the case.) Maybe if the store were less cluttered\/messy I wouldn't miss it.

I hear that Michaels charges much more for Wilton classes, but that they often have sales or a coupon to make the fees comparable to Jo-Ann's prices. Again, this constant shuffle of ""sale"" prices that match regular prices elsewhere bugs me, but that's a Michaels-thing and not particular to this store.

Overall, this is not a bad place to shop. I give it two stars (""Meh. I've experienced better."") because I feel it does have some compelling store-specific issues: the wait times, the nice-but-always-so-harried staff, and the messy look of the store with a few organization issues. (Products that are in the same category - like stamps or stickers - are sometimes aisles apart.) 

But, if you know you just want some champagne microbeads, AND you have your coupon (always bring a coupon!), this location will be perfectly serviceable. (And don't forget to check your receipt for another coupon.)",Shopping

I love the salon, and also enjoy that I can pick up my Urban Decay eye liner, stila lip stain, and some Burt's Bees lip balm for my sweetie all in one swoop. The customer service really can vary based on who you interact with, but in the past year, I feel like the customer service has gotten so much better and the majority of the time, I've had a terrific experience.

I had never tried using the salon, but in November I had a flyer that had a good deal on a cut and color. I figured why not. I didn't love my (then) current salon, and needed a cut pretty bad - I had a conference coming up and I couldn't remember the last time I had a trim (whoops). They were able to get me in that week, and were very friendly when making the appointment. I booked with the salon manager, who does cost a little bit more (I did appreciate that they told me that when I made my appointment, otherwise I would have been a little annoyed). I have to say, well worth the slightly more expensive cut and have one of my best hair cuts ever. Emily, the salon manager, is friendly and bubbly - without having that too syrup-y sweetness that gets on my nerves. She is fun, and the type of girl I can see myself bitching about work or relationship problems over some beers. I appreciate that Emily listened to my concerns, asked plenty of questions, and then offered suggestions. In the end, I tried something a bit different because she seemed to know what she is talking about (and hey, hair grows back).

One of the signs of an excellent hair cut in my book is a cut that looks good but also looks good while it grows out. This is probably what has impressed me the most about Emily's skills - when it gets closer to my next cut, I can tell I need a trim but it still looks pretty good! My mom (who is a wonderful lady, but rarely compliments my hair) even has gone on and on about how good my hair looks. Further, I never once felt like Emily was trying to up-sell me or add anything on. When I asked about manicure stuff, she answered my questions without being pushy at all (and I went for a gel or Shellac manicure - I can't tell the difference between them). 

Enough about how in love with my hair cut I am. I like Ulta because they have good sales. I'm not rich, so where I can save a few bucks, I'm all about it. Some of Ulta's sales are really fantastic, especially if you pair it with a coupon. that's when I stock up on stuff (they sell a body scrub that I absolutely adore). Now, you can't always use the coupons on all products (such as the higher end ""prestige"" brands), but I buy enough other stuff that it's not a big deal. Plus, it's not like Sephora mails out coupons any more frequently and offers $3.50 off at least once a month (sure, $3.50 off $10 isn't a lot, but it's worth it to me!), and I've never received a coupon for cosmetics at any department store. 

Sometimes certain brands (especially the drug store stuff) aren't very well stocked. I recently wanted to purchase some bath goodies and One (I think that's the brand) had three bath bombs total - I bought two. But really? THREE?? I would have happily bought nine of them. Also, I once purchased a lipstick that came packaged in a box, got home, and went to try it on only to find that it had already been sampled by someone else. YUCK. Luckily they were very nice about exchanging it. As I mentioned that the customer service has improved, so has the cleanliness of teh store. That said, some displays tend to just be cluttered no matter what and that can make it tricky to find what you want. If you like nail polish though, Ulta is one of the best stores to shop at, plus they tend to have a good selection of Zoya polish.",Beauty

Went in last weekend (10\/30) at 7:00 pm. Starving! There were a couple of people in line, a few people at the tables, and four people at the bar (4 bar stools total at the bar). We browsed the menu and decided to order take out and have a beer while we waited.  Two seats opened up at the bar, and we got our beer.  Tried to pay then, but the cashier said he would cash us out once our food was ready.

I had Kiltlifter, my boyfriend had Scottsdale Blonde.  Beer was nice and cold.  

From where I was sitting, I could see right into the kitchen, watching them hand toss the dough and make everything fresh.  Getting a bit more hungry now, after about 8-9 minutes I heard them call out our order in the kitchen ""take out - Italian (sandwich), baked ziti, garlic knots"". Yes! We were up next.  Then, that's when it all seemed to fall apart.  

After 20 minutes, our beers were finished, another couple had come in, ordered, sat down next to us. In the kitchen I kept hearing ""I need those garlic knots,"" about every 3 minutes. After another 15 minutes, the couple next to us got their wings.  The kitchen counter had a few pizza boxes lined up that the staff kept opening, peeking in, and leaving sitting there.  Seemed to be some chaos in the kitchen.  The delivery guy was wandering around between the kitchen and the bar.  ""I need those garlic knots,"" yelled again.  

By this time I'm starving and the man tossing the dough in the kitchen kept looking at me, pretty sure he could sense my frustration as I'd been sitting there watching them for nearly an hour.  And still had no food and no explanation.  The curly haired cashier didn't even check back to see if we wanted more drinks.  

At this time, my bf stepped outside for a smoke. I noticed the cashier grab the wings from the people next to me, take them to the kitchen and pour some kind of syrup all over them, bring them back out and plop them down.  The customers said, ""wow, he is angry"".  Meanwhile he is 4 feet away from them completely ignoring us.  They looked at me and asked if we were getting food.  I said, well, it's been an hour. An. Hour!!! And we had no food.  Still, the cashier ignored us. Even though he was standing right in front of us.  The other customers said they'd been there before and usually it was very good, but tonight was not.  

A man came in to pick up carry out, the cashier grabbed a to go bag from one of the warming bags on the counter, handed it to the guy. The guy told him he'd ordered three pizzas, not pasta.  The cashier went back to the kitchen, came out and told the guy that they had burned his pizzas and they were making new ones.  He then put the to go bag he tried to give that guy back into the warming bag.  

Then for some reason, the cashier grabbed the to go bag from the warming bag, the same one he tried to give to the other customer, and slid it in front of us, saying, your food is ready.  I sort of chuckled saying how he tried to give another customer my food, no reaction. Ummm....but where are the garlic knots?? He went to ask the kitchen, but by this time we peeked at our food.  The lettuce and tomato on the sandwich were all wilted and warm, the bread was soggy.  The garlic knots were nowhere in sight. 

Absolutely no apologies or sense of urgency or even acknowledgement from the staff.  We said, know what? We are out.  It's been an hour now.  My bf said let's pay for the beers and go.  The cashier offered nothing. No apologies, no beer is on the house, he did absolutely nothing to keep our business or smooth it over in any way.  In fact, he snatched my bf's debit card, swiped it, slammed the receipt and pen down for him to sign. Not a single word.  

And we walked out, starving.  

Like I said, the food that was coming out of the kitchen looked good.  I'd like to like this place as it is so close to my house, but the staff made absolutely no effort to let us know what was going on with our order. The cashier, the delivery driver who was hanging around, the guy in the kitchen tossing the dough, all of them clearly saw us sitting there empty handed for an hour and did nothing.  Very disappointing.",Restaurant
RzKh43hCb_4bSRbucHnaJw,DqSIy8QM7fnvVNAoKw0QoA,plD9cuwxJ5esXPT9rY3tmQ,2016-02-22,"I was recommended to Hair Attractions by a co-worker of mine (Erica) who found this location through Groupon. Constantly, Erica would rave about her technician from Hair Attractions, Reiko. Hair Attractions offered a lower price than my technician offered me. Regardless, I liked my higher-priced lash technician - she did some beautiful work on me and I had no intention of leaving. It was only when my technician had to cancel my refill appointment due to a serious family emergency that I sought out Reiko at Hair Attractions. I needed a refill so I booked at Hair Attractions. 

This is my first review on Yelp - even if I have an awful experience at an establishment I find via Yelp, I won't feel compelled to write a bad review. Conversely, if I have a good experience, I won't write a good review either. I figure that other people will do the job and do justice with the rating system. However, I've been meaning to write a review for Hair Attractions for a while. After having been there every 3 weeks (for my refill appt.) over the last couple months, I feel most prepared to substantiate a 5-star Yelp rating for my experiences being a patron here. 

I can only speak on my eyelash-extension experience with Reiko. Reiko has a tremendous work ethic and won't let you leave unless she and you are satisfied with her work. She asks you questions about what YOU want and then works to get you there:

For example, my co-worker Erica had very brittle lashes but wanted long extensions so Reiko worked from a smaller lash size to a longer in response to how her lashes were responding. After a few weeks, Erica's lashes were actually healthier then before (due to her not excessively bothering them with cosmetics\/eyelash curlers\/etc) and she now rocks the same length as I do. Erica expressed that she was dissatisfied with how weak her natural lashes were so that's why Reiko put in the extra work to do this. 

I showed Reiko a picture of lashes I wanted that were very up-curled to open up the eyes. Reiko asked me questions about it and I confirmed with her that the reason I wanted to have that strong curl was to give the appearance of length.  At this, she suggested that we instead increase the length on the outer parts of my eyes because, due to the almond shape of my eyes, my result would not have the exact same effect as the model in the picture I showed her (who had more rounded eyes). I'll attempt to attach a picture that shows the result. I'm really happy, she helped make my almond-shape more striking. 

Personality-wise, Reiko is up-beat and fun which makes any lengthy eyelash extension appointment so much more bearable. I also believe she has great integrity. I have asked about multiple services that Hair Attractions offers and Reiko is always the first one to tell me the pros\/cons and urge me to think about whether I truly want it:

Once after an eyelash appointment, I asked how much it would cost to remove tape-in extensions. Reiko gave me a quote and then asked why. I told her that I had tape-ins installed that I was tired of. Surprised she hadn't realized I had extensions in, she ends up staying later to help me remove them same-day. I asked her about the extensions\/color services her salon offered once my tape-ins were removed and Reiko replied by 1. answering my question and 2. telling me that my hair cut and natural ombre color were styles that her clients come into the salon to achieve (urging me to wait a little because with the current state of my hair, it would be where I told her I wanted it in a short amount of time and that I wouldn't feel like it was worth the cost of new extensions). Up-selling me and making a profit were obviously not Reiko's first priority. That same night, I even witnessed Reiko handle an angry customer who had a bad experience with a colorist at the salon earlier that day. Reiko remained calm, listened to the customer (who literally would not stop talking and not let Reiko interject at all), and offered her either a full refund or an opportunity to make it right by fitting her in for an appointment (which would have been the very next day). 

I can only speak on my experiences with Reiko, however Reiko also happens to be the salon-owner. I would trust myself to any other stylist and I would go there for any other service because I know that in my experience Hair Attractions has been reliable and the salon-owner has integrity.",Beauty

Written on the bubblegum pink paper bags beneath L'Amour's logo reads ""Japanese Beauty And Life"", signifying their specialty of imported Asian cosmetics and beauty goods.  No longer limited to just Japanese brands, as the K-pop trend continues and we look to the perfect-looking skin and doe eyes of those pop stars, Korean beauty products also fill the shelves.

Yes, there's a much larger, chain-owned multi-brand cosmetics store in the mall right across the street, but the innovation of those brands are super slow in comparison to the Asian market trends.  For $30, you can get a tube of cream from Korea that temporarily (lasts roughly 3 hours) turns your skin ~3 shades whiter, and for another $40-50 you can get one called Wedding Dress Cream that you apply on bare skin when wearing a dress at a fancy occasions that will match your body to your newly super-pale face for about 5 hours.

Pastel and French-pastry shop themed packaging adorn the shelves like a literal candy store.  Things you never knew you needed, like self-heating, disposable sleeping eye masks\/shades made of paper (scented like lavender, rose, chamomile, mint) suddenly become a must-have.  

Or maybe just want to pick up a pack of facial-blotting papers?  There's a charcoal-infused pack endorsed by Kumamon (the black bear mascot of Japan's Kumamoto prefecture), a strawberry-cream scented pack, a chocolate-scented pack, a rose-scented pack...amongst a couple others hanging towards the back wall.

Need some fake lashes?  There's an entire shelf dedicated to your needs, filled with the more expensive Dolly Wink (unique to this brand are the bottom lash strips, putting Sucker Punch's Baby Doll eyes to shame), D.U.P., Meijiao, and more.  Next to it are the wall pegs displaying various eyelid tapes, which gives you the coveted ""double lid"" look for any mono-lids.  There was also a ready-to-use eyeliner tape, which gives you a fool-proof, perfect cat's eye in different thickness levels.

More seemingly random beauty items are here too, like soft squares of cotton pads similar to Shiseido's but at a much lower price point, and boxes of tissue paper that would probably feel like gently weeping into the open arms of a downy-winged cherub.  Scented laundry beads, circular seat cushions optimized for comfort, gel beads for scented rooms, colourful bottles and single-pack foils of hair care products, many powders and beads for a soaking bath that will add additional heat, scent, bubble, detox, ease muscle pain, or even slim you down (so the package claims) can all be found.  Wackier random stuff you might not think to look at it: PiaFloss, a scented floss for your pierced ears to remove dead skin buildup.  Velcro squares to pull back your hair without ruining your 'do with telltale clip marks.  Eye drops with refresh-levels between 1-10 (""refresh"" really meaning ""minty"") by the circle-lenses which give you a wide-eyed, innocent look - they've been all the rage in Asia for many years.

Vitamins fill a ""health"" wall at the back, but I'm always wary of these as the FDA isn't as strict in Asia and may have negative interactions with prescription medications.  

Staff are typically Mandarin-speaking - if you're Asian but don't speak Mandarin, if you hear something that starts with ""Ni-hao ma..."" most likely they are essentially asking ""Hi, how are you - is there anything I can help you find today?"".  Answer in English and they'll switch over.  Despite the store's byline, answering in Japanese will still give you an English answer.  

Even if you're not Asian, it's still worth a peruse.  
You're bound to find something that makes you smile.
And if you don't, well, there's a full-face mask that can help you with that (it will exercise your face muscles: back left wall, made of cotton, ~$50).",Shopping
uKNzvxHJK1QxZdkLhjdRQA,qygModUyyK_Hi_b1uxSLFA,5qsjQ2FiMrtXGTmkhCWalw,2008-10-30,"I found myself in a bind (and not the kinky kind) last Friday when, after spending all my allotted ""costume shopping time"" dealing with car issues, I faced the threat of having to appear at a Halloween party sans costume. Quelle horreur! 

I had six hours to find a costume that would befit a woman of my fabulous reputation. Deciding that this was far more important than, you know, helping students scan documents or walking professors through checking their e-mail, I picked up the office phone and started making calls.

First I called Torrid. I wasn't thrilled at their selection, but I'm a fashion-minded plus-size girl, and they fit that niche. While I was tempted to get their flight attendant costume (I would've put on some corpse paint and gone as a ""Fright Attendant""...get it? Get it? Fuck you, tool, I know I'm funny), Misty S and I have a rule about dressing up as each other's parents. I don't dress up as a flight attendant, and she doesn't dress up in an air force uniform. It's helped save our relationship.

They had a Ms. Lovett costume (""The Barber's Mistress?"" Really?) but some hosebeast I work with and totally hate was going as that at another party, and she hand-made her costume and I could not possibly stand to have my costume compared to hers. So that went.

I got the idea to go as Little Red Riding Hood. Having exhausted my options at Torrid and not quite daring enough to risk the vomitorium that is Party City, I looked up Easley's. 

Back when I was a mere Theater major (you called it, huh?) Easley's was synonymous with ""knows their shit"". Everyone who took costuming\/cosplay\/halloween parties (too) seriously went there. It was a name I could trust. In fact, I still have all the makeup I've bought from them over the years tucked away in a First Aid box (one day someone will figure out it doesn't contain gauze...but until then I can't afford a new box). So I gave it a try.

""Easley's, how may I help you?""
""Yeah, I was looking on your site, do you have the Plus Size Miss Red Riding Hood costume in stock?""
*Sounds of checking inventory* ""No, we don't, but we do have the other one, with the long black skirt, and we found another one not on the site.""
""Describe it to me, please?""
""Corset with gold braiding, short black skirt, red hood.""
""Oh wow. That sounds perfect. Can I have you hold it for me so I can come by and see?""
""No. You have to pay for them online before we can hold them.""
""But you said it's not available online.""
""Oh, we're going to upload it to the site right now.""
""Oh, okay, I see it...but...there's no picture.""
""Yeah. We don't have a picture of it. It'll be $39.95.""
""Wait, I'm supposed to pay for this sight unseen? Can't you just set it aside? I'll be there in like an hour. I can't afford to pay for this, drive over there and find that it doesn't fit, I don't like it, etc.""
""Sorry, no, we can't.""
""Ugh, okay. Thank you.""

Desperate (and a little curious) I went to order the mystery costume, and what do you know, not only was it invisble, but shape-shifting. Once in my checkout cart the price had changed (WITH MAGIC!) to 53.95. 

I called back. And was put on hold.  

Yeah, that's great, Endlessly Looping Sound Clip, but I really don't give a shit about the rental policy. I just want my costume.

I ended up hanging up. I wasn't even sure I could afford the costume even if it was only 39.95.

So I went home, threw on the pink tafetta nightmare I wore at Fetish Prom, slipped on a domino mask and some high heeled boots and went as a prom queen dominatrix. I was the life of the party

I know it sounds a little harsh of me to give them a 3 star for this one mixup, but seriously, I've never needed to get plastic involved to get anyone to hold something for me. I don't see what makes Easley's so special. What are the odds of another full-figured girl walking in within that hour time frame screaming ""QUICK! I NEED A SEXY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD STAT!"" 

I say relatively low, but that's only because I don't want to imagine that there's another me out there in the world. I'm enough.

After the Halloween fervor I fully intend to stop by and see if they have that costume available still. Because it sounds fabulous. But I think it's important to know whether or not it'll make my ass look fat before I make the commitment.",Shopping
vP22d_IFUkpJsCnHhpsJDQ,XceMlSn_puKELMpWnyeNkQ,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2014-01-04,"After a long hard year of work and grind I decided a few weeks before Thanksgiving we EARNED a great vacation somewhere.  After discussing it we settled on Las Vegas because neither of us had ever been.  We were VEGAS NEWBIES who heard tons of great tales of fab vacations, ritzy shows, fine dining & glorious shopping expeditions.  Within 1 week we booked 5 days\/ 4 nights package at the VDARA HOTEL & SPA.  The pkg was quite reasonably priced for air\/limo\/hotel\/showtickets.  The one negative with the package was with the airline tickets ... our round trip seats were not together: 2 COACH tickets & 2 BUSINESS CLASS tickets.  Biz class has a lot more leg room & larger seat but alas they made for QUICK TRADES for the 2 lucky fliers seated next to our coach seats. 

The VDARA is a beautiful boutique hotel.  We booked a Panoramic suite and the landscape view of the strip and mountains, room & amenities were fantastic!  Its a short trot to connecting hotels: THE COSMPOLITAN & ARIA.  True ... rooms are not assigned pre-stocked w\/ the essentials ( kitchen supplies, laundry detergent, etc) but everything was furnished upon request.  TIP: Take stock of what's missing upon check-in, jot down the list & turn it in to concierge.  It will be managed nicely.  Concierge also assisted us w\/ a dinner reservation & 1 day car rental too!  Must also mention how striking the arrangements of fresh flowers, potted plants & live trees were at the ARIA ... mountains & yards of complex colorful arrangements as far as the eye can see.

The MICHAEL JACKSON ONE show at Mandalay Bay was good but not great.  The high majority of the ticket buying audience is ADULT: I'd more appreciate the show's central theme to be a bit more mature Vs. LOST KIDS. I particularly liked how pics of the audience were captured & combined w\/ newspaper headlines projected on overhead ceilings!  I saw my face there several times!!!  Michael Jackson 's hologram performs at show end; its a tad smaller size than expected but a very good reproduction. Very life like & smooth motions.  Thankfully I was seated in row 3!  A keepsake picture is a must!

Half of the trip we ate breakfast\/lunch\/dinners at the ARIA.  The last half we dined b\/l\/d at THE WICKED SPOON inside THE COSMOPOLITAN.  WS WINS HANDS DOWN!!!  Very comfortable dining experience.  We absolutely delighted in the opulent choices of every food\/beverage you can possibly imagine.  Masterfully prepared, showcased and served.  $50 each for breakfast $100 each for dinner.   Trust me you can and will try every food station!  Blew my mind to see diners returning from the seafood station 2 and 3 times w\/ shrimp & king crab legs piled high on plates!

The shopping was divine . . .  we dropped a nice bundle NOT ON THE TABLES but with retailers we frequent COACH, FENDI, LUCKY BRAND, MARC ECKO, etc.  All located within a short 15 min drive from Vdara.  The deals were UNBELIEVABLE - - - a mere 30-40% of retail.

We can't wait to return to Las Vegas . . . the surface was barely scratched!!!  The sooner the better.  I'll add my pics ASAP.",Beauty
3Zz1V2xxS5S_fNRXpuAB3w,N1SRDhbaevbQZc0NleHUCA,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,2012-08-20,"Worst experience ever! Will not ever go back, will not ever reccommend anyone I care about to go.  Here's what happened:

My friend's Girlfriend was having a bday party there. They hada reservation 2 weeks prior, but when we got there they had ""lost"" the reservation.  Anyways, we get seated... all 11 or 12 of us.  Our waiter was horrible, and had no personality.  Not once did he smile, or make any one of us feel welcome.  I want to let you all know, the majority of the people in our party are in the restuarant business.  We all figured it was going to be great service because the prices were so high and because they were busy.  That was deff. not the case. 

One of the people in our party ordered the Shrip cocktail... it was like 15 - 20 bucks, and only had 4 pieces of shrip in a large cocktail glass. Very lame.  My gf ate half of her food (Club Sandwhich) and got food poisening. I ordered the turkey burger and the middle of it was not cooked all the way.  I waited for about 20 minutes to see our server again to let him know. some of the people ordered a bottle of wine, that did not show up on the tab, but the server (his name is Alan) told them ""if your paying cash just add the $32.00 dont worry about the tax."" Did this guy just try to get a much larger tip then deserved?! Did this guy also just steal money from the company?! WTF.  Who does that?!  Obviously Alan did, and he seemed pretty new to the company, so apparently he learned that trick from possibly someone else who works there.  

The next day I call, speak with a ""manager"" I believe his name was Greg Waters or something like that, he didnt make his name very clear to me over the phone.  So I explain to Greg my gf has food poisening.  He didn't seem to care at all.  Matter of fact, his first few words were, ""Sir, we are very busy right now, can I take down your name and number and call you back."" That upset me.  Here I am, trying to let him know that his server\/servers are stealing money from the company and my girlfriend is sick because of your food.  So what am I supposed to do?  So I left him my info, and waited for a phone call back.  Never got one.  The next day I called and asked to speak with him again.  He gets on the phone, and I was again told he was the only manager on at the moment, and he would have to call me back.  I told him something like, ""you said that last time, can you make a couple minutes of your busy day today and call me back."" So he finally did.  He called me back, I explained everything to him again. 

He said he needed some kind of doctors note, I laughed, found it to be very funny, because my gf was in fact at a doctors office earlier the day and told him it would be no problem at all to get a note.  My girlfriend was in the office, many people around, and got the feeling she was going to throw up again, ran to the bathroom, and barely made it in time.  Luckily for the other people there.  So I told Mr. Greg Waters or whatever his name is, and he figured out a way to weasel out of ""needed"" the doctors note to refund us our money.  I guess he thought I was lieing about all this, and just assumed we wanted to get a free meal.  I told him it was only 39.09 and it's not like I wanted to get the whole group refunded, I only pay for my gf and myself, so we should only get our food comped... (other people will be writing their side of the story too, so you will see that everyone should have gotten their food comped as well.)  No biggie right?! You have a horrible server\/food\/experience you expect to get your food comped in order to hopefully keep you coming back.  Well not this guy.  I was wrong, appently this guy is such a tool that his manager has him on such a short leash he doesn't have the authority to comp 39.09.  I told him all I wanted was my money back, he said the only thing he could do was ""invite us to come back and the meal would be on him"".  What a total retard. Who is going to come back after that?!

I can not believe my turkey burger was 16.00.  I ate 2 bites of it, sent it back for being way undercooked, then about 45 minutes later ( 20 minutes of waiting to notify my M.I.A. server Alan, and about 25 minutes for the P.O.S. cooks to make another.)  When it comes back to me, the fries were the same fries that were on the fucked up plate.  A couple of them half eaten, cold, and soggy... REALLY?!

So my food right then would have been comped at probably 80% of any restuarant.  But not this place.  They are so strung out on the MILLIONS of tourists that will most likely only go to this place because they walked by, got the ""GREAT IDEA"" to ""CHECK IT OUT"" and unfortunetly being sadly mistaken that anywhere more than likely would have been a better idea.  

Luckily Capital One dispute department knows how to keep UNHAPPY customers. they refunded us the money.  Took a little bit, but im sure glad I saved my credit card reciept. Mailed it in, with their dispute form, and poof. Got my money back!",Restaurant

Still wanting to stick to Latin food, and this was nearby, and that we had a coupon from the Entertainment Book for buy one entree get one free, we tried this.

The food was really good for our party of 5.  The restaurant is pretty small with just a few tables, which anything over 20 people would be too much for that restaurant, so that is a negative thing.

The cost of the dishes were a bit more than what I expected, but since there are a lot of seafood dishes, perhaps expected.  We did not go online to look at their menu or prices.  So, per person, expect to pay over $10 plus tax and tip.

The dishes are elegant and there is a lot of veggies with the meats.  My husband and I are not big into the American Mexican taste of food, so it was nice to have something Latin without the typical beans, rice thing that is prevalent in many Mexican restaurants that are more Americanized.

We called before going and the woman that answered the phone did not speak much English and answered in Spanish, so if you don't have an inkling of Spanish, communication could be an issue.  

This place is not right at the NW corner of Alma School & Warner, but just north of the intersection on Alma School near where the Gun shop is.

With that out of the way, we ordered 4 dishes - Lomo Saltado, which is beef strips with onions, tomatoes, cilantro served over French Fries and a large scoop of rice.  This was tasty and my Colombian husband said it's similar to the Bistec we make at home (although, I think what we make at home is even better).  This had good flavor and is $12.

The 2nd dish was Aji de Gallina, which is a chicken stew with potatoes in a creamy sauce, also with a scoop of rice.  I liked it, but my husband and kids didn't seem to, so basically I ate a lot of the dish with a friend of ours (who very generously treated us to lunch - THANK YOU).  This dish is $11.

Since my husband is allergic to shellfish, we had to avoid all the seafood dishes with shrimp.  We did order a deep fried fish dish called Pescado a la Chorrillana, which this is covered with the similar red onions, tomatoes, and cilantro triage that the beef dish had.  This was also served with a large scoop of rice.  This dish is $15.

Lastly, we ordered a Fried Rice dish that had both chicken and beef in it.  It's a Peruvian style fried rice.  Being that I'm Chinese, it tasted similar to Chinese fried rice without the soy sauce.  Tasty and the kids really loved this dish.  I don't know how much this dish was, but in the $11-12 range.

The kids got different drinks.  Our son got a Peruvian Soda called Inca Kola, which I'm guessing is like a Coke drink.  Our daughter got Maracuya, which is a Passion fruit drink.  The latter was good, but I really just like drinking water with my food.  Didn't try the Coke.

This was an expensive lunch for my friend, and we are very grateful for his generosity.  Definitely not inexpensive, so if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the place.  The appetizer prices were what we expected to pay for lunch.  

So, the negative things are that the place is really small and it's a bit pricey.  However, if those things don't bother you and you love foods like this, this is a great place to come.  Service was friendly and fine.  And it's certainly not foods you get at any of the normal places to eat around here.

If you have a party that is bigger than 4 people, you definitely should call ahead to see if they can accommodate you.

The only other place that I can compare Peruvian food to is a place that was by C-Fu many years ago that burned down.  They had wonderful food and the food we ate today was a bit different.  

We'll have to save up some to come eat again, but we can put it on the places we'd like to come to again.",Restaurant

Now on to my review .So I totally don't look like I know a thing about Tattoo's because I don't have many but let me tell you I have looked LONG and hard at various shops and artists via social media plus going a long with friends\/family getting them done and this shop is HANDS down the best I have been to..  Not only is the décor\/location super fun! but the staff and artists I encountered are all super duper FRIENDLY!     I was BLESSED! to discover them via a Instagram post about their Friday the 13th Tattoos. I know I am somewhat hard to handle because I am a mixture of ADHD\/DITZY\/Demanding all in one so I am scared to throw done tons of cash and be stuck somewhere for HOURS without knowing they speak my language and I enjoy their vibe and frankly doing a consultation solves that problem but if I can get a FRIDAY THE 13th tattoo for $20 not only do I get a idea of how a shop is run but I am also able to walk away with some cute little INK. Anyhow I saw a  ad about Friday the 13th tattoos on Instagram  for Black Spade tattoo and I am so happy I did. I got the chance to see the work done by Ruck and fell in LOVE. I honestly didn't even need to really research much else after I saw a post requesting stickers for their bathroom but I did browse images of the tattoos and was impressed. They opened at 12pm , I arrived around 11:45am to a line outside the door formed about  8\/10 people deep so I hopped out of the car and got my spot. Parking can be tricky so prepare for that but its WORTH it because this shop is top notch. At 12pm Jesse and the shop manager who I should of noted her name but of course I didn't even after making a point to ask for it  came out with information about how the process would work and the rules.. As you can imagine on days with killer deals they are going to be busy and frankly it had potential to go very wrong but honestly it was smooth sailing and everyone knew their order . The shop has posted rules and awesome quick tips about tattoo myths that are awesome. They have a TV showing Netflix movies and water\/lollipops and awesome seating. It is small and NOT KID friendly but definitely welcoming. Two artists were doing tattoo's today Ruck and another gentlemen that has a name beginning with J but of course I forgot that too (if I can locate names I will update) anyhow both of them are super duper nice . I had the pleasure of talking to the artist that I can't remember his name while I was picking out my tattoo on this day they just do their flash in the binder but let me tell you the selection is ENDLESS and the quality of work is really good. I had quite a few people ahead of me and I was in there for about two hours which shows A- they don't RUSH you on the darn door , they still give quality work and B - I had tons of time to chat everyone up and the whole staff was not only friendly and knowledgeable but they were HAPPY to be at work and that to me says a lot about the culture of a place. I was blessed to get the chance to have Ruck to my tattoo and let me just say he's got a killer smile and a HELL of a lot of TALENT , my favorite take away is that he is HUMBLE and GENUINE and definitely someone I want to scream ""TAKE MY MONEY"" because I plan to figure out what I want and come back and have him do more work because he did the most ADORABLE little voodoo doll for me while being engaging and friendly.

thzWIjmfnrzikQ0-fcXvuQ,Jt1zgNmwz_jheOSmEsljPQ,uxPTFOMq9srmo54phvy6Xw,2011-10-07,"Came here this year for my birthday with a group of friends. The space was elegant and lovely. We were seated in a comfortable, cozy booth. 

We started off with some bread, served with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread was pretty ordinary, but I loved the balsamic vinegar, which was very thick and sweet. My major problem was that they didn't serve enough bread for the 6 of us (the basket only had 4 pieces) so I had to ask for more. For a restaurant of this class, this oversight was pretty shocking to me.

Now onto the food:

The bruschetta of the day topped with mushrooms and some kind of cheese that I cannot recall. We got two orders of it to share between the 6 of us. This was decent, but nothing extraordinary. The crostini was a little over-toasted and too crunchy for my liking. 

Eggplant parmigiana with tomato sauce and buffalo mozzarella: gorgeous presentation with layers of eggplant unfolding like a flower. From the bite that I tried, it tasted pretty good too. My friend really enjoyed her entrée, until she saw the bill later. 

Lombardia pizza with spicy Italian sausage, caramelized onions, basil and mozzarella: I liked the thin, crispy crust, but that's basically the only positive thing I have to say about this pizza. Everything else was utterly unimpressive. The pizza was dry, as was the sausage, and the herb overpowered all the other toppings. My boyfriend kept commenting about this ""nasty cheese taste"", which I couldn't detect. Regardless, the pizza was definitely a major disappointment for us, which is a shame because I love thin-crust gourmet pizza.  

Orrecchetti with hot sausage, rapini and Pecorino: I don't think anyone at the table enjoyed it too much. We all thought it was dry and bland. I guess my friends prefer saucy pasta, but I've actually had non-saucy pasta that I really enjoyed, so that wasn't the issue for me. 

Pappardelle with bison bolognese and ricotta: I actually enjoyed this a lot. The bison bolognese was thick, rich, and coated the pasta well. There was an abundance of bison meat (although it tasted like beef to me). The bolognese was very delicious.

Substituting for my birthday cake was Briscola's signature panettone bread pudding with dates, pistachio and vanilla gelato. I have to say that I absolutely loved it. I have a soft spot for anything warm and gooey with caramel, and this fit right into that description. The bread pudding was delectable, and I loved the addition of dates and nuts. 

And then the bill came and we all cringed. On Briscola's website, it clearly indicated that ""an automatic 18% gratuity is added to groups of 7 of more"". Apparently, they slapped on that 18% even though we were a group of 6. We weren't pleased about this at all. I normally don't have a problem paying a higher gratuity if the service was good, but I thought that the service was not remarkable at all. The bread issue aside, our server wasn't particularly attentive, and it was hard to flag her down. However, since it was a special occasion, we didn't want to make a big fuss over the bill. Though in hindsight, I wish we had said something at the time. Too late now!",Restaurant

If I could give zero stars, I would!! I have been here previously and not been impressed, and unfortunately I received a $300 gift card  for the ""Spa Soother"" package to this place for my birthday. In hindsight, I should have tried everything to get a reimbursement for my husband, but I figured, begrudgingly, I would give this place ONE MORE TRY. What a MISTAKE!!
First, let's start with booking the appointment. I had to call almost a dozen times just to book a spa day. I was placed on hold each time I called, anywhere from 15 minutes to a half an hour, and when I FINALLY got through to someone, the woman was rude and was irritated with my questions. I just wanted to know my options for the package! I booked my appointment and thought that this is the last time I ever return to this place. But wait...it gets better....
A few months later, the day of my appointment, there was an emergency in my family and I had to rush out of town. I called Mario's to reschedule, again, it took calling almost 15 times to get through to someone (just what you want to be doing when a loved one is rushed to the hospital) and the unpleasant woman I had spoken to previously, ripped me apart for having to cancel. She also told me I was ""lucky"" it was a family emergency, otherwise, they would have to charge me for the cancellation. 
I rescheduled the appointment for my spa day, and oh, what a disappointment it was!!!
First of all, I arrived on time, and no one was at the front desk. I wait. I look around and finally find someone to help me. She tells me to have a seat in the waiting area and asks if I would like a coffee or tea. I ask for a coffee. I sit down and the couches are dirty and there are several dirty glasses all over the tables. It seems odd since they just opened for the day; I could only assume they had not cleaned up from the previous day. As soon as my coffee arrives, before I could even put my cream in, another woman comes up to me and very sternly says, ""READY?"" I could not even keep up with her, down the hall, up the stairs, around the bend. She is speed walking, as I am trying to carry a cup and saucer full of hot coffee up three flights of stairs. So much for relaxing! She shows me to the locker room and says nothing about when she will be back, how to use the combination locks, and was just very rude. Luckily I had been there before, so I knew what to do. The first part of the day involved your choice of a steam, sauna or whirlpool. I chose the steam. They brought me to this little room and right outside where you change into the towel, there is a huge vent in the ceiling. This thing looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the Great Depression. There was so much dust, mold, and filth hanging down right above my head, I gagged. I almost took a picture. I wish I had. The second part involved a full body massage. This was the only good part of the day. The massage was absolutely wonderful, but I did not make a point of remembering the man's name who gave the message because I will not be returning. The third part of the day was for a facial. The woman who provided it did an okay job, but was not very pleasant. The fourth part was the manicure. I got to the station and picked out a polish. She told me it would be an extra charge to remove my gel polish. I asked how much. She said she would be right back. She comes back and tells me that she does not have time to give me a manicure, and that she would put my hands in paraffin wax. ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? After the paraffin wax was lunch in the restaurant. The woman waiting on me seemed very unhappy (so much for a pleasant day at the spa! Most of these people look like they just got in from a funeral!), and barely returned to refill my drinks. I had to ask another waitress for more water.
The final piece of this day was the most horrific. The fifth session was at the hair salon and includes a wash and style. The woman who told me she could not do a manicure due to time constraints gave me the hair wash. It lasted all of thirty seconds. No time to lay back and enjoy a relaxing scalp massage. I get to her chair and she rips the brush so hard through my scalp that I jumped! She ripped a bunch of my hair out of my head, and then told me she had to put me under the dryer in order to brush it (what??). Every dryer she took me did not work. After six tries, the last one worked. Then she took me back to another station, and proceeded to rip out my hair and really hurt my scalp. She told me she would not be able to style my hair due to all the bleach I have used, it was too damaged to straighten. I told her I did not use bleach (nice assumption!) and to go ahead and style. I was so relieved to get out of this place and drive home. I will never ever go back. This place should not even be operating as a spa. Do not waste your money or time. You can get much better for much cheaper elsewhere.",Beauty
PFGGRKDIiXlZre1rgN1XGQ,0-hb63A9uWjR1YIyVMu6rg,El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,2013-05-04,"I really want to give MGM 3.5 stars, but my issues were mostly due to bad timing and they deserve better than a 3.

My girlfriend and I stayed at the MGM from a Friday to a Tuesday.  I had stayed at the MGM once or twice before, and been to Vegas many times, but this was her first trip and her birthday weekend.

We had read in reviews that if you ask for upgrades, you can usually get them.  And seeing as how this was my girlfriend's first trip and her birthday, we thought we'd have no issues.  However, to play it safe, I attempted to use myvegas credits from Facebook on a room upgrade, only to discover they had none available (so much for 6 weeks of constantly playing fake video slots).  Nevertheless, I figured we'd be able to get something. 

Unfortunately, upon arrival, we were told they had no upgrades available.  The best they could do was a strip view and a $30 beverage credit.  Firstly, our strip view room was right at the elevator, which was nice because it saved us long walks to our room, but if you know the MGM Grand Tower, that also meant that our strip view was partially obstructed by a giant green wall.  As for the $30 beverage credit - outside of beer, you can't get a drink at the MGM for less than $15.  If you want one of those large frozen drinks or the yards, which is what we got, it was more like 1.5 drinks.  So MGM did a pretty poor job of making us feel pampered or making my girlfriend's first trip and birthday something special.

That said, the reason why this was somewhat our fault was because we chose a weekend that was the grand opening of the West Republic season (their Ultra Pool party) and the grand opening of their new nightclub\/lounge\/restaurant, Hakassan.  So, they were booked, and the lack of upgrades was mostly due to that.  That said, I think they could have come up with something besides 1.5 drinks.  Maybe passes to wet republic so we wouldn't have to spend $50 to get in, or passes to Hakassan so we wouldn't have to spend $75 - and Vegas, when you're starting to charge $75 just to get into your nightclubs, you've officially stopped caring about everyone but the wealthy.

Okay, complaints aside, the MGM itself is a great place to stay.  Rooms were moderately priced and very comfortable.  The walls are paper thin, so that is a drawback.  But they are spacious and well kept.  The casino floor is huge, with plenty of games.  I was a bit surprised that on a Monday night, with lots of open tables, we couldn't find a $5 min craps table, but that wasn't the end of the world.  The pool (the main pool, not wet republic) is spacious, relaxing, and a good time.  We had problems with service at the pool - the server seemed to only come around every 15 minutes, which doesn't sound like a lot, but we asked for a drink menu and didn't get it for 15 minutes, and then when we ordered, it was another 15.  Its one thing to only circle your station every 15 minutes, but you should really bring your customers what they asked for a bit faster.

We didn't eat inside the MGM except for one morning at the breakfast buffet, which is mediocre and actually made my girlfriend sick.  There are better buffets.  That said, we didn't eat at the MGM only because we did a lot of research and found other restaurants we wanted to check out, so that isn't a knock on the MGM restaurants.  They could be awesome, we just wanted to check some of the best ones reviewed here and on tripadvisor.

So all of this said, why am I giving it 4 stars?  It looks like I have a lot of complaints.  The thing is though, when I think about my stay, we had a fantastic time.  We liked the room, we liked the casino, we liked the resort, and I would repeat the trip in a second.  So while I want to give a complete picture, in the end, the things that went wrong were really minor in the gran scheme of things.  The staff at the MGM is really friendly.  Checking in and out was easy.  It was just a tremendous amount of fun, and the issues at MGM didn't detract all that much from the experience.  Like I said above, I would like to give it 3.5, but I can't, and my experience was better than a 3.  Without these issues, it would have gotten a 5.",Restaurant
tWANPwxA23IeY5JgwUi5qA,EmRwJ3IiIX5IfN59WWJYPQ,EjgPwxGTEM4H06cqOTuphw,2014-08-25,"On 8\/23, I went to the Aveda store in PV Mall to pick out my Pure Privilege birthday gift.  Since the store was busy, I went to the makeup to see if anything interested me.  After a few minutes, an associate asked if I needed any help picking out colors.  I smiled and waved the certificate in my hand and said, ""nope - I'm here to pick out my birthday gift today!""  I was excited to pick out a new fragrance since the patchouli blend I've always worn was discontinued.   I've gone through the experience at least five or six times, so I was looking forward to sitting down and going through the options.  

The associate said, ""Oh, well, you also have your double points certificate"" and proceeded to their back room to put her drink cup away.  I continued looking at makeup.  She came back, walked to the registers and says to the customer being rung up, ""I haven't seen you in so long!"" and then chats for a moment before walking over to the table where she started pulling out the oil blends.  She didn't say a word to me.  I looked over after a minute and she had a few of the bottles uncapped and lined up.  I put down the makeup and started to walk towards the table.  She still hadn't said anything to me about how we were going to walk through the experience, if she was ready for me, what I should be doing...nothing.  So I stood about four feet away from the table waiting for her to acknowledge me.  At this point she gestured at the stool and said, ""You can sit down.""  So I did, and then I waited because she was still uncapping bottles and setting them in a row.  When I didn't reach for any of the bottles, she looked at me and said in a snide tone, ""You can start anytime.""  I was floored.  First, that she spoke to me in that tone and second because I know this isn't how Aveda does things.  Going into an Aveda store is always a treat.  You're greeted.  You're offered tea.  The associates talk to you and suggestively sell and offer you a moment of wellness.  You almost forget how much money you're spending on product because they make it an experience.

In that moment, I was so shocked that I actually just did what she told me and started sniffing the bottles.  I eliminated a few, but I still had four in front of me, and I said, ""Hmm, I can't choose between these four,"" thinking that she would ask questions to help me narrow down a choice.  I got silence.  By this point, I am not only disappointed because I'm not being ""pampered"" (which to me is more fun than the actual free product), but I'm being given the silent treatment.  There is no conversation, no ""so what are you doing for your birthday,"" no acknowledgement that I'm in there for a special treat, no acknowledgement that I'm a Pure Privilege member, nothing.  Just an associate standing next to me, alternately watching me smelling bottles and staring into space.  I assume she had better things to do than to take care of me.  

I went on to ask about the notes in the other bottles, and then because I was so awkwardly uncomfortable with the whole situation between the silence and the staring, I just picked one and said, ""This is the one I'd like.""

She flipped the bottle onto the base and let it drain.  In complete silence.  When it was done, she hurriedly stuffed it into the envelope, handed me the envelope, and chirped, ""There you go!""  She hadn't even bothered to mark the envelope with my choice.  So as she turns away from me and starts putting the bottles back, I walk over to the counter to ask to borrow a pen.  She finally gestures at me so that I cannot pretend not to see her and says to me with an exaggerated fake smile on her face (she didn't smile at me the entire time she was ""helping"" me), ""Can I help you with something?""  I said, ""I would like to borrow a pen, please, because you didn't mark down which blend I chose.""  She replies in a syrupy, cheerfully fake voice, ""Oh here, let me do that for you"" and takes the envelope from me.  She hands it back and says, ""Can I offer you a moment of wellness?""  I lost it.  I said, ""No, you can't.  You should have done that from the beginning.  You have completely ruined my birthday treat AND my afternoon.""  And I proceeded to be something I have never been in a retail store before - an incredibly angry customer.

I have gotten bad and nonexistent service in lots of places, but none that ever made me feel this way or provoked this kind of reaction from me.  I did not get the woman's name, but she had dark brown, wavy, shoulder-length hair and glasses. The team at the Fashion Sq. store have always been fabulous.  I will never go to PV again.",Beauty
l17Vyt0uvJ6iWTxlNR8eiA,oqX8cA3ZeI_lEKTRiwBcPg,KSg6lpATxH5-4X3JvQbXyg,2016-05-02,"I recently moved to Toronto and was looking for a great facial. I get facials about every 6 weeks because I believe it counts as maintenance as I age. Leila did my facial and was excellent. She examined my skin and then customized my facial. My skin looked refreshed afterwards. I knew I had found my new skin guru! Before leaving I asked her to recommend an eye cream and a toner as I was getting low on my products. She explained to only spritz a toner and not to run a cotton ball on my face as its better for Ph etc. I appreciated her tip and said that I was glad because I don't like to rub toners on my face anyway and always use spritzers. When I came to the lobby Leila had put aside recommendations. As for the toner she said that it doesn't come with a spray but that I could buy a pump from the dollar store and just switch out the top and insert the pump spray. No problem. Leila gets 5 stars. Love her.
My bill was $388. I enjoyed the spa so much that I booked a facial for my husband the next day (Sunday). He gets facials quarterly and has been asking me to find a good place because his skin was looking tired. We are in our late 40's. Like I said, it's maintenance. 
The next morning I opened my toner and realized there was no way you could take the top off and replace it with a spray pump. It's a plastic squeeze bottle with a tiny hole in the top so the only way you could spray it is if you squeezed the entire contents of the bottle into another bottle. For $43 there are spray toners out there instead of doing this. I want something I'm going to buy and use consistently. I'm not going to squeeze the contents out of one bottle to put into a spray bottle every single time I run out and have to buy a new one. That's just silly. I wrote the reason on the back of the receipt and asked my husband to return it when he went for his facial. It was less than 24 hours that I had the product, it was never used, I had the receipt and even put it back in the original packaging. No rips or dents, it looked exactly as it had when I bought it 18 hours earlier. 
After my husband's facial he asked to return the toner explaining that I had written the reason for the return on the back of the receipt. The snotty blonde receptionist refused to take it back. My husband told her that it was poor customer service. He runs a company and understands the importance of taking care of the people that support you. My husband explained this to me via text. I decided to go inside when I picked him up because surely he got it wrong. He just spent around $100 and I spent almost $400 the day before. $500 in two days and they won't return $43? I went around and around with this gal explaining the situation. I explained I would not have bought it had I known I couldn't just change out the top. This is what I was told by a member of your staff.  I was infuriated that this was the customer service I was experiencing. The receipt did not say no refunds on it and nobody said anything about not being able to return it when I purchased it. I said to the girl, ""I get a facial almost every single month, my husband gets one every 3 months, we just spent $500 in here in the last two days and you are going to refuse to take back $43?!"" She held to her guns. I couldn't believe it. I was dumbfounded that someone could have such little business sense working in an industry that has so much competition. I told her, ""that's just stupid business. Do you realize how much money you are turning away?"" I loved my facial, my husband enjoyed his but yet, we will never step foot in here again because the employees who handle customer service are not trained to make informed decisions to provide good customer service. At this point an intelligent staff member came around the corner who had been listening. She quickly made an executive decision to refund my money. The blonde girl was annoyed but did as she was told. She never once apologized. She did say, ""Well I said you could have a credit on your account"". I looked at her and said, ""You never ONCE said that to me! Not one time did you offer anything at all. I would have taken a store credit because I would have come back for another facial but you did not offer it."" All she said was ""I'm just doing what I've been instructed to do."" Well honey, you just lost your owner about $2200\/yr in revenue, (that doesn't even include massages that I try to get quarterly) not to mention how many people I would have recommended this spa to and you have now also earned yourself a bad review on Yelp. All for $43. I hope it was worth it. As I was walking out, I asked for the intelligent staff member's name. ""Doreen"". I then said, ""Please thank Doreen for me."" Snotty blonde girl just gave me a smug look and said nothing. At some point, you need to suck up your pride and apologize to your customer. If not, people get mad and won't come back. Hence, I will take my business to one of the many other spas in Toronto.",Beauty
FhfJzqqTkOCmfOKKXvTkgQ,eBQAdKmnUg0j5sdKALPW7Q,xuD16x4Jlc__QMtl-AY6Xg,2012-07-09,"I had read that the Chinese food in Toronto is legendary, and since high-quality Chinese food in Chicago is so lacking, I made it a priority to find a top-class Chinese restaurant even if it meant having to drive out to the suburbs.  I settled on Emperor after reading some fine reviews, but I was a little concerned about not having a reservation (when we were dining in Vancouver, we were turned down by two or three restaurants because we didn't have reservations!).  We got there at six and the place was pretty much empty and we were seated promptly.  In the end, we decided to order a lobster yi-mian, sauteed beef cubes with snap peas in a bird's nest, and braised tofu with mushrooms and shrimp roe.  We were originally thinking about getting a lobster, but the price seemed to be a bit too high ($22\/lb for a normal lobster), so we went with the lobster yi-mian instead.  And man was it the right choice.  The noodles were not too soggy nor too dry, so it was the perfect texture.  And the lobster of course was very flavorful.  The sauteed beef was incredibly tender, and my mom declared it to be the most delicious beef she has had in a Chinese establishment.  The tofu was also very delicious though ultimately I thought it wasn't anything extraordinary.

Now while we were eating, there was this old couple sitting next to us who kept looking over at us.  Eventually, the wife had to speak up and asked us if we were from around here.  We said no, and she asked if we were aware of today's special.  We had seen the roasted pork special for only $1 on the menu but we thought you had to order the dinner sets to get the deal.  The old woman told us that there is a daily special and that today it was the roast pork and immediately flagged down a waiter and had him add an order of the roast pork to our table.  Such an incredibly nice woman!  The skin of the roast pork was very crispy (just the way I like it) while the meat was very juicy and tender.  We thanked the couple endlessly for their recommendation.

Now I'm not used to Chinese restaurants providing elaborate desserts.  Maybe a bowl of red bean soup or saigo, but nothing on the level that Emperor gave us.  Dessert consisted of a bowl of soup that had a lot of stuff in it (taro, red bean, rice, etc), a coconut bar, and some sort of cookie\/pastry.  Way beyond our expectations.  We felt like we were missing out on this quality of food and service - even back in California!

Now the only reason why I'm taking off one star is how they handled payment.  I was intending to use my credit card (which is how we tend to pay for food in the US!) but when the bill came they already incorporated a 10% discount if you used cash.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough cash, but we didn't think it would be a big issue for them to swipe my card.  But the first server said that because we had ordered the roast pig special, we had to pay in cash.  We said we didn't have enough Canadian dollars and eventually the manager came to us and made a deal.  He would have to remove the 10% discount and add another 3% as an administrative fee for using a credit card.  We agreed in the end, but I thought it was a bit inconvenient to always pay in cash, especially at a place like Emperor where dinner for a big group can probably grow to around $200 easily.  So for American visitors eating in the Richmond Hill\/Markham areas, remember to bring plenty of cash for your meals!",Restaurant

You have 24 hours to eat at any of 7 different hotels buffets for only $50. If you get a players card it is $45 but remember in order to get the discount each adult will need to get a players card. We managed to have 4 meals and ate at 3 different buffets.
Day 1:
-6:00pm We started off with dinner at Planet Hollywoods Spice Market Buffet.
  Overall: 4 stars
  Line: ~30 min
  Ambiance: Decor is simple and modern. Movie posters on the wall :)
  Buffet set up: really nice and easy to follow
  Food:The food here was really delicious. It was flavorful and they had a really big variety of foods including Mediterranean, Asian, Seafood, Mexican, and American. Some of my favorite dishes was the warm crab legs, prime rib, skewered tandoori chicken and beef. Their deserts were to die for, especially for me who has a huge sweet tooth. They had a crepe making station, cotton candy, yummy creme brulee, and don't be fooled by the soft serve machine. I thought it was just regular ice cream but nope it was vanilla custard soft serve which had a really thick creamy texture.

Day 2:
-9:00 Le Village Buffet at Paris Paris
  Overall: 4 stars
   Line: ~40 min
   Ambiance: Cozy and cute. Decorated true to its theme, like a Parisan village
   Buffet set up: This is why I I couldnt award it 5 stars. The buffet set up was very muddled and it was difficult to find things. Some food items were somewhat hidden behind lines of people waiting for omelets and crepes. Also these stations had extremely long lines. It was alot less organized than Planet Hollywood and other buffets I have been to.
   Food: Food was really good. I am not really a big breakfast person but I really enjoyed that even though the spread was your typical breakfast foods they had a variety of each food. For example they had several different types of sausages, I tried andouille which was really good.I also tried the banana nutella crepe with candied walnuts which was sugary bliss. Make sure you have the rosemary red potatoes!

We planned on having Caesars for lunch but unfortunately the information desk told us the buffet had closed down a few days ago. This was a little ridiculous since Caesars was listed on most of the ads and was even on our wristbands. Nevertheless we took it in our stride and decided to try Harrahs.

-1:00 Flavors Buffet at Harrahs
  Overall: 2 stars
  Line: ~20 min which was really ridiculous because the restaurant was not packed at all. 
  Ambiance:Simple but clean
  Buffet set up: Easy to follow however alot of the sauces were unaccessable. Also alot of the deserts are behind glass so you have to ask an attendant.
 Food: None of the dishes were exceptional but nothing was bad either... Cookies and cream gelato was really good though.

-5:00 Spice Market Buffet Round 2!
 Yep it was that good! We decided to go again so we could end our buffet experience on a good note and it was 100% worth it. I got to really enjoy all the dishes I liked the previous night. Best part was there was no line when we arrived!

Thing to keep in mind:
-There are lines so make sure you go with people you like, anybody the is a wet blanket or picky eater will ruin the experience. I was lucky that everyone I was with were down for anything so it was really fun.
-To get the most bang for your buck have a late dinner one night and then have breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day. Remember it's 24 hours.
-Be open minded and just have fun with it! Treat it like an adventure and you will be good to go.",Restaurant

(Down below, after I voice my complaints, I talk about how much I love this doctor.  Please be sure to read to that part.  My complaints about his staff, although highly annoying, are something that the doctor could easily fix with a re-train session.  I suspect the doctor does not yet realize how inadequate his staff's service can be.  If you are in the market for a good doctor, you might want to try him anyway....  Maybe he will have seen this post and fixed the situation by then? )

Here are a few examples:  

1.  Stopped being a patient over a year and a half ago--moved out of state.  I even withdrew as a patient before I left.   But, despite me telling them I am moving (and deactivating my patient file) and no matter how many times I hit unsubscribe at the bottom of the emails, their automated system won't stop emailing me.  I have even called their office twice....no matter what I do, they keep putting me back on the list.  

A couple of times I went off their list for a month or so...then suddenly there it is again-- two to four emails per week.  .  The latest excuse I got was that they just started using a new email system but really?  How many new systems could they have possibly gotten?  This has been going on for a year and a half now.    

This isn't limited to email.  I have moved twice since I have been a member of their practice, but even though I don't update my mailing address they find me anyway.  They keep sending me ""time for your eye exam"" post cards in the mail.  How they keep finding me, I'll never know.  (Could they be a front for the CIA...naw our government is clearly not this efficient at tracking people down!)

2.  First time I ordered contacts through their staff, the only option was to have them sent to the office.  I got a call in the middle of the afternoon one day saying my contacts had arrived to their office but the box that was ripped open--and did they want me to accept the delivery anyway?  I asked if any of the contacts were damaged or missing from the order--they said they had no way of knowing.  I asked if they could check--they said no, they couldn't open the box unless I accepted the order.  I asked what happened if I accepted the order, whether they would replace anything that was missing or damaged?  They said no they wouldn't.  

Clearly that was pure ignorance talking.  They had charged me money, never delivered the product they charged me for--they obviously could not charge me if the order was incorrect..  Undoubtedly the doctor would have fixed the problem if I had to take it to him directly.... but that was the sort of thing that happened every time I went there.

3 By the following year, they offered to have the contacts delivered directly to your house at no additional charge.  YAY!  Well....it would have been yay if they had done it....but instead I got a call a couple weeks later saying my order had arrived into the office and I needed to come pick it up  (I had to make a 40 minute drive due to their mistake.)

On that same order, I was supposed to get a rebate.  First they gave me an expired rebate form.  I called back to get a new copy--they forgot to mail it.  

4 Later, I was traveling overseas and needed a copy of my prescription--of course they forgot to email it to me.  When I called back, they emailed me one that had expired well over a year before.  Finally, just before I left, and after several calls--I got the prescription I needed.

5 The other major problem is the upselling.  Go in for an exam... and they offer every high-tech exam option, contacts, glasses, an extra pair of glasses, sunglasses, accessories....and everything else you can think of.  I have had less pressure buying a new car.  (Seriously.  That sounds like I am exaggerating, but sadly I am not.)

Now that I have told you the bad....let me stress that I LOVE this eye doctor.  He really seems to care about eye health.  He goes out of his way to have the most high-tech diagnostic equipment available.  He is happy to take as long as you need to get a thorough exam, answer any questions you have, etc.  He is personable, charming, professional, and I always knew my eyesight was in GREAT hands!  Really, really, really LOVED this guy!!!!  (His office was also clean, in a great location, and it was always easy to get an appointment.)

I just wish that I had received the same level of professionalism from his staff as I did from him.",Shopping
cYCp4gteXrwxxx4z8MKAgA,oSBMTgBvaLzA9RxzOlt6Fg,KGDKa42EVVFOvdgDahBApw,2015-01-03,"Having relocated from NYC, maybe my standards are just too high for Vegas. I'm used to definitive answers, prompt service, and great value (contrary to popular belief, quality salon services are quite affordable in NYC if you know where to look due to the hyper competitive environment) and I just did not get that here.

I made an appointment earlier this week to get my hair done today with Ellice after finding the salon on Groupon and reviewing the Yelp reviews on here. I noted I found them via Groupon and spoke with her on the phone about what I was looking to get done. She asked if I had purchased the Groupon yet and said ""Oh, good!"" when I told her I hadn't, then insisted I not purchase the Groupon, noting she would honor the price (to save herself the fees, of course--typically Groupon charges businesses 50% of the voucher price!). I obliged as I understand what it is like to own a business and have friends that own small businesses. She DID mention there may be a slight up charge if I have a lot of hair or very long hair but was very vague with the exact costs.

When I got to the salon today, I sat down and she says the up charge would be either $20 or $40 yet could not give me a definitive answer as to which one despite a) looking at my hair in detail \/ feeling it and brushing it so she obviously knows the thickness and length and b) my asking repeatedly. First red flag there--an experienced stylist SHOULD be able to eyeball approximately how much color is needed if they see your hair in person. 1 tube extra or 2 tubes extra is a wide range and you should be able to narrow it down to approx. 1 tube or approx. 1.5-1.75 (aka 2 tubes). Also, it just seemed shady to me to begin with considering that in my 10+ years of getting my hair colored and highlighted at various salons in NYC, using Groupon deals the majority of the time, I have never once had to deal with an up charge and my hair was longer\/thicker before I moved here (I had it layered to reduce the thickness and cut shorter a few months back).

I mentioned that if it was $40 extra, it would not be worth it for me to take a risk on their services since it is my first time. Yes, I don't mind paying for quality but how do I know its quality if I've never tried it and everyone's hair is different? While she\/they may be great at caucasian hair, they could totally butcher Asian hair (this has happened to me countless times before).

Since I am taking a risk and looking for a new go-to salon now that I've relocated here, I noted I am willing to pay the extra $20 but not $40 as that would make the total more than what I would pay in NYC for a cut & color at my trusted stylists AND more than all the other local salons' REGULAR prices (I got quotes from 2 others with just as great\/better reviews on Yelp) so in essence, I would not be getting any discount. Also, considering that I did not buy the Groupon per their request, they would be getting an extra $34.50 from me than they typically do from Groupon customers since they're not paying Groupon the 50% fee so if they were good business people and could do math, they would realize that they've more than recouped the ""extra costs."" My mother has owned a salon before so I know how much professional hair color costs and it sure as hell is nowhere near the $20 per tube they quoted, even if they use high end products.

All in all, this business is just run very poorly and perhaps Ellice is a good stylist but management is not welcoming to new clients apparently. There are plenty of salons who will appreciate your business and are looking to attract new clients in Vegas so I would go elsewhere. Its one thing if you're marketing yourself as a high end salon and charging high end prices but this is a neighborhood salon, not the most convenient location, not the most high end, and offering a so-called ""deal"" on Groupon to attract new clients yet adding extra charges when you show up so that the ""deal"" is no longer a ""deal""...just reminded me of my awful car buying experience and all the extra fees once they get you through the door! 

At the end of everything, I did not get my hair done with them as it appears to be a business\/salon that wants to nickel & dime their customers more than they want new clients. They were completely unwilling to budge on capping the up charge even when I stated I would be fine with $20 (about 29% of the $69 groupon) if they could just cap it at that.

2 stars instead of 1 for the fact that Ellice was friendly throughout the whole discussion\/ordeal despite her manager \/ the owner's poor business development and customer service skills.

Lastly, as a seasoned Yelper--I would caution you all to be wary of businesses with many reviews from individuals with a) less than 10 reviews and b) no photo(s) of themselves as oftentimes, friends & family write biased reviews.",Beauty
CUgEjaW8JAFDfPCInO4TsQ,IR2onYnXM0FPOyt5HjLdrQ,OQvChaBImI8X5B3aai8btg,2017-11-07,"I wrote a blog post about Waffles Incaffeinated and figured I'd share it here: https:\/\/www.nataliezazula.com\/adventure\/2017\/11\/2\/my-favorite-brunch-waffles-incaffeinated

Waffles Incaffeinated is unassuming both inside and out. It is located on E. Carson St near the corner of 25th Street in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood. It sits between the office of a State Farm Insurance agent and another restaurant called Wings Over Pittsburgh.

The entry is a little cramped but once you've cleared the server podium the floor space opens. The exterior walls have a black pattern on them while interior walls are painted a bright pea green for contrast. The floor is a light wood and all tables and chairs are made of black metal.  The wall in the back of the restaurant is decorated with three large photos of waffles and it is glorious!

Now, people don't come here for the ambiance. It does it's job and is clean and well appointed but it is nothing special. The food is what makes the restaurant.

Waffles
If the name didn't tell you, Waffles Incaffeinated specializes in waffles. Leslie Knope would love it here! Actually, a friend and I had brunch here on February 13th to celebrate Galentine's Day! #ParksandRec

Anyway, the waffles are the focal point and for good reason. They have savory and they have sweet. If you want a normal plain waffle, you can get that. However, you would be doing yourself a disservice.

Savory Waffles
I swear by the Chicken & Waffles.

They are so DELICIOUS! You get a plate sized waffle topped with fried chicken strips. Here is the website description: ""A Southern classic consisting of a pecan infused waffle with boneless, thick breaded, fried chicken pieces coated with a maple butter glaze and topped with scallions."" The meal tastes as amazing as it sounds. They also provide multiple syrup options but I also go for the traditional maple (it is infused with vanilla). The waffle is the perfect texture and the flavors all complement each other so darn well.

My friends, Lindsey and Julie, love the Country Benedict and Breakfast Magic. Both of those entrees come with eggs. Here are the respective menu descriptions: ""Two waffle quarters, each topped with a piece of fried chicken, that is smothered with our house made sausage gravy, and crowned with two fried eggs any way you like them"" and ""Crisp bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and green onion on the inside topped with more bacon and cheddar cheese create the perfect resting place for a fried egg* just the way you like! garnished with green onion and a swoosh of sour cream, magical!""

Sweet Waffles
Now, years ago I would get the Funky Monkey as my meal. It was a chocolate chip waffle covered with fresh bananas and a homemade peanut butter chiffon. It was essentially a heavenly peanut butter mousse. Oh, there was chocolate sauce on top as well! So amazing but it is definitely for dessert and not brunch now. I am unsure how I was able to eat that and feel satisfied for more than an hour.

I've also had the Bananas Foster's before and again...wow. The menu reads: ""Our take on the classic! walnuts inside and out, topped with bananas and a cool mound of vanilla bean ice cream, then smothered with our foster's sauce!""

Now, let is be known that if you want a sweet AND savory waffle, you have the option of creating your own! There are over thirty mix-in and topping options ranging from coconut to cinnamon and crab to spicy sausage.

Non-Waffles
It has been a hot second since I've had anything other than a waffle as my entree but I can attest that Waffles Incaffeinated has delicious omelets as well. They are referred to as O-My-Lettes here and I know why. They are scrumptious!

The menu has five pre-designed omelettes but just as you can build your own waffle, you can create your own omlette! Seriously, even if you aren't a waffle lover you will still enjoy Waffles Incaffeinated.

I can also let you know that the side of potatoes is amazing! Perfectly crispy potatoes with green peppers and onions. Wow. I always finish mine and help my friends if they cannot finish theirs!",Restaurant
zjNIy4NA1F665oTdoeaxUg,135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A,t-6tdxRaz7s9a0sf94Tguw,2015-05-18,"I had been wanting to try Impressionz for a long while, since it fits the profile of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant--a little-known hole in the wall with great food.  I finally received the opportunity to do so this Sat. evening, since I needed to make a Target run.  Since CM was shuttling me over and was hungry for dinner, I suggested it, and after parking in the garage, we headed a block or two over to check it out.

Although I'd never had Jamaican cuisine before, I did some research on Wikipedia beforehand and learned that salt fish and ackee was a traditional dish.  Since I didn't know how spicy the jerk chicken would be, and I wanted to try a more unique dish, I had to order it when I saw it on the MTO section of the menu ($18).  CM, on the other hand, decided to stick to what he knows and went with the small jerk chicken ($10.50).  While we were waiting for our entrees, CM ordered a beef patty ($2.50), and I ordered a bottle of Ting grapefruit soda.  Although I don't eat beef, I decided to break my rule for a split second and ate a corner with a tiny bit of the filling.  The pastry was quite flaky, and the filling was well seasoned, which helped to mask the flavor of the beef.  CM assured me that the rest was quite tasty.

Despite being told that MTO entrees take 20 min. to make, my entree seemed to come out faster than expected (in about 15 min., I believe, though I wasn't timing it), and CM's was brought out immediately afterward.  My entree was more savory than I would have guessed, and had just the right amount of fishiness.  The ratios of ingredients seemed well-balanced, and it was huge--so much so that the sides of rice, cabbage, and plantains came on an additional plate (see photo).  Though it came on a single plate with sides, CM's jerk chicken, which consisted of a quarter dark meat, was also portioned generously.  Between the large portion and the spiciness of the jerk sauce, he took half home for later enjoyment, along with some of the left over sides.

As others have mentioned, the only part of our experience that bested the food was the service from Cecilia and her family.  Cecilia is very personable, and was very good about answering our questions about the menu.  Her daughters were there as well, and were adorable.  We could tell that Impressionz attracts regular customers, probably from the local neighborhood, by the rapport that they had with Cecilia.

The quality and amount of food, as well as the caliber of service, at Impressionz lived up to the hype, and then some.  (CM agreed, saying it was better than a Jamaican restaurant he frequented in Ann Arbor.)  However, I'm not awarding a full 5 stars because (1) I felt the MTO dishes were a bit overpriced, esp. for a cash only place (even in light of the portion size) and (2) I think I would have enjoyed a different dish more (though this was my fault for choosing it...) The only other major downside was that the bathroom's currently out of service due to a flood that occurred in Mar. Nevertheless, I highly recommend checking out this neighborhood jewel! 4.5 stars.",Restaurant
m_MMPgF7eAhOy5A459BGDg,CHvqnjqyBRuBRL4Zrog80w,mmKrNeBIIevuNljAWVNgXg,2015-08-23,"My appointment was at 9:30am Saturday morning.  To my surprise the place was empty, I was the only customer.  It was like that for my first 40 minutes.  I was happy it wasn't crowded because they got me seated straight away. 

 I got the Summer package which included the Gel mani $20 (normally $25) and the Pedi that included Paraffin  wax, sugar scrub, hot rocks, callus removal,  $35 (normally $40).   

I didn't catch the guys name but the gals was Tammi. They both made me feel comfortable and relaxed.  I felt like I was talking with a friend.  That's rare to find.  The guy did a great job on the pedicure and even though he doesn't do designs, he was able to do the polka dots I wanted.  Tammi teased him about it.  LOL     
 One caveat,  to the pedi package I got; instead of doing the paraffin wax separate, he put a swipe of it on my legs and then topped it with the sugar scrub.  I'm pretty sure this would have worked nicer if they were done separate.

Next up my Gel mani.  This is where they lost stars.  The guys is not all that good at manicures.  I asked him not to clip my nails but  use the file to shape.  Well, he got carried away with the nail filer and my nails are shorter than I wanted.  They are not nicely rounded on the corners either.  

The worst part came, at no fault of his, just bad gel polish I think, when he was putting on the clear gel coat, it bubbled.  He asked if I used soap to wash my hands, of which I had not.   He used the electric drill to remove it and then buffed out the nails then had me wash my hands again and specified, no soap.  

We started over again and the bubbles appeared again.  I asked if maybe it's the detergent in the towels that used to dry my hands with.    They didn't think so.  The gal thought it may be bc I touched my hair and the oils from my hair was causing it.  (I really didn't think so).  Regardless, I do not swipe away my hair that gets into my face.  

So he proceeded to use the electric drill again and buff out my nails and I washed my hands again.  At this point my nails are sore.  I'm about to say forget the damn gel.  (really after the second time they should have grabbed a different bottle of gel polish)

So the gal comes over to do it, thinking it's something that he is doing.  Nope.  It starts bubbling right away.  So what she had to do, was do one or two fingers at a time and put them under the light real quick.  That seemed to help.  

I think that this mani did not have to go so bad if they would have just grabbed a new bottle of gel.  My nails went through a lot of abuse because they continued to do the same thing over and over.  

To rectify it, they could have offered a discount.  Instead, all I got was the offer that Tammi would do my nails next time.  

I think that these are two of the nicest nail techs I've ever met and I would love to come back if the service was better.  I would only go to guy for the pedicure and Tammi for the mani.


RANT BEGINS ABOUT NAIL SALONS IN GENERAL:

I've been to quit a few nail salons looking for one that offers the top quality service and quality work that I am paying for .

What I've noticed, is that instead of the customers demanding quality service, they are in the mind frame, that all of this is normal and not to demand better.  

WE ARE PAYING FOR THIS SERVICE.
 
 We deserve, to be worked on right away if we booked a time slot.  

We deserve to be treated with respect and not have nail techs talk about us bc they think we won't notice when  their doing it in foreign tongue.  

We deserve to have quality products used on us rather than old, gunky crap.  

We deserve to have professional nail techs who give quality work.

We deserve to have longer hot rock massages if I'm paying extra for it.  One minute per leg doesn't cut it.

We deserve a lot more than we are receiving.  None of this crap that goes on in nail salons should be accepted.  

It is time for customers to stand up for our rights.  Nail salons are a dime a dozen.
It's the ones that give top service that stand out and are winners in my book.",Beauty
T2STDRd0Pd4hthUZShq4Mg,QFQGMnOEoqii9ttB9t-RXg,NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ,2012-07-16,"This is a true little gem.  I am perhaps the world's greatest critics of Indian \/ Nepalese restaurants as I know what I like and they often don't live up to my standards.  I've got my favourite restaurants that I frequent and I do often try others but 99% of the time I leave disappointed.  

I'm very happy to say that when I went to The Gurkha Cafe this was the other 1%.  I was anything but disappointed!!!  

The interior of this place is really cool, it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling.  I felt as thought I'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door.  The interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants in Edinburgh.  

I saw someone at the table next to me drinking a Nepalese Gurkha beer so I decided when in Rome...  It was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for £4.95 for 660mls it wasn't so cheap.  Worth it for the label though.  

I went for the Mo Mo Cha Nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried.  I went for steamed and was SO glad that I did as they were delicious.  I was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty.  They were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them - I'm sure I had at least 5 and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion sizes!  What made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it.  I couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number.  I want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but I hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that.  No matter what was in it, it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category.  

My companion had the chicken satay to start with.  This wasn't the usual Asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a Nepalese twist.  The size of this dish could have easily passed for a main course!  There were huge chunks of chicken under a rich, tomato \/ barbeque style sauce.  As I said, not like the usual peanut style satay but still good.  Not as good as my dumplings though - top tip!!!  :)

Another good thing about this place (to add to the huge list) is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements.  

For main course I ordered the chicken korma.  When ordering in fact, I asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what I liked.  I know a lot of people think, 'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life.  The tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal.  That's what I love about Nepalese even more than Indian restaurants, they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours.  Yummy!!!  Again the portion sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating until I'd finished it all.  

My fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if I remember correctly.  It came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation.  The quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable, we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full I'm sure.  She only managed a quarter of it as it was!  As I said above, although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly.  

We ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main courses.  The nan was lovely, lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices.  

This place really does have it all - you can't get a more central location, the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful, good friendly service and a different yet cool interior.  It's a winner!!!  

As if you can't tell already, I love this place.  Take whatever I've written and imagine I love it 100% more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much I enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant.  Honestly, the only thing left to say is try it for yourself.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed and if you are then you can always take the left overs away for me:)",Restaurant

There are some days where comfort food makes everything better.  I was not in the mood for meatloaf or some heavy fried chicken, even though I was dying for fried food.  On the way home, we stumbled on a small eatery called Tonkatsu Kiyoshi on Jones and Robindale.  Tonkatsu sounded wonderful for dinner.  Crispy, marinated, fried pork was just the thing to make my frown turn upside-down.

Upon entering the small eatery, there are about 3 tables that seat up to six people, and a nice, large counter seating 5.  We sat at the counter and was greeted by a very nice gentleman who explained the menu layout.  The menu is very simple--it's katsu, either chicken, salmon, thick cut pork, or pork tenderloin, ebi furai, curry combos, and apps.  The appetizers are the typical karaage, cucumber and krab meat salad, seared beef with onions and ponzu, and edamame.  We ordered karaage, krab meat salad, and seared beef.

Before the food arrived, the server explained their sauce tray seated in front of us.  There is a container of sesame seeds, one of katsu sauce, hot pepper, salt, pepper, and soy sauce.


We were told to put sesame in the grinding bowl that doubles as our dipping sauce bowl, and to grind the sesame seeds to a powder.

It was quite fun grinding up the sesame seeds and taking in the scent of the nutty oils releasing in the bowl.  We mixed in the katsu sauce and some hot pepper with our chopsticks, then awaited the main course.

The apps came out quickly.  First up was the cucumber salad with krab meat.  It's sweet and tangy from the vinegar, balancing the sweetness of the shredded krab stick.  The cucumber was a nice, crunchy, and fresh element to the app.  It also acts as a great palate cleanser.

For $5 you get a ton of salad.  I almost ate the whole bowl without sharing with my husband.

The next app that arrived was the seared beef with onions and ponzu.  We were told that some people like to roll the onions into the meat then dip, which I tried.

I added in the radish (on the right) and some chives into the sauce, rolled the raw white onions in the meat, then dipped.  It was delicious and very cold, which was refreshing.  The meat was good quality and seared beautifully.

If there is anything in the world I love, it is fried chicken or karaage, and this eatery makes the lightest, crispiest, and most flavorful karaage I have tried in Vegas.  They marinate the meat in mirin, soy, and other ingredients for a day or two, then they lightly batter it with seasoned rice flour and serve with a vinaigrette salad and lemon.  I squeezed lemon over the chicken, gently dropped soy on each piece, and took a bite.  The crispy, light exterior was just heaven.  The salad on the side balanced the hot fried chicken pieces, providing tasty, cool relief from the hot and crispy chicken.  


With a burst of cherry tomato in my mouth mixed in with the salad, this could be a great lunch dish on its own.  Just lovely.

After all those appetizers came the combination plate that I ordered -- fried shrimp with tenderloin katsu.  It's served with Rokkyo (Japanese pickled onions), miso soup, hot rice, and ponzu for the cabbage.

The katsu is served on this awesome metal rack to keep all sides crispy.

The katsu was juicy and crispy, with that lovely coating that wasn't too thick.  The shrimp (ebi furai) was delicious.  I love ebi furai and they make it very well here.  With the cabbage covered in ponzu sauce, some Rokkyo to cut through the richness of the katsu, and some hot rice to compliment everything else, I didn't look up once through the entire meal.  It was just so much fun to dip in the katsu sesame sauce and then reach for rice, then drink some miso to balance everything.  In the end, I raped my plate of all its parts and tapped my tummy in approval.

But what--we cannot end a meal on entree alone.  A light, sweet dessert is required here, and what better to eat than a cream puff.  A cream puff that is made fresh, powdered with sugar, and filled generously with a whipped cream made in-house was the perfect way to end this ""ichiban"" meal.  The cream was silky and had just the right sweetness, with a puff that wasn't crispy as it was chewy and light.  Perfect ending to my day, indeed.

After paying the good man $56 for 2 drinks. 2 entress, 3 apps, and 2 desserts, my husband and I shuffled our cartoon-like full bellies into the car and headed home to hibernate.  I love places that have simple menus, provide good food and service, are very clean, and are priced well.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi hits all those marks, which only means that they are on my go-to list when I am in dire need of a katsu, karaage, or ebi furai mix.  Thank you, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, for making my day brighter and my belly full.",Restaurant

I went in for a full set and to get my eyebrows waxed. I got my eye brows done first and it went horribly. I have really thick brows and just wanted them to clean them up. I laid down and I heard barking. They had a 4 month old pug in the other room. He had begun barking and whining loudly and she BOUGHT THE DOG INTO THE ROOM WITH US. He began whining and walking around and she was talking to him as she did my brows. How unsanitary is that? then she put the wax on. It was touching my eye lid and was burning my skin. She saw me wincing and said pain is beauty and laughed. I made the comment my worst fear is having thin brows so keep them thick. She held the mirror up and I began to have a panic attack. My right brow was a straight line, and paper thin, My left eyebrow was arched, thin, and looked uneven. I began to cry and she tried to keep me in the room saying dont cry dont cry. I ran out the room and outside and began to cry my eyes out. I called my mom, and she told me to go to sephora immediately. My husband who was getting a pedicure came running outside and saw me bawling and immediately saw my brows. The woman who butchered them came out as well, telling me she would give me a free full set and free pedicure but kept saying calm down. My husband asked me what I wanted to do and I told him I still needed my nails done. They did my set and that was butchered as well. They are all uneven, and painted terribly. I hate them so much and am wondering if I should go somewhere else to fix them. I didnt have to pay them a cent but ended up having to pay 40.00 for makeup to fix my damn eyebrow. I am so angry and furious. I will never go back.


UPDATE:

oooh child, let me tell you a story about a woman who didnt know when to stop when she was ahead. I came back to this hell hole because I admit they can do a flawless full set. I came in, with my mother, and look whose at the desk but the woman (not the word I wanted to use but I am lady) who removed my eyebrow. I sit down, to a different girl I think was named Jennifer who did a fantastic job might I add, So the woman who removes eyebrows, comes up to me and says hey honey, how you doing, its been awhile since we seen you. I didnt even look at her and said well yea, you ripped my eyebrow off. She  fucking leans against me, and puts her hand on my shoulder. If you need to know anything about me, know I fucking hate being touched. I looked at her and said your touching me. And she just stares me and I say I dont like being touched and she finally takes her hands off me. She then goes to say wheres your boyfriend, and at this point I am furious. I point to my big ass ring on my hand and say you mean my husband? She then acts all shocked saying oh you married? girl please, at this point I wanted to enjoy my full set and I wanted her to stay the hell away from me. So everything is going good, I love my fullset, they look amazing, but im not sure if 45.00 is worth it. We go to pay, and this bitch (remover of eyebrows) says I was wondering if you could help me with something, and I just stare at her, and what does she do???
SHE PULLS UP MY YELP REVIEW ON HER PHONE SHOWS IT TO ME AND ASKS IF ITS ME?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Now I am just in full rage mood. I tell her yes, and she goes on saying how much trouble she got in with her boss, how her boss said she should have made sure I was happy and she looks at me and said which I dont understand because I gave you free everything. I said um no you paid for my nails and husbands feet but you didnt replace my goddamn eyebrow. I then start yelling saying do you fucking realize I can sue you and shut this place down, YOU BROUGHT A DOG INTO AN ENCLOSED ROOM WITH ME!!!!!!!!!!!! she then tells me the dog was a one of their customers dogs, I flip out. I have an auto immune disease so germs can do a lot more damage to me then the normal person, I even told her, you didnt know if I was allergic to dogs, but my husband is!!!!!!!! You could have killed both of us, I even told her, I could sue you for everything this place is worth and I do have a lawyer on retainer for rainy fucking days like this. She then keeps saying repeatedly how much trouble she got in with owner, and how the owner chewed her out, So I said ya know what, give me your bosses number. She wrote a number on a piece of paper, and I walked out. I called the number and I asked the girl who answered if she was the owner and she said no wrong number and hung up. I called the nail place back, and read the number out loud to her, and she said omg I am so sorry I gave you my parents number! She had to go searching for the ""real"" number,and I have called 3 times with no answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am beyond furious. Apparently this place wants to be sued.",Beauty

And anyone reviewing the company well must be lying. Now location to location you'll get different staff, which is the only positive remark ill make in this entire review following that the people who work at the charleston location I just adored. They were clean and prompt.. Most of the time. 

They don't try heavily to upsell the products, which was nice considering for unlimited tanning you're already looking at a price of around $100. I'm not a serious tanner but was looking for a good salon since I'd just moved here from SF and was applying to jobs and hitting the end of the pool party season. 

The groupon I started with was fair, $25 for 2 spray tans or 2 bed sessions, which you had to specify one or the other, not interchangeable. But problem #1 I came to find I couldn't use two $25 two-spray coupons because they were one per customer to start. Well OKAY I guess, so I gave the other one to my boyfriend for when he'd visit. Mind you they had a 4-bed session $50-some groupon, but not a larger spray package for the same.

So by the end of my groupon they convinced me as a groupon customer I'd only pay $94 for unlimited. I signed a contract and the young lady warned me that by signing I'd be promising a minimum of two months before I could cancel, and I said that was okay. Through December and January I was a tan and happy camper. 

Once end of January rolled around, however, holiday pay had ended at my job and hours got cut like crazy. I knew I wasn't going to be able to afford my package till closer to summer when hours would come back around. My last day of tanning for the month of january, I told the boy at the counter, who had informed me he was new (I asked since I'd never seen him among the other TF associates) that I wasn't going to be able to afford the package anymore and I wanted to cancel. As I left I double checked with him that he understood what I needed from him, and he agreed and waved me goodbye. What a relief I thought, and I'd see them in a few months (tear).

Around the end of May my credit card was reflecting numerous charges from something I'd never heard of, BodyHeat tanning, and I was extremely puzzled. I went back a couple months and saw I'd gotten a charge of $5.50 for the months of February and March, stated as ""TANFACTORY BODYHE LAS VEGAS NV"" so I put it together and read these other reviews stating their name change. So what made it okay for them to charge two months of $5.50, noneless I got the full package charge of $94 for all of April and May! I hadn't gone since January 29th, and they scan your finger to attach to your account. So there is proof I hadn't gone in forever. I call the charleston store and they tell me to call corporate. Of course it's a holiday weekend and a Saturday nonetheless so I had to wait until today, inching days closer to June where another month will be charged. I left a voicemail with billing, no call returned.

So today I've now had to call billing back (THIS IS THE BEST PART) who tells me you need to petition by email or fax to get yourself unsigned with the company... BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE! I ask her where this is stated and she says in the contract I signed half a year ago. So not only have I been charged $300 for not showing up somewhere, but no one, including the young man at the counter, the manager, nor the girl who signed me up, told me this ONCE. So thank you Tanl Factory, or BodyHeat, or whoever the hell you guys are, for sucking us into this nonsense.

Now maybe I should've read the fine print and asked more questions before signing, but as someone who works in retail opening credit accounts through an outside company my CUSTOMER SERVICE knowledge pushes me to discuss the pamphlet we give to new account holders, nonetheless I urge customers to read it as give them a quick brief on what to expect, such as our extremely high interest rate and the issues that come with revolving accounts.

So point being that though the staff is friendly and kind and the place is kept clean (what more do they have to do besides sit on their phones at the desk), the customer service regarding these death contracts are just not worth it in the long run unless you're tanorexic and come enough and you have a extremely steady job to support this madness. You'd think with so much time on their hands they'd explain the fine print. You'd have a better shot elsewhere my fellow yelpers, and mind you I don't write negative reviews EVER. I prefer to praise a company rather than write a bad review, but I've had just enough of this BS.",Beauty
0Oa_FUN3geo_5poPacGA3g,TBLdjYJMIDaM6dB23AenLw,gsCQ77tK2lXxmsPjcv-vFQ,2012-06-12,"I love Sephora, but their prices keep me away for long periods of time (mainly cause I'm saving up to afford to shop here again).

I've been to this location a few times, but finely decided to Yelp about it today due to the fabulous customer service I received today. I originally came here to buy that super cool Ciate Caviar nail polish ($25) for my friend for her birthday. Well, then I saw the Too Faced section and thought, ""hmm, I haven't been here in awhile so let's go see what they have"" (side note: yes, that was a stupid idea, but I'm female and have shopping issues). Well, since its getting hot as balls outside, I wanted to look for a face primer that would help hydrate my skin and also keep my foundation on when I do decide to wear it in the summer months. Great, found one that feels silky smooth on the back of my hand, done ($30). Oh look, what's that *reaches for the Coconut Oil Body Bronzer* ($35). ""Doesn't that smell delicious"" says one of the employees ""it smells like I'm in heaven drinking a piña colada"" I reply. The super cute employee then proceeds to put a dab a bit on my arm and make it look all shimmery and bronzy. My subconscious then tells me to snap out of it and I reply, ""thanks for the sample, I'll have to think about it"". She states ""no problem, but here, let me show you the other popular bronzer by NARS "" and she proceeds to walk me over to another fab makeup brand and apply their bronzer ($45) on my other arm and it makes me look all summery and pretty (but the Too Faced smelled way better). I reluctantly say ""thanks for giving me options, I'll have to think about which one I want and come back later"" and start making my way to the check out counter with my two items, even though I really wanted that Too Faced bronzer.

So there I am, waiting to check out with two customers in front of me abut then all of a sudden, I ended up in their perfume section being helped by another friendly and helpful employee. I tell her I wasn't sure if it was the fact that I had be drinking a lot or that the perfume a girl was wearing at the bar smelled really good and I wanted to see if they had it, it's by a Victor and Rolph. ""Flowerbomb"" she replies and then proceeds to spray sample of one of those paper things and also gives me a history on this perfume (it's been around for eight years). I instantly fall in love and tell her that I would love to get some, but I don't need a lot cause I don't wear perfume that much (maybe once every two weeks). She goes through all the different sizes, sprays, dab-ons, and roller ball types, and I end up getting the smallest spray size ($50). I then finally ignore the rest of the store and check out...

This store has everything! Makeup, skincare, fragrance, bath\/body, tools\/accessories, nail polish, and even a men's section. Brands include: the Art of Shaving, Bare Escentuals, BCBG, Betsey Johnson, Bobbi Brown, Burberry, oh gosh, I'm only on the 'b's, they have almost every brand you could imagine here and the customer service is always great!

Recap: I would give this place 5 stars, but the fact that three items, that could all fit in one hand, total $114, leaves me not being able to afford the extra star; I really want that Too Faced Coconut Oil Bronzer; and I blame the two customers in front of me for ultimately making me get the perfume ;)",Shopping
YlbP1bxF7jXAVQkFVOv3cg,3okybxTquQnYO5t50tNB6Q,Ca-ih2GH_WU_antKSs4mjA,2014-02-12,"I have been to Bricco twice thus far and I think it's a good addition to the Kent restaurant scene but it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  

Bricco bills itself as an upscale contemporary American-Italian restaurant and based on the highly lauded Akron location I had high hopes.  Every think I've eaten here has been good but not the ""great"" I was expecting.  More specifics if you can stand to read it follows:

Service has been A+ each time.  The first time, the server was obviously new to the profession but very nice and attentive.  The second visit, the server was seasoned, friendly and attentive.  He apologized several times for the wait on our food and (I think) forgot to bring us bread (unless that only comes with pasta) but I didn't care about either of those things so no points taken.


The appetizer BANANA PEPPERS stuffed with italian sausage and chorizo rice was yummy and spicy and a good start to the meal on visit #1. 

For an entree I ordered the ""baked PENNE with italian SAUSAGE, caramelized onions, mozzarella cheese and banana peppers in a PINK SAUCE "" and it was ok but pretty much like any penne with store-bought meat sauce I've ever made at home.  (I clarify because I've had better penne with homemade meat sauce...mmm)  

My date also ordered pasta this visit - going for the ""ANGEL HAIR tossed with BLACKENED CHICKEN, green onions, diced tomatoes and a CAJUN CREAM sauce.""  I think he liked it and I got to try to and thought it was also just ok.  I wasn't wowed since I think Red Lobster has (had?) a similar dish that tastes exactly the same.  

Visit #2 we tried the tomato and artichoke soup which is the BEST thing I've had here and super recommended.  Chunky, creamy, flavorful and divine with fresh ground black pepper (which they had on the table!!)  For my own future reference, I think this soup + a salad would be a knockout pair.

For an entree I went with the ""WAFFLE-BATTERED AIRLINE CHICKEN breast with white cheddar GRITS and maple butter"" and my date ordered the ""grilled PORK TENDERLOIN with bacon and corned beef HASH and sauteed RAPINI.""

I love chicken + sweetness of maple syrup or honey and, again, my expectations were not quite met.  The batter was pretty delicious although it tasted more like Funnel Cake than waffle to me and the chicken was pretty tender but pretty bland.  The grits were also fairly bland (although they ended up being my fave part of this meal.)  Portions are generous - I certainly couldn't finish it!

The fella was super impressed by the awesomeness of the bacon & corned beef has which I also thought was super yummy.  The pork seemed a bit dry to me although it was done to the ""medium"" specs requested. 

I'm definitely going to give this place more business as it seems consistently good but I guess I was looking for them to wow my taste-buds.  There are certainly better spots in Kent if you are looking for a REALLY spectacular meal but Bricco does have the ""trendy"" factor going for it.  (And a great rotating specialty beer list, though nothing on tap.)",Restaurant

I came with a pal and his 3-year old daughter. Clearly, this isn't a super child-friendly place, but everyone - our waitress, the other waiters and waitresses, the hostesses, and the kitchen staff - did everything within their power to accommodate the wee one...including making a chocolate milk from scratch.  Ridiculous, and it got applause from the kiddo!

Being at the pre-opening, we had the opportunity to try a lot of different things...like a gross amount of food.  I'm not exactly proud of how much I ate.

We started with the crusty bread and oil, prosciutto (a HUGE pile), another pork meat I can't recall, manchego and prairie breeze cheeses.  While eating them, I wondered why our server didn't tell us which meat was which...and then we noticed they are actually written on the plate paper liner.  Duh....

I had the ""healthy"" salmon entree, which was cooked to perfection and the farro, cooked apple and fennel side flavorful enough that I wouldn't immediate think it was super healthy.   My buddy wanted the Korean Ribeye Cap but it was not available (noted on the menu that it has extremely limited availability), so he got the pork ribs instead.  It was a TON of food again, with a side of cole slaw that I ate.  For kids, we were given the option of grilled cheese sliders, burger sliders, mac n cheese, and chicken tenders, so slightly more options than I'd expect for a not-so-kid-friendly type of place.

My pal had the Bacon Bloody Mary and guzzled 2 of those.  I had only 1 cocktail - the Maria Pepino, which is basically a bloody mary with tequila instead of vodka, and garnished with a pickled pepper.  It was the perfect blend of savory tomato, spice, and acid.

The only ""misses"" for me was the iced tea (no one has plain iced tea anymore...no biggie, but please freaking tell me it's some nasty sweet shit) and the monkey bread, which was overly sweet and had a ton of apples that we picked around.

Our bill was an astronomical $110+ for lunch...which included 3 cocktails, a few appetizers, 3 entrees, and a dessert.  Would I be back for the whole she-bang?  Hell no...unless it's another gratis meal.  But will I be back for the sweet patio and a great cocktail and apps?  Most definitely!

FYI, the large patio space is deceiving...it is actually shared with the coffee shop and oyster bar (not yet open as far as I know), so I cannot imagine there will ever be a time without a large wait for group patio seating.

Lots of parking in the back.  Clean restrooms, but odd how they're set up... They are outside of the main restaurant portion, with separate doors for Men and Women.  But both doors take you to the communal sinks.  Why not just have one door to the restrooms?

kgAb-RzZoBzx9QZgRVJZQg,135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A,XxmziAeRqMKwsDjyyjVgeg,2015-09-29,"I came here with my parents this past Fri. evening at around 6pm.  I live a few blocks away and Zarra's was one of the closest places I had bookmarked.  Given that my mom is a picky eater and enjoys casual Italian eateries, and that my parents were staying in Oakland (not at the hotel across the street, FWIW), I figured it was as good of a reason as any to check it out. Zarra's is most definitely an old school red sauce joint, so it fits the bill for Pittsburgh Italian comfort food--don't come here if you're expecting trendy, cutting-edge fare.

For our entrees, my mom had the meatless lasagna ($16), my dad has the Zarra's sampler ($22), and I had the ricotta noodles ($18).  All of the entrees came with side salads, as well as a shared bread plate.  The bread was insubstantial and mediocre, and came with an oil dipping sauce, which is a good thing, since it wouldn't have held up to butter.  The salads were along the same lines, consisting of spinach dressed with a vinaigrette sauce and a few vegetables that most likely came out of a can.  You can get blue cheese on your salad, which my mom and I did, or anchovies, as my dad did, but just be aware that these additions come at an upcharge.

Fortunately, the entrees were better.  The manicotti had an interesting pointy shape and light texture that was different than any I've eaten before.  Flavorwise, they weren't too exciting, which was also true for the red sauce.  Each entree came with a side of sausage, meatball, or eggplant, so I chose the latter for mine since I'm inherently leery of ground meat.  The eggplant added some variety to the dish, but I found it a bit on the mushy side.  My mom and dad enjoyed their entrees--my mom is picky about the composition of lasagna, so I was happy to see that she ate it without picking it apart.  I tried a bite of it, and it was pretty similar to the lasagna she makes at home, which is probably why.  I didn't try any of the other items, so I can't directly comment on them except to say that the meatballs are huge (about 3"" in diameter and twice the size of meatballs I've had at the meatball joint downtown).  I wanted to try the baked Alaska since I'd never had one, but my parents were too full to share it with me, and I didn't want to get stuck eating the whole thing, so we ended up passing on it.

Overall, we were generally satisfied with our meal at Zarra's, despite the lackluster start to the meal.  The fare was exactly what I expected, satisfying my mom's pickiness and filling us all up after a long day of travel or work.  The service was excellent, as was proper given that we were about the only ones in the restaurant other than a few people sitting on the porch by the time we left.  As others have mentioned, the decor--right down to the toilet seat in the women's restroom--is interesting and eclectic, and makes for good conversation.  While I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back sometime--perhaps to try the baked Alaska--given its convenience to my apt.  3.5 stars.",Restaurant

The restaurant is located in one of the parking lot in Colossus, close to Costco and near Urban Barn and although it's a new building, it feels as though its been there for ages. Outside is a patio ringed with gas lanterns and one of the largest outdoor gas fire pits that I've ever seen. Just outside the main door is a metal bull...who seems to have become a hit with budding photographers, as there was a queue of people waiting to have their picture taken on him, when we arrived. Unfortunately for us, we had a shot of his backside while dining....but thankfully the artist wasn't ""detailed"" in his artwork.
The restaurant décor is typical steakhouse fare. I liked the idea that they repurposed glass decanters as hanging lights...very neat idea....adding some ambiance to an already warm restaurant.
We were fortunate to have a young buck by the name of Anthony as our waiter. He was fantastic. He was everything a waiter should be....warm, friendly, attentive, offering recommendations\/suggestions, entertaining and he seemed to take great pride in the menu\/restaurant. He was stellar ! 
I ordered the Teriyaki Steak, with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and seasonal vegetables (beets and asparagus). The veggies made our table cringe, as no one was a beet fan, but Anthony assured us that we would like them and he was bang-on. They were grilled and if not for the colour, you'd have no idea they were beets. My steak was cooked perfectly...medium rare to medium, mashed potatoes were a tad on the dry side, but still fantastic...no hint of wasabi though. The steak itself was moist with nary a hint of gristle. As we had what's called ""the Chop Experience"", it came with a side salad or soup.....I opted for the Caesar salad. It was nice and garlicky....but lacked bacon...odd for a Caesar salad at a steakhouse. 
3 people at our table ordered the steak with lobster topper (gorgonzola cheese mixed with lobster) resting ""on top"" of the steak.  They loved it!  Anthony assured those who ordered it that the gorgonzola didn't overwhelm the lobster flavour and once again, he was correct. All 3 people who ordered this dish opted for a loaded baked potato as their carb...and wow was it massive. 
After dinner (and as an added bonus), Anthony brought out a mini raspberry creme brûlée for the birthday girl at our table. It was cooked in an espresso cup, with happy birthday written on the plate it sat on. I don't know if it was good (as I wasn't offered any by the birthday girl), but she woofed it down pretty damn fast.
So, in summary......warm environment, amazing service, fantastic steak, reasonably priced wine list, interesting dessert menu (both liquid and food wise), convenient location and reasonable priced.
Dinner for 6 with a bottle of wine came to just over $300. I usually tip 15% but due to the fantastic service, decided to pump it to 20%. 
I highly recommend this place.",Restaurant

 I just ordered what cost me (with tip) about $50 for delivery.  Terrible experience.  Nothing was right in 6 items!  

     But here is the main reason that I am so disturbed about my experience with this restaurant:  THE CARROTS IN MY DISHES WERE NOT CLEANED!  Instead of peeling off the dirty skin of the carrots to clean them, they include the dirty skin, stir fry it and serve it to you it in the meal!  My dishes had all kinds of odd pieces of carrots with the dirty skin still on.  I took a mouth full of the first dish and it tasted like garbage!  Like dirt! Literally!  There is no way that they even washed the carrots!  

     In the next dish, the string beans were not cleaned!  They did not have the string removed so it was impossible to eat them.  My zucchini and other veggies were undercooked and tasted rotten and raw!  Other dishes were soggy, oily, wrongly seasoned, tasteless and just plain bad.  Even the white rice was dry and hard to chew.  The Hot & Sour soup has no traditional ingredients in it that makes it a hot and sour soup.  It just had a few pieces of beef in it and small broken mushrooms.  Everything was either raw tasting, or tasteless or tasted like garbage, because it actually was.  The dirty skin of vegetables are to be discarded, not to fed to a guy who just made a $50 order.

     So, the nice guy that I am, I just figured I should give them a break and not to write a negative review on Yelp for them.  This is only my 5th Yelp review ever and two of them are extremely positive!  So I called them and tried to talk to the younger lady Margaret who spoke clear English and to make my complaints to her.  The older lady who is the owner, treated me like I am an idiot and kept telling me that she was Margaret!  So I started telling her how dissatisfied I was about the food.  Then she rudely started talking Chinese to someone else in the background in the middle of my complaining.  She was not listening!  I finally got her to get the younger lady back on the phone.  I told her all about my complaints and said that if I was not sick, I would have come back with the food and asked for a refund.  

     Now, here is why I am writing all this when I did not intend to make a negative yelp review:  When I told the young lady, Margaret all of my complaints, she said:  ""YEAH, I KNOW!  I TELL THEM ALL THE TIME OF THESE COMPLAINTS BUT NOTHING CHANGES!""   She basically said that she can not really tell them anymore, cause ""he is the boss and I do not want to get fired""!   Wow!  She did not want to tell the boss, which turned out to be her uncle of the complaints anymore so that she can keep her job.  People are calling all the time and complaining and these people are still ripping people off and endangering the public's health with garbage food!  

     I just see so clearly that they are comfortable sending garbage out to delivery orders because there is a less of a chance that the guy will drive all the way back to the restaurant to ask for his money back.  But this food can make people sick.  I do not know if I will not be sick tomorrow for the little of the nasty food that I ate today.  If I was not sick and unable to leave the house I would have gone over there right now and give them back the garbage and not left without my money.  I threw the rest of the so called food away as I did not trust any of it anymore.  I am already sick and recovering from a surgery and do not want to add food poisoning to the list of my current issues.  

   And they are also fraudulent as they engage in false advertising on top of everything.  The flyer says you get a free order of walnut shrimp with a $35 order.  When you get your order, what you get is not an order of walnut shrimp, but a HALF ORDER, which comes in one of those small containers that fits a McDonald's burger!  

     If they are cheating and short-changing the customer at every chance, I wonder how their refrigerators looks like.  There is no way these people are throwing away any rotting old ingredients.  They are probably just tossing them into the wok and feeding them to the people, and I believe I was one such victim today.   The internal culture of this place is obvious at every turn and I am just in a state of disbelief that they are in business.

     For the first time ever, I do not feel that complaining to the restaurant or making a Yelp complaint is enough.  I am going to call the Health Department and file an official complaint.  Something needs to be done and someone needs to take the initiative or these people are going to be ripping people off and serving them garbage for a long time to come.  When will they be stopped?  When someone gets food poisoning?  When someone gets hospitalized?  

     I feel a duty to make the Health Department aware of the situation.  As far as you are concerned, you have been warned.  Stay away!",Restaurant

Honestly, I've only been to Kona Grill for their Happy Hour.  Yes.  I'm such a cheapie!  I've not been overly interested in their regular menu because I dunno, for ok looking Pacific Rim cuisine it just looks OK to me.  Just seems a tad overpriced.  But I do understand it's Summerlin so the markup needs to be present!

Seems lots of folks like Kona Grill for Happy Hour!  I think it runs M-F from 3 PM to 7 PM, and also most nights from 10 PM to close.  Keep in mind though the weather, Happy Hour is only available at the bar or the outside patio!  If it's too hot or too cold you're in for a not so happy hour.  Also, bar and outside patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis...don't expect a host or hostess to seat you!  Don't wait, find an open table and sit your fat @$$ down!  It can get super busy.

Happy Hour at Kona Grill has a nice menu selection of food and drinks.  It will definitely keep you snackin' and and conversatin'!  Just go with a few friends and you will be kept occupied for a few hours.  Eat and be merry!  Work on your game!  Trust me...some of you 'mackers' need some practice on your form.  Really, ""Come here often?"" is a pickup line?  Oi.  I may not be the best lookin' guy out there but dammit if I'm anything, I'm overconfident (thanks wifey for putting up with me).  Go out there and project you deserve a hot gal on your arm!  Girl with fake boobs and botox lips says ""NO"", just move on!  There's like a dozen of em' at the bar.  Can't score if you don't play the game!  Start shootin'!

Anyway, back to Happy Hour.  There's a lot to try from their menu.  Some of our faves are:

-Sweet & Spicy Shrimp
-Chicken Satay
-Kona Calamari
-Chicken & Shrimp Lettuce Wraps
-Cheeseburger Sliders
-BBQ Chicken Flatbread (kinda like a pizza)
-Crab Crunch Roll
-Atlantic Roll

Of course on Happy Hour, all this food is 1\/2 price!  Stock up and feed your friends!  Most things will average to between $4-$6 each item.  Save some money!

The drinks are decent prices during Kona Grill's Happy Hour too.  You can get a Sam Adams for $4, margaritas and cosmos for $5 each, wine selection of the day for $5, or a Bud Light draft for $3.50.  There's a few other specials as well.  Not only can you get fed, but get drunk on the cheap as well!

Reason why my rating might seem a bit low?  Damn, sometimes the quality of the food at Happy Hour isn't the greatest.  It just ends up tasting OK.  Of course for the price you pay you won't get your taste buds knocked off, but I've been to better Happy Hour shindigs.  Hello...Yard House, anyone??  Sometimes the food at Kona Grill can be hit or miss.  Plus, I knocked off a 1\/2 star because who the HELL wants to sit out in the patio area when it's like 105 degrees and you're sweating like a baboon?  The fact that the water misters weren't working properly that day ticked me off as well.  Kinda ruins the experience just a little bit.

Service was OK, slow but I can understand somewhat because just about every table in the patio area was full.  And orders were steadily going into the kitchen at a nice rate.  At least our server was nice, and tried their best to keep our water filled since it really was hot outside.  

Will I be back?  Sure, but there are so many other places to get your Happy Hour on at!  Kona Grill won't be the top of my list every time but it is a contender.  I hear right down the way at The Cheesecake Factory they have a Happy Hour of their own as well.  I'm pretty sure so does the Gordon Biersch right next door!

I am very unhappy. I was very confident that going through this company was going to be a great choice for my wedding day after having serious issues with my previous makeup vendor. Megan assured me that things would go very smoothly and that I would be happy and taken care of, and that as the first vendors of the day they would be setting the tone for my wedding day. Sadly, this was not the case. 

For my makeup trial- my artist Celina showed up late, which would not have been a big deal as I try to be very flexible, but when she arrived she complained about her previous appointment and the lighting in my hotel room- which I agree was not the best, but not something I have control over either. I showed her photos of my inspiration for my makeup and she got started. She did not stop or ask me step by step how I liked what she was doing or if I would change things- she did my makeup, said I was done and told me to go look in a mirror. My foundation was blotchy and so uneven that I actually took it off before going out because I was embarrassed. My makeup didn't look anything like what I asked for. I have eyelash extensions as well and she got so much foundation on my lashes that I looked laughable, so when I told her, she put eye shadow over them and also got it all over my face which she said she ""wouldn't do tomorrow"" I should have known that the next day would not be different, but I thought that the trial at least showed me what I knew I didn't like and what to mention the next day.

On my wedding day the two teams she sent got started right on time, the one makeup artist (NOT the one who did my trial) was very friendly and did my mother and one of my bridesmaids makeup. She took her time and they looked wonderful. However, the girl who did the rest of my party's makeup (Celina) seemed like she was in a hurry as soon as she arrived and had an attitude with everyone she interacted with (even other members of the team) She did our makeup so poorly that nearly everyone felt the need to ""fix"" theirs, and when anyone mentioned that they didn't like something she actually argued with them rather than offering to correct it. Which, I felt was beyond unprofessional. She also huffed and pouted and argued with me when I asked about having my tattoo covered- which was supposed to be included in what I paid. She scolded me like a child and told me that I should have told her that the day before and now I was out of luck. Another thing I would like to point out is how all she kept telling us was that she didn't have enough time to do anything and rushed all of us but she had time to text and play on her phone, and later mentioned she was going to go walk her dog for an hour. When I hinted that I was unhappy she said that she did not have time to fix anything because she had other brides, and bookings back to back, and it ""wouldn't be right to make those brides wait"". I find it offensive that as a bride, my feelings and the money I paid did not seem to matter at all. 

 I also made it a big point, and emailing Megan several times, to say that we did not need to be ready until 11am. I did not want to have to sit around for hours trying not to mess up my makeup. Celina was in such a hurry to leave that she was packed and out the door by 8:30am. My mom tried to stop her and ask where she was going because she left without airbrushing our neck or chest area (which according to Megan she was supposed to do, and why we wore shirts with specific necklines- which Megan told us to do in her emails) and she just ignored her and walked out. My party's hair was also not done in the best manner. One of my bridesmaids who asked simply for curls had chunks of hair that were untouched and later had to re-curl her whole head. Anyone who did not get an up-do had their hair falling by the time the ceremony started.

The one hair stylist who stayed with me until 9am contacted Megan to let her know how upset I was (honestly I  looked so bad that I was in tears) and to see if another artist had time to fix my face before the wedding ceremony- but instead of trying to make it right or help me on the biggest day of my life, she offered to refund my deposit and said to ""go out to dinner"" on her. This was my wedding day- not prom. I don't get a do-over or a second chance for this. Luckily, my MOH were kind enough to rise to the challenge and fixed as much of my makeup as she could before my ceremony. I have never been so unhappy with a service in my whole life. Considering everything that I went through on the most important day of my life, being treated like I didn't matter by Megan's staff, I would pass on this company. In the end I requested, and received my money back. To me that will never justify their behavior and how we were all treated or make it any better. Skip this one ladies.",Beauty
DyEI3DuIp9v8HEc6hP8gCQ,RlHbVsMa-T-OWPirAkhcAA,sXE35M-6Tm-S1fe8_N-DeA,2015-03-19,"I have never experienced anything like what I suffered through with this salon. When you first go, everyone is nice and the place looks very professional and it is designed well - but don't be fooled like I was, it is all superficial. I asked for ash brown hair.. My hair was healthy and hadn't been died in 10 months because I am from Toronto originally and have an incredible salon that I usually go to there.. However I was desperate for a hair dye and didn't have time to fly to Toronto so I went here based on the few good reviews that I read. This is your typical posh salon where the stylists have quite the conceded posh attitude, they seem to be ""fake nice"", especially since one stylist was smiling at another client while whispering how annoyed he was with her - but honestly I was happy to put up with the crappy attitude of the stylists so long as they did my hair properly. I very specifically told the owner\/head colorist that my hair could not take more than 10volume as my hair lightens too quickly with the typical 20volume peroxide.. He seemed to understand however at the end of the treatment I noticed my hair was brassy and too warm and too light, I asked if he had used 10volume and he said ""no I used 20volume"" he said he would fix it so I went back and he only made my hair a darker really ugly colour and he told me to go home and see how I feel after a few days - everyone who saw it told me that it looked like a cheap out of the box gray-coverage dye... For $250 this was unacceptable. I tried calling but he ""he was busy"" and receptionists are all very nice and I think they know that the owner is rude and crazy, but they kept passing along my messages and I got no phone call back, after a couple weeks I decided to finally go to the salon and try to speak with the owner (I had already booked a flight to Toronto and my regular stylist said that she will try to work her magic and make me beautiful again, but I still have to wait 2 more weeks with this terrible colour), when I arrived i politely waited until the owner\/colourist came to talk to me.. And before I could even open my mouth he was screaming at me and had his finger in my face.. It was so bad that I had to film him (the phone was beside my face and the camera could see only up his nose, that's how close he was to my face screaming at me that he will not fix my hair and not give me money back - keep in mind that I hadn't even yet mentioned that I wanted money back.. I hadn't said anything other than ""hello, thank you for finding time to speak with me"" lol!) anyway, I asked if he could please step back and let me speak and he refused and he said he was calling the police lol at this point I thought that maybe he was on drugs or something because he was acting like more of a lunatic than what you would expect from a business owner\/service provider.. Still without allowing me to say a word, he began saying that I could take him to court if I want but he will do nothing for me - he even continued to say that I was harassing his receptionists by calling the salon 5 times in the past 3 weeks... I think I was just in shock at the whole thing because I was just sitting there waiting for him to stop yelling and I couldn't even think of what to do because this was not something I've ever seen or expected.. He ended up rambling something about my Facebook photos.. Which makes me feel uncomfortable because I didn't give them my Facebook profile which means that he probably sat there like a 14 year old girl creeping and stalking my Facebook.. Just extra weirdness to add to this whole thing.

So enough of my detailed rambling, but I just want everyone to get an idea of how ridiculous this place is and how bad it was so that they never have to find themselves in that situation. And the best part - just to give a final idea of how amazingly looney this guy is, after the police got there and I told them what happened they advised me to take him to small claims court and file a complaint with the consumer protection bureau.. And the receptionist quietly apologized to me on the way out as though she was afraid of the crazy owner.

Also, I didn't even complain about it because it's not a big deal, but the other guy had cut my hair unevenly lol so I'm not sure if all of the stylists are even properly trained\/licensed. 

Bottom line: insanely rude stylists, lack of skill, poor client relations, lack of common decency. I don't understand how they have any good reviews at all, maybe these people are easily charmed or have gotten lucky, but if you are picky with your hair and have high standards, find another place to go.",Beauty
BVJpRKv-PwFGVdhp44qQug,YQPDBJKKFFseQybsvo2rog,pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,2010-02-05,"I'm somewhat new to Arizona, so when relatives from out of town said they had heard of this place on the Food Network and knew what they needed to do to get in, I figured why not?

We get off work and head over to meet them at 5:00, when the place opens. There is a small valet lot (full) and a public parking garage ($12.00) which the restaurant will validate (only $9.00, though, you still have to cough up $3.00). Our dinner companions already had a table inside which was great because there was a huge crowd outside. Inside, the restaurant is teeny-tiny, with maybe six tables that seat four or more, a few tables that seat two, and a bar area where people can eat. The bathrooms are one-at-a-time only and the ladies' toilet did not flush properly. 

I scanned the menu and quickly realized that they serve pizza and some salads - that's it. So if you have any dietary restrictions you're pretty much f*cked. While we are waiting for our food to arrive my dining companions inform me that they showed up at 3:00 to secure a table. THREE?!??! and they WEREN'T the first in line either! WHAT? 

Bread comes and it is homemade and delicious, with a crispy-outside, spongy-inside thing going on, and the inside was the best - soft and delicious with huge swiss-cheese-like bubbles (don't know how else to so eloquently put it). Then drink refills come. No one else is being served (so they fire up these orders TO order, not bad, okay). I didn't have salad but they looked pretty good - buffalo mozarella and fresh basil, huge slices of tomato for the caprese. Kalamatas on the baby greens salad. 

Pizza comes out, finally! $12 each for personal-sized pizzas with thin crust. The four-cheese was great; you can really taste the separate flavors of the cheeses. Arugula on top. A couple of the pizzas had salami or sausage on them. Too salty (and I LOVE salt so yeah, that's saying a lot if even I am critical on that point). One pizza's crust was not burned but charred black on half of it. But it's food so it can't be perfect every time now can it. 

A table of two finished\/paid\/left. They were the first people to finish from the first wave of customers and it was after 6:00 pm when this happened, and there was still a shitload of people outside. Meaning that if you don't line up at 3:00 to get in at 5:00, the soonest you can be seated is after 6:00 (and that's likely if you showed up between 3:30 and 4:00 for a table). 

Here's where it gets tricky - we paid, but were finishing our drinks. We were NOT the only ones there taking up a first-wave table who hadn't left yet. And after paying $150 for PIZZA (give me a break, please) the hostess came over and asked us to clear out because ""people waiting outside are getting upset."" Hey, I can see how that sucks for them but we're customers too and so is everyone else around us who have been lounging around for this long. When we exited the restaurant the people waiting outside were giving us (and everyone else who was leaving) DIRTY looks. Bitch please - it was YOUR decision to come here and wait in this ridiculous line, for one. For two - the food isn't that great anyway. Would I ever come here again? Hell no would I ever wait in a line that long for ANYTHING, not even if they sprinkled diamonds on the overly-salty meats. Oh, and I woke up twice in the middle of the night feeling like my face was caving in on itself and had to get up to go drink water.",Restaurant

First of all our server, Anthony, was AWESOME.  He was friendly and energetic but definitely not aggressive or over the top.  He was fantastic about explaining everything on the menu and answering our questions, and he was excellent about making suggestions, especially when we were on the fence about some things.

We started out with Ty Nant sparkling spring water which was very good!  JAS likes beer with his steak, so he ordered the Moose Drool Brown Ale and thought it was great.  I asked if they had pineapple juice, which they did, but even better was that it was freshly squeezed!  Delicious.

JAS and I had reviewed the menu online earlier in the day and decided that we were going to get the Roasted Beef Wellington for two.  We had watched enough Hell's Kitchen to make us want to try this famous dish.  We had mentioned this to Anthony prior to him bringing over the steak display which, by the way, was pretty impressive:
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=BVZECZd6-u3Zw45DfVKEtw#BVZECZd6-u3Zw45DfVKEtw

Anthony said he would still go over the steaks with us, and we were glad he did.  JAS loves ribeyes, and when Anthony described the rib cap to us, he threw a wrench in our plans.  Ohhhh, what should we do?  He then said that he could have the kitchen split the orders into two plates if we wanted so we could try both.  What a fantastic idea!  So out went the Beef Wellington for two, in came the Beef Wellington for one AND the Kobe American Rib Cap.

I wish I had a better memory because they served different kinds of bread with butter (did I hear Devonshire?) and volcanic sea salt.  Yummy.
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=_UfQDFOJOaDyfUWiMOq08g#_UfQDFOJOaDyfUWiMOq08g

We started with the Heirloom Tomato Salad with red bell pepper vinaigrette, cucumber cauliflower puree, spiced marcona almonds.  They split it into two plates for us.  So fresh, so delicious.  I wanted to lick everything off that plate.  (I didn't!)  
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=DhEwPJGDDfUy6huMrmYOLA#DhEwPJGDDfUy6huMrmYOLA

The Roasted Beef Wellington was served with glazed root vegetables, potato puree, and red wine demi glace.  This was no ordinary Beef Wellington.  Anthony had described what the steak was wrapped in but there were so many components that I can't remember it all!   It was split into two plates and it tasted wonderful!

zf_AsNuDDDqwKf3fFV-ERw,p9tMxZ9dczj1qWdljVJBUw,KTzleyVkocM474dA-o-ovA,2014-03-20,"I had one of the worst experiences going to this salon with my friend today than I have ever had anywhere in this city. Sadly it has little to do with the estheticians and to do with their customer service. But nonetheless, here goes nothing:

Issue #1: One of the first rules of a shellac manicure is that it MUST be a ""dry manicure"". This just means that your nails will not be soaked in warm water as with a regular manicure and that the massage cream and cuticle oil will be applied at the end after the shellac has been applied. A dry manicure is essential, because the nails need to be completely dry to ensure better adhesion of the polish, as well as longer wear. This was not done and when I informed the woman working on my nails of this, she protested and forced my hand into the bowl of water. She said that there was no way to do proper cuticle work without first soaking the nails. When I insisted that this would drastically reduce the longevity of the manicure and told her to use the cuticle softener if it was a huge issue instead, she started to tell me my cuticles were in terrible shape and I must have been terrible at doing my own nails. I just shut up at this point because I was pretty angry already with her tone. 

Issue #2: When asked how I wanted my nails shaped I said to ""just clean them up, I like the natural shape of them"". She asked me if I wanted them square and I said No. When I looked at my nails, they were oval and lopsided. I'm pretty picky with my nail shape so I usually have to correct the esthetician's work wherever I go but they don't ever get huffy with me. This woman did and started to tell me I didn't know what shape I wanted when a woman behind me spoke up and said ""actually she did tell you to keep the shape they were already, I heard her"". I don't think the woman liked this at all. 

Issue #3: In the end, my nails do look really lovely. I can see that I will have to let them grow in for a while to get the shape back that I like, but that can be resolved. However, there are air bubbles in the shellac which come from not allowing the layers to dry sufficiently before the next is applied. This will affect the longevity of the shellac, not to mention it's driving my OCD up a wall!!!

The biggest issue I have with this nail salon came at the end of my experience. As I said, I was there with a friend of mine and her manicure was finishing up a few minutes after mine. There was a woman who came in who is on a first name basis with the manager and clearly a regular. She sat down to get her nails done and the manager (who is also the woman who worked on my nails) sat down to do them. They began talking and I could overhear their conversation. The manager was rudely discussing my issues with the nail shape and with putting my nails in the bowl! Not only that, but she actually had the audacity to turn around and point at me and say ""that girl, right there"" as if I wasn't looking her right in the face! 

Livid, I walked up to my friend to see how long she had left before she could leave. There was a woman at the chair in front of her that was discussing the sign out front that reads ""Shellac Manicure $15"" (Note: It does not say ""Shellac $15"" which would indicated just the polish, but it clearly states that it is a manicure. This sign is the reason we came in. The two ladies in front of my friend were arguing the price and considering going else where. When I spoke up and asked why we were going to be charged $30 instead of the advertised $15, the manager yelled at me to ""butt out"" as she was ""not even talking to me"". She then began to raise her voice at the now four of us who were inquiring about the price discrepancy. She said that the sign was from a long time ago and that the price is what she says it is. 

My friend and I tried to continue to argue but things were getting too heated to continue. We paid our $33.90 (taxes extra because we didn't pay with cash) and left. I took a picture of the sign which I will be posting and kept a copy of my receipt. 

I have contacted the Better Business Bureau and the Competition Bureau of Canada and notified them of this false advertising issue. Normally I wouldn't put up this big of a stink with a nail salon, they are a dime a dozen in this area. However that is exactly why I decided to do this. With so many nail salons in Koreatown on Bloor West, the deciding factor is often price or reputation; most often it is price. If this salon is luring their customers off the street with the promise of a cheap shellac manicure, then they are taking away business and falsely advertising to customers who might have gone elsewhere. Just down the street there is a salon called ""4 U Nails"" which advertises clearly $15 for shellac and $23 for shellac manicure. I would have gone there instead had I known what I nightmare the customer service and price issues were going to be.",Beauty
OtG9uI8uD8iysS2b8HiQnQ,EJ7ZhRHsMWj8du77LX34gw,_zuXI7bwe73jcA_8S3Zq6w,2014-10-29,"This space offers a number of beauty services. My introduction was wonderful. I rave and rave (and rave!) about the brazilian waxes offered by Le Studio De L'Adjege's owner, Nadjege. Her aesthetician skills are remarkable. Not a single in-grown hair. The process is as painless as it can be with incredibly affordable pricing. Both women and men can visit and feel comfortable in her care. The space is being ramped up with art continually being brought in. The walls have been painted with murals and framed art is on the walls.

Recently the space has expanded to offer nail and hair services. (Please note that each business is independently owned and operated.) Two sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, are offering manicures and pedis. Additionally they will spoil you with express facials. These differ from the luxury treatments Nadjege provides. If you need to get in\/out quickly an express facial is one way to go.

Haircuts, color and brazilian treatments are available with Samuel. Samuel hails from Toni & Guy. I'm not the best person to provide feedback on haircuts and color. My results were ... surprising. While visiting Nadjege Samuel introduced himself and sold me on his services. My bangs were freshly trimmed, however my roots needed to be filled in and I could not do this at home. (I had some ombre action going on. Past tense as my hair is gone. Samuel tried to fix the parts he fried with more cutting. That failed. I asked for my money back...and that still hasn't happened.)

My experience was unfortunate. Although we discussed introducing some ""movement"" into my hairstyle I was not prepared for the sharp layers that were chopped. When told my hair looked ""orange"" I shrugged, nodded and asked if we could make the tips lighter. Samuel explained there was some risk with ""bleaching color out"". Unfortunately the severity of risk was not outlined.

If Samuel didn't think he could go lighter he should have said so. The epic disaster that is my hair had me sucking chocolate this week. I look like a mid-western Mom that stuck her finger in an electric socket. It's not a cute look.

A timer was not set while my color was bleached out. A timer was not set while my roots were done. (My roots are currently brown, with grey showing.) Samuel left during the first process to purchase a bleaching shampoo. ""It was less damaging."" No. Apparently, no.

Having no expertise in the area of hair care - I did not go to beauty school - I relaxed into my chair. I put a brave face on as my hair was blown out and flat ironed. I had places to be. For some inexplicable reason my bangs were touched. They did not need to be touched. Again, they had recently been trimmed. Samuel made some unflattering comments about the previous stylist. (Why do that?) My bangs had been cut to respect a cowlick. Longer on one side. Now I look like a grammar school kid. (See photos.)

At home I was unable to comb the bottom of my hair. I returned asking for the bottom to be cut off. We clearly discussed using fingers to show how much was coming off. I got nervous as more cutting was happening. I asked what ""style"" he was doing. Samuel said he was keeping it long as he knew I liked it that way.

When the cutting was over I just sat there. I left. I sat in my car. I called my mom. It was really bad. It's really bad. The owner of the space tried to negotiate something to fix. (To have another color technician help. To have Samuel put a bob in.) 

But honestly, there is so little hair left. The margin for error is small. I don't like to write these kind of reviews. I wasn't going to. But here's the thing. The money has not cleared yet. (I spoke to the owner Friday. My bank should have seen something on Visa's side, even if it hadn't cleared yet.)

This ""thing"" has sucked up time. Going\/coming\/sitting there. Calling my bank numerous times. And I feel stupidly ugly walking around this. This has been traumatic. 

Don't forget - I still need to pay someone else to fix it.

I'm unclear of the actual hair studio name. My Square payment reads ""Puzzles Studio"".

Update: Just to close this out after reading the comment below. I was contacted regarding the refund only after this review was posted. Thank you for following up. Also thank you Nadjege for taking ownership of the hair salon's issue.",Beauty

CLUELESS, UNPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE REPAIRING A TRUCK MOUNT

A horrible experience dealing with a business that promised the world. I brought my machine in for service I asked if there was anything I needed to do or get them and they said no ""RELAX WE HAVE IT ALL TAKEN CARE OF.""  I asked for an idea when they would start working on it because I had customers waiting on me and I needed this piece of equipment, they said they would start on it and hopefully be done by Friday it was Tuesday at this point.

I told them if they needed any parts to expedite them overnight.  I called 2 days later and there mechanic was sick. When I called on Monday he was finishing up the small work load he was behind on from being sick and 1st thing Tuesday he would be working on it.  I waited to after lunch to call to see how his progress was.  He wasn't in the building they sent him to the Columbia Store because they had to install 3 brand new truck mounts and were behind.

I was dealing with AMY the store manager and she wasn't even sympathetic to the situation rather rude and said he would be back on Thursday and he would start on it then. I called Thursday and they said they needed a part they were waiting on come to find out there was no part they needed because the machine had not been moved from the spot I left it.  So Friday comes around I called after lunch and the mechanic was just starting on it.  One of the issues was it was leaking gas from the seal on the tank.  

""THIS WAS MADE VERY CLEAR TO THEM BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE A LIST OF THE REPAIRS TO BE PERFORMED, THE LIST THEY MADE WHILE I WAS THERE WAS SOME HOW LOST????""

I then got a call from them saying they couldn't work on it because all the gas drained out.  They knew that was one of the problems.  The worst part is they said I needed to bring in a gallon of gas there shop with traffic was an hour away.  I told them I would pay them to use there gas but they didn't have any.  

That was it I jumped in my truck brought a gallon of gas.  Then they couldn't get it started.  I have it on a trailer and it was on an angle.  It was now 3pm they close at 5 and unwilling to do anything to help me out.  They said we can start working on it again on Monday.  That was the last stray and they wanted to charge me $275.00 for changing the 1qt of engine oil, pump oil, and blower fluid.  

I spent over 30 hours on the phone I spent 2 hours to drive them 1 gallon of gas.  I know they have gas how would they start there new truck mount installs.  I lost the faith and business of 10 customers.  Then they tried to say they dont work on brands they dont sell.  In person they told me they worked on everything.

I was lied to, manipulated and there area supervisor finally agreed not to charge me the hrs worth of labor and less the $20 in fluids they used.  When I got home the 1st thing I checked was the oil level

""ITS A HONDA GX390 THEY OVERFILLED CAUSING THE SAFETY SWITCH TO KILL THE IGNITION, HAVING IT ON AN ANGLE MADE IT WORSE""

ANYONE THINKING OF SPENDING MONEY THERE DONT LITTLE DID THEY KNOW I RECORDED THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION THE RUDENESS ECT.........I A MORE THEN HAPPY TO SHARE IT WITH ANYONE.  The only chemicals they want to sell is there own lin ""NEWLINE""  they stock all most of the shelves with it and keep everything else such as:
Bridgepoint
Viper
Prochem
ECT
PROS cHOICE

They dont carry any buffers, bonnets, or regular consumables the only reason there in business in my opinion is they have a huge customer base, and there the only Carpet Cleaning and Supply Store in Town.  they treat you like a king until there is any sort of problem or a sticky situation. 

IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE AND DON'T CARE ABOUT FOLLOW UP THERE THE STORE FOR YOU.  If you really need service work done make the 4 hr drive to Norcross and you have you choice from about 6 different stores that work on a professional level.  I called ICS Truck Mounts they said if they new I was coming and either came the night before or left at 4am they would have a mechanic waiting for me when I pulled in.  I spent 4 hours just driving back and forth to Clean source.  I really hope this helps someone

Good Luck

I had to cut it not once, but three times to get the dead, fried ends that looked like long spider legs going in every direction! It looked horrible, completely frizzy and dried up. Even my hairstylist that cut my hair told me it's completely fried that's why it looks like that. I didn't feel good to pay top dollar for a shitty job that wasn't well done the second time around. He did, however get the color I wanted, but for me to go through that bs and ruin my healthy hair was quite a disappointment to experience. Even two of my coworkers went to him and had the same experience and we all no longer go there.

I found Amy Kiser from my eyelash extension girl and I liked her hair color. Mind you, she changes her hair color every 3 weeks. She told me great things about her, so I made an appointment to give her a try.

She has her own sense of style, idea, creation of color. She has this master plan already strategically made before I arrive in what we're doing to my hair. Be open to her suggestions and you can have some fabulous dimensions of color. 

Our first session was a miracle. She achieved a high contrast blonde! Even though my roots were black! Obscene, I know. I couldn't believe my eyes either!!!

Make sure you ask her to put your head out of the wash bowl when you're resting after putting some toner on. It was complete torture for the back of my neck, since it was hitting my pressure points so painfully. I felt like it was sucking all my energy source and completely drained the life out of me. I desperately tried to rest my head left and right, but it didn't do anything for me. My last session I told Amy.. it hurts like hell resting my head in this water bowl. She told me I can take my head out and she adjusted the water bowl. What a difference that made. Crucial to ask, because you're going to be there for a few hours!!! Beware ;)

What I love about Amy is simply this.. she genuinely cares about my hair condition. Olaplex is generously applied and my hair never felt so healthy and shiny! Soft as a feather.. EVERYTIME. My hair has grown without any struggle and it's strong! For a process of coloring to the extreme of ash blonde. It came out beautiful and a job well done.

I've had endless of compliments and inquiries on her work. I couldn't be more happier with the results of color and condition of my hair. It took three sessions to get the color I wanted to achieve without damaging my hair in the process. So be patient if the color you want is beyond lighter than your natural hair color! 

For the price she charges for all that she does.. I kick myself for going to someone that charged me double and then some! One of the best prices for hair coloring in town and her technique is flawless. She tells me why she put this in my hair and why she made this section darker, lighter, and so forth. Everything has a reason for her application. 

My third and last session I had with Amy. She gave my blonde some dimensions of high and low contrast. Making this illusion of dark to light then back to dark in sequence. I ended up loving it more than just being a ordinary blonde! And I didn't even tell her what I wanted. I let her do what she does best. Sometimes that's the way to go!

Easygoing, personable, loves to chat it up. She's spunky like full of spirit and ready to conquer this game of hair color wars. 

The salon, itself is located in the heart of Henderson. It's on S. Eastern Ave., between W. Horizon Ridge Pkwy. and Sunridge Heights Pkwy. Once you see Anthem Dental and Martial Arts sign, turn into that business complex. There's also a Village Pub in the same area! Clean, well-lit with sunshine, airy, open, spacious! Staff is friendly, helpful, and welcoming.

Thank you for taking great care of my hair and giving me some bombshell blonde colors! If you want to make some drastic new year, new look color.. look no further. Amy Kiser makes it happen. Healthy blonde dreams do come true ;)",Beauty
MhjcdWyYn76ul6X55HMdFw,FlDVQO-ySdrypmJjTPkY1Q,aqLR6oUVsBw6wzoEFYR5Bw,2017-06-01,"A couple months ago, I received a bad haircut from a low-cost salon, and after searching for a ""higher-end"" salon and reading good reviews on Yelp about Salon D'Shayn, I called them to see about getting it fixed. I was given an appointment with Nadine. 

I found the salon to be difficult to find (I've only lived here 6 months, so still learning my way around), and parking was positively AWFUL. The salon was cute and seemed comfortable. The staff that greeted me were friendly. Nadine came out and greeted me warmly; quite friendly at first, even offering me a glass of wine to relax with, which I very much appreciated and received gladly. However, after that, she really didn't talk to me much, but rather just hummed instead.

When I set the appointment, I told the girl on the phone why I was coming--that I'd received a poor haircut elsewhere and just needed some of the layers evened up. It was not a full haircut I was asking for, but rather just some trimming. When I met Nadine, I explained to her, as well, what I was there for. I explained that my hair had been all one length, and I'd decided to cut it to about shoulder length and just feather it back (think Farah Fawcett!)...I'd gone to a low-cost salon and the first girl gave me a terrible cut...I returned there to have it fixed, and a second girl fixed some, but it was still uneven, so I just wanted the layers evened up and to blend better, if possible. I told her I did NOT want any more length removed in the back, but rather to just even out and blend the layers that were already there. Nadine assured me that she understood what I wanted, and that she could do it.

I generally chit chat with a hairdresser to get to know them and to pass the time. Nadine really did not seem interested in talking with me, as her answers were usually short and general. Other than that, she just hummed. And conversed with other people, just not so much me. When I asked her how long she'd been styling hair, she just replied, ""Long enough to know I like doing it..."", which was kind of flippant--(that's not what I asked, I was interested in knowing if it had been several weeks or several years!), but whatever. 
And apparently, she did NOT understand what I wanted, because even though she spent TWO HOURS working on it, the layers are STILL not blended very well or necessarily even. The worst part is what she did to the back. I had specifically told her that I did NOT want any more length removed from the back, that instead I just wanted what layers were already there to be evened up a bit and blended better, IF POSSIBLE, (the previous stylist had cut 3 very large, choppy layers in the back). What Nadine did was thin my hair in the back BY ABOUT 50%! And no, the layers that were already there were NOT evened or blended better--she really just thinned the back out. I know for a fact she thinned it, because literally the day before, and the morning of my appointment, I wore my hair in a ponytail, and I know how thick the hair was. After she cut my hair, when I got home I tried to put my hair back in a ponytail, and about half of the hair was GONE! The ponytail was so thin, it was pathetic. I was absolutely horrified because I NEVER told her to thin anything--I NEVER tell hairdressers that because my hair is already naturally fine and thin. Not to mention, the way she left the sides cut, the layers are too short for the pony, but too long (and uneven!) hanging down. It just looks ridiculous; the pony is about as thick as say, a 4-year-old girl's, and I am not exaggerating. And, I STILL have 3 large, chunky layers in the back. My hair grows very slowly; it will take me YEARS to grow that back out in the back now.

It has been about two months since Nadine cut my hair, and it's grown out enough that I can really see how poorly she cut on the layers. I cannot believe it took her 2 hours to do what she did, because the layers are STILL too long. What's worse, she charged me for a full haircut for this! I had read somewhere in the reviews on Yelp that first-time clients received 50% off. Apparently, I misunderstood, as that didn't apply to Salon D'Shayn as a whole, but rather it's up to the individual stylist to decide if they want to offer that bonus. Unfortunately for me, the stylist they assigned to me doesn't offer that discount, and she charged me $50 for a full haircut, even though I had explained to both the girl that booked the appointment, and to Nadine the stylist, that the hair was already cut, I just needed it trimmed, to even out any uneven layers, THAT WAS ALL. I should have been warned ahead of time that she would have to charge me for a full cut, that there would be no discounts. When I left, at first I was happy, because she had blow dried and brushed it out all nice and pretty. It wasn't until I got home and combed it out myself that I saw what she did. I didn't return for a fix because I didn't want her removing any more hair! Wish it'd been better. Never returning.",Beauty
fIyOopNmb3A1HP_o78e8SA,RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,PBZyumZ_0vSijc2zODdqgQ,2017-04-08,"Just happened to catch their signage while driving past their location on W Flamingo and Durango. I noticed the ""Bowl"" and thought it might have been another new Poké ""Bowl"" place that is the latest food trend in Vegas and many of the western states.  Or a retro hair salon featuring vintage ""Bowl"" cuts that some of us sported in the 70s and 80s. Thank heaven it is actually a trendy Asian fusion restaurant and not the latter.

Bowl Tique Avenue actually have their menu on the BeyondMenu App, which I was prompted to download when I tried to look at what they offered.  Pretty high tech and it is the first business that I know that accepts Apple Pay (which Yelp has been asking about for awhile when I check in to businesses).

So while I pulled over about two giant blocks down the door and studying their menu, I decided to give them a try and also test drive the BeyondMenu App.  The ordering process is super easy, just select the item and the quantity and add it to the cart. If your total reach a certain threshold for using their online coupon on BeyondMenu, the app will prompt you for the option to use it.  Very user friendly!!!

The Chinese cooks (possibly the users) were preparing my order of their Signature Fried Rice, side orders of Grilled Chicken Thigh and Pork Tenderloin. As a young Caucasian waitstaff greeted me and handed me one of the menu, which he explained has additional coupons that is not on the BeyondMenu App.  I also learned that the very modern and clean restaurant that sports an open kitchen design just opened last Sunday, so they are pretty much off the radar being in business for just 6 days.

As I was planning to watch a few episodes of HGTV's Fixer Upper, I had my order to go, and payment was done when I placed the order through the app. But the restaurant decor is very pleasant and the dining room fairly large, that I would enjoy dining in the next time I am in the mood for a different kind of Chinese take out.

The fried rice I ordered was very large. Easily enough to share between two adults with normal appetite. The Grilled Chicken was prepared nicely and seasoned just right and would totally be the perfect lazy way to meal prep you of your proteins.  The Pork Tenderloin appeared to be prepared Chinese style with velveting of the meat, so it is tender and moist.

Overall I thought the guest service experience is very good. Immediately after handing my to go order the young waitstaff headed for the exit to open the door and wish me a pleasant evening (simple courteous gestures that are very typical of traditional Japanese restaurants), which I have yet to experience at any Chinese takeout restaurants.

The food was good, nothing fancy, but certainly hit the spot twice over. Being so close to where I live, I will likely head back and give other menu items a try (like their noodles or fried pork cutlet).

MBxc-_JNX1hICuhYwUchlQ,uYnjK07gmwoiQUhJl5odow,sWgWKThsJPTWuqFEExo_jw,2016-08-14,"If you are looking for used clothes that are nicer brands at a good price, and have the patience to dig, this is a great place to go. Despite being packed with people the day that I was there, they did seem to stay pretty on top of things in terms of keeping sizes and categories together. Also, most of the employees that a came into contact with were very polite and friendly and pleasant. Those are the pros. 

Now for the cons. 
My main reason for going to Clothes Mentor was to sell some items. We are downsizing, so it was time to face my clothing addiction. I have tons of business casual stuff from a couple of years ago when I had to dress up every day for work. I also have far more casual, everyday stuff than I actually need. Everything that I set aside to take to CM was a brand name (mostly Express, Banana Republic, Gap, and Old Navy), and in my opinion, in perfect condition. If it had pills, a snag, any discoloration, stretch, or general signs of wear (i.e., if it didn't look brand new), it went into the Goodwill pile. 
   
So, I walk in and ask if they were doing consignments today. The girl behind the counter said they were, and told me it would be 20 minutes if I wanted to look around the store for a bit. I started browsing the racks (it was my first time in there), and was surprised at the quality of some of the items. Some of the jewelry was discolored, purses had stitching and strings coming loose where you could see threads, and several pairs of shoes had significant scuffing and obvious wear. There were also several shirts that I picked up that were faded, and many others that had pilling. It seems that there are some brands (Coach, MK...), that they will take regardless of what condition they are in, because they know there are people who will buy it for the label. 

Then, the fitting room situation was a bit of a fiasco. There was a huge line, and you were supposed to write your name on a list to be called for your turn in the fitting room. The problem is, there wasn't a sign or anything stating this, so people were getting frustrated because they would wait in the line, get to the front, find out they had waited for nothing, get their name on the list, and have to start over. 

After meandering and trying on and basically killing time for an hour, I went back to the front to see where they were with my things, since they had said 20 minutes. She checks her paper and says ""Your approximate wait time is just over 3 hours"". 3 hours???!!!! I was told 20 minutes an hour ago! Apparently, they don't have a person who is designated as processing intakes. Whenever they are slow enough that they don't need all of the registers open or have constant restocking from the dressing room, they have someone do that. Since they were busy that afternoon, they didn't expect to have anyone working on intakes for at least 3 hours. And you know, I can understand that, but when you tell someone 20 minutes and know they are in the store waiting, and that estimate suddenly goes to 4 hours (my hour plus 3 more), YOU TELL THEM. I told them I would come back before close that evening.

So, I return later. I honestly cannot understand the rhyme or reason of what they accept and what they don't. Everything I brought in was on their list of brands, everything in great shape, the absolute oldest items were 3 years, but many were from the past year or so. They did accept several items (of course at bottom dollar, because they are going to turn around and sell it at $10 for a profit, but that's what you expect to get at these types of places), but said that others were ""too worn"" or ""just wouldn't sell well in our store."" I was pretty perplexed at how something that looked practically new could be ""too worn"" when there were shoes on the racks that were scuffed and stained and beat up, and shirts that had clearly been washed too many times and were pilled and discolored. But again, there didn't really seem to be any rhyme or reason. For example, my bag had 2 dresses in it, both from Express, bought on the same day, both worn one time. They were nearly identical, except for slightly different necklines. One was yellow, one was orange. They took the yellow one and gave me back the orange one. I don't think you can predict if they will take your items or not, regardless of brand or condition. Unless you have some Coach or MK shoes, then you are good! :)",Shopping
VVg-nN5-_KQVRNNDBz12rA,eqORKyk_qKSOif5UXCNMHA,SGIngUI_qmRBDM0_3b55jg,2012-07-27,"Tough critics, first off I'm a total carnivore that have had burgers from mom and pop joints, McDs, Licks, Burger Priest .... and what governs my decisions and reviews is simple accuracy and flavor.

Accuracy in that you can get my burger done correctly every time and still have that same flavor that kept me coming back for more.

I've probably eaten here a good 14 times in the last year and a half, and I live in the burbs not downtown so thats saying something.  

Reviewers say this place is trying to cash in on the gourmet burger craze but is nothing special .... I say these people are idiots that complain for a living.  

If you think this place is nothing special take a look at their menu and tell me which other places gives you the choice cut of meat for you burger?  Um they do, Chuck , Brisket or Sirloin .... oh and you can cook it the way you would eat a steak (though I don't think they do blue, I don't eat blue).

Haters will say but that doesn't change the flavor, hell yeah it does --- unless you been eating steak and foie gras in your daily life, then I'll understand why flavors escape you.

Blue Cheese, Smoked White Cheddar, Pineapple, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Pears, Roasted Red Peppers, Jalapenos, Portobello mushrooms, fried egg, garlic aioli , chipotle aioli, dijon....

Most would say oh but any Gourmet Burger place worth their salt would have these ingredients ... and you'd be right, but its not whats in your pantry its how you use it.  The different burger combos are gold, simple gold.

Their fries are fish & chips style with skin, amazing (though a bigger portion would be appreciated).  Their onion rings are fantastic, I think they use Japanese bread crumbs cause its not the heavy oil soaked batter that most places use.  Its crispy, light, with good onion flavor not overpowering, still fried so a bit oily but not half as much as its old batter'ed cousin.

Now do I finish off this great meal with a pint of Sapporo or a glass bottle of Coke,  I dunno what it is but there is something to the way coke cools in a glass bottle and tastes that just can't duplicated in plastic.  And I really applaud a burger joint for offering Sapporo, nice crisp, clean taste that cools you down and not harsh aftertaste.... just lingering flavor of the burger you just ate.

This place granted looks like a shoebox but its got heart, so all the haters can suck it.  Though I will say this if the owner is reading, accordian style glass front so when its summer you can open it up and have a flow from the patio to inside seemlessly.

EDIT: 07\/18\/2014   Man this place has gone downhill...they used have the choice of ordering sirloin burger, but they took that off the menu.  The last two times I came here just got worse.  Don't bother going here anymore.... I'll give it maybe one star, at the most!!!",Restaurant

There are just too many middling hacks practicing ""upscale American bistro"" cuisine, and I'm tired of throwing my money at them. 

As always, the menu looks so promising. Approximately seasonal. Trendy ingredients. Lots of cool French and Italian words. But unfortunately, reading the menu is the highlight of the night. 

LESSON 1: Don't buy expensive wines from places that REALLY don't know their shit. My first tip off should have been a wine list that was extremely safe. Everything was from conspicuous, high profile California labels, which is a convenient way to earn a free pass if you don't know what you're doing. I asked them to recommend a cabernet (to me, all Napa cabs are crapshoots....I can't afford to drink them often enough to develop any particular loyalties), and I gave them a very generous price range to work with. What they sent us was still not very good. The fruit was too sharp, green and young...not ready for drinking yet. I really don't enjoy spend $80 on a bottle of wine not ready for drinking. Admittedly, this problem goes much deeper than Moe's has complete control over, but restaurants who know their wine will find a way to deliver something good. 

LESSON 2: Seasonal does not equal local. I ordered the rack of venison. The server immediately killed my fantasy of eating a husky, wild-born white-tailed deer by informing me that it was, in fact, farm-raised in New Zealand. What???? You have to get deer imported from halfway around the world? Have you not seen the ZILLIONS of deer in the Cuyahoga Valley, prancing in and out of traffic, eating all the native flora? JUST GO SHOOT ONE! You will be doing everyone a huge favor (except perhaps for the deer itself). By god, I'll help you build the fucking tree-stand. 

As it turns out, my foreign farm-raised deer got overcooked, and was pretty terrible, made worse by extremely bland accompaniments, including whole chickpeas....more on those next: 

LESSON 3: Whole chickpeas suck. Unless they are pureed and deep fried into a falafel by some suspected terrorist and served at 4AM in a shady NYC neighborhood through bulletproof glass, and you believe this particular falafel has the ability to save your life, or at least delay the inevitable vomiting on yourself by a good half-hour....unless all these conditions are met, chickpeas are not worthy of human consumption. They taste like wet cardboard. 

LESSON 4: Glacially slow service. Unforgivably slow service. We were seated there for over 3 hours. Longer than your average major league baseball game. Longer than it takes the Browns to lose 38-3. 

And here's the key thing....you pay a severe physiological penalty by having to wait over an hour between appetizer and entree. Namely, YOU LOSE YOUR APPETiTE!!! The stomach says, ""Ok, my work here is apparently done,"" and proceeds to tell you brain not to feed it anymore. So, here I am faced with the prospect of suffering through a $33 dollar entree that's overcooked and that I'm not remotely hungry for, because my stomach clocked out about forty minutes ago. 

What a regrettable time. The duck taco appetizers were good...that's the only thing nice I can say. Otherwise, I would have been better off staying at home with a bag of stale Cheetos.",Restaurant

My husband and I chose to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary here this past weekend and while we enjoyed our visit there are few things that need improvement at this resort. 

I will start with the ""pros"" because I truly believe the place is magical and should be the best resort in the valley. The hotel is gorgeous! The grounds are so lush and it truly is an escape in Phoenix. I love the history of the hotel and reading the book in the room describing the history. The rooms are very private and we love the boutique feel. Also, we splurged for a cabana and that was nice even though the price was very high. The staff is friendly- especially the valet guys and the poor staff working out in the heat by the pool. 

The ""cons"" for this particular trip... first, the pool was extremely dirty. It got to the point that I couldn't even be in the water. Some of the debris was due to all of the palms shedding but in addition to that there were tons of dead bugs, hair, and the water was very cloudy. While much of this is due to the pool being heavily used and that it is very small, possibly the resort could have a staff member clean it hourly to help keep it up- especially when you are paying $15 per drink. If you are an early riser, be aware that there are no services at the pool until 11am. I love the small boutique size of this hotel but unfortunately I thinK they need to renovate the pool and\/or upgrade the size in order to stay competitive in the area. 

Next, the spa was very disappointing this trip. I paid for a facial and the technician spent the first 25 minutes lecturing me. I was basically told that I am wasting my money getting a facial if I don't do at home skin care regimens and if I spend any time in the sun. I am all for education, but I was not visiting a dermatologist, I just wanted a little extra pampering and glow during my vacation. The steam room was not available the first couple of days. The third day it was open but it had a horrible mildew and sewer smell. This same sewer smell was in the shower as well. Usually at spas, there is staff that cleans frequently between people using it. This was not the case here as there was shaving cream all over the walls of the shower, hair on the floor, dust in the lockers, debris on the carpet in the locker room. My robe in my locker did not have a belt so I had to stand out in the lobby holding it closed until the receptionist was finished talking to other people to give me one. And I had mosquitos buzzing in my ear while lounging in the waiting room. This spa is very small compared to other local resorts. 

Valet guys were prompt and very friendly but unfortunately they parked my hubby's new black car under a tree overnight and it had 20 or so white bird droppings all over the car. They were apologetic and made certain it didn't happen the next two nights. 

In regards to the rooms they could use some updating to stay in line with the high price tAgs per night. Our bed was very wobbly, we had to force our door open with our hips, our phone didn't work the first day and the refrigerator is not cold. Lighting is poor as well. You have to call for ice and when they come they bring you a very small bag. 

Lastly, the personalized romantic feel of this resort has changed. In the past they provided bottled water for free each day and turn down service. Now it is part of the mini bar. In the past we also were treated extra special on our anniversary with chocolates and champagne. While it isn't necessarily an expectation, we were a little bummed we didn't receive anything special In our room like we did for our 10 yr. Some other recent guests (within the last month) posted reviews on other sites that they were upgraded to nicer rooms and received champs and chocolates in their rooms. Wonder why some get it and some don't? I will note that my husband told the restaurant we were celebrating so we got flower petals and a bite of dessert (seriously it was one forkful each) at our dinner at T Cooks. My husband enjoyed his dinner at T Cooks but I did not enjoy this menu compared to our last trip a few years ago. 

Overall, I still love this place but I hope it gets a little TLC before our next trip!",Beauty

When we signed up for this deal with the timeshare presentation, we were told that we'd be staying at the Elara Hotel next to Planet Hollywood in the MIDDLE of the strip. The deal was very attractive, so I purchased it.

I booked the hotel and paid $49 extra for staying in the weekend. When I got the my confirmation e-mail back, things got changed. I was placed in the Hilton Grand Vacations Suites instead of Elara Hilton Grand Vacations Hotel. The names are very similar, so it's very confusing. I called back right away and reported about the discrepancy of the booking. They told me Elara was fully booked, and I have to pay $120 extra to reschedule since it's within 13 days. I checked online and saw vacancy at the Elara, but they said those are marketed to be reserved for full price only. NOTHING they can do. They didn't even apologize for placing me in the wrong hotel. And why are you charging me $120 extra for mistakes you've made?

The fact that they are both called ""Hilton Grand Vacations"" makes it confusing, and they are not even similar type of hotel! Elara is more fun and hip for younger generation like me, and Hilton Grand Vacations Suites is for older generations. I think I am ready to retire at the Hilton Grand Vacations Suites without the vibe. Now my Vegas fun weekend got transformed into a retirement weekend for grandpa instead. What a waste.

""Hilton Grand Vacations Suites on the Las Vegas Strip"" is actually ""Hilton Grand Vacations Suites at the end of the Las Vegas Strip"". Now I am just stuck with an inconvenient location of the strip, which makes no differences if I am actually on the strip or not. It is on an inconvenient location ""on the strip"". I just have to drive to go to places on the strip :(

Upon arrival, receptionist at front desk wasn't very friendly. She talked very fast and went over everything with me in 30 seconds. When I asked her to repeat some part of the instructions, she got impatient. After I arrived the room, I found out that the room was full of cigarette smell. I called them. They said the rooms were all supposed to be smoke-free. I smelled the cigarette regardless. They told me to go down to change the room key for the new room. I took the luggage all the way back down and changed the room. I told her the room totally smelled like cigarette, and all she said was ""ok"". She did not appreciate me telling her or apologize for the inconvenience. I informed her so that she could be considerate and clean it better for the next guest, but she didn't seem like she would do anything about it. They should have done better quality control and checked the room before giving the room to the guests.

The Hilton Grand Vacations presentation was good until the mean managers' appearance in the end. They offer snacks (vending machine type) and refreshments. The sales rep's presentation was wonderful, and she's very sweet. She took me to walk around the hotel. The deal was very tempting, but I cannot afford to join at this moment. I told her I wasn't sure about it. She was totally fine and did not pressure me on this. In the end, she asked her manager to come to offer me the deal. Her manager was a Korean guy. When he came, he asked if I was ready to buy it. I told him I wasn't sure. Then he questioned both me and the sales rep rudely why did we sent him here then. Oops, I am in trouble. I got scared and I said I want to look at the numbers. He offered and I refused. He left, then there was a ""survey guy"" who came to ""do a survey"" with me about the presentation, while he's actually the VIP Corporate giving the final push for me to buy. He gave me a more tempting offer, but I had to refuse due to financial reasons, then his face turned black. He was mad.
The presentation ended in 90 minutes, which was nice. Glad that I survived out of the presentation debt free, and I got my $50 Caesars dining certificate. Phew!

I received s private message from this merchant that I had been banned from her store.She didn't have to do that because I would NEVER step foot back in her store.She knew I was not happy with my experience and instead of trying to provide customer satisfaction she yelled at me for giving her a 2 star Yelp review, called me a liar and told me God would punish me.My God does not punish yet he is a forgiving God.Too bad that she does not value customers and gets angry when someone has an opinion.She told me she would send her tapes to the police and Yelp and have me arrested. She does not understand exactly how Yelp works.It is a platform to give consumers a voice for both good and bad service. Maybe next time she will be more aware of ALL customers in her store instead of just a select few. As a side note the customer who was also in the store as the same time as me was given the royal treatment because she was shopping for gowns.Yesterday she told me how much that customer bugs her because she spends 3 hours in the store.I guess there is a certain type you have to be to shop at this merchant and even if you are the right type you have a time limit.strange business model in my humble opinion

FIRST REVIEW: they have some nice designer clothing but the sales people are rude and seem to only want to conduct transactions with certain customers.I bought two beautiful items but when leaving did not feel good as to how I was treated as a customer.Some of the clothing is great but the shopping experience for me was not great. I love to find great deals on designer clothes however do not like being treated rudely by women working in what is basically an up scale thrift store.Sales people should remember the customer is there to spend money not be treated as if they are not good enough for their ""thrift store"". Don't be a snob if you are selling used designer clothing along with items that come from JC Penney's.The jury is still out if I will return or not. I know if I were to be a regular customer I could find some great items but I am not sure I am willing to take a good deal at the price of being treated rudely.Sales approach and attitude of associates should be evaluated in order to align more to customer service over snobby attitude. This is of course is my humble opinion of a customer there to spend money.

10\/12\/15 update
I did give this business another chance and I highly regret it. I was met at the door asking my first and last name and why I only gave her two stars on yelp. If she were to have read my review she would recall I said both nice things and also negative things about my experience. This was my experience in her store. If I felt I was treated rudely then I was. My feelings are valid and as this is America I have the right of free speech. She called me a liar, she told me I was rude and she also told me that God would punish me. This made me even more angry than the way I was treated poorly the first time. God is not punishing God he is a forgiving God. I stood in her store and put my hands in the air and prayed to my God to forgive me if I had done any wrong by this woman. If she knows anything once I did that I was forgiven. She continued to tell me I would be punished by God. Of course she never did the same of asking for forgiveness or even to take ownership of the negative experience I had. She made a comment for me to come back to see if she could make it right by me. Telling me God would punish me is making it right to a customer. If that isn't bad enough she could not even acknowledge that she had an upset customer who was willing to give her a second chance. She was so angry on receiving a two star yelp review that she could not deal with a customer that was less than satisfied. She then proceeded to threaten me that she was going to send all of the tapes from her store to yelp and to the police to have me arrested. How funny is this??? I will be waiting for the police and yelp to come to arrest me for having an opinion. I believe that the last line of my review was this is my humble opinion of course. I will pray for her that she can ask God for forgiveness for her behavior. I will not be giving her a third chance. Anyone who lives by God's principles should not be a patron of the store because she thinks God is a punishing God. I wish her the best for her business and I hope she learns to treat customers better. Maybe learning about God and some customer services courses would help. She told me she was a professor. What a professor of religious ignorance or a professor of customer rudeness. As a side note I found it hysterical that each time I was in her store she was wearing the same outfit. I love to support local business but not this one.I sure hope others will feel the same if she truly believes that I will be punished by God.Of course her story will be slightly different but God knows the truth. Again best of luck for your business. I will pray for this lost soul",Shopping

As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. 
Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!
  
The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!

The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?

Amuse Bouches

Foie gras with black truffle
Crisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. 

Parmesan waffle
Light fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.

Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishes

Fingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!

First Course

Heirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!

Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.

2nd dish

Colors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly

3rd dish

Fish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish

4th dish
Foie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!

5th
Black Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!

6th dish
Filet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.

Desserts

Dessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser

Coconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!

Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!

Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...

But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!

At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.

In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.

I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.

Happy Eats!",Restaurant
V6ozPFKe1ckyExeHczk6uA,rxk524nowsOUvVuY_AsjaA,mvM_bCqtOhtNTQvaRRu0tw,2016-04-14,"My partner and I had our wedding here in early April, 2016. We are a gay couple so this was a same sex ceremony but there really wasn't much that needed to be done differently. Despite every Las Vegas chapel I spoke to saying they do same-sex weddings, I got the feeling that none of them (including Vegas weddings) had extensive experience with them. I wasn't surprised by this and knew it might be a few awkward moments in the planning. There were many times when we sort of had to guide them.

BEFORE THE WEDDING...
Unfortunately, most of the preparations that took place in the month preceding the wedding felt like a pure business transaction. There was almost nothing very personal or special about it. I guess that's not terrible but it should be noted. I was frequently reminded of the rules, particularly the ""no photos on the premises"" rule. We ultimately decided on a package that was part of a special deal - free upgrade to the next level. It included a few things that were specific to a bride so we didn't need those - no problem. We also added on the Elvis experience! I wanted Elvis to do the whole deal, officiate and everything. I wanted the unity candle too.

I was assured several times that they had everything down and the day would be great.

About a week before the ceremony, the planner and I ran through the entire plan for the wedding day again. She was very clear about everything and repeated things that I would call ""rules."" She told us that even though Elvis would officiate, he couldn't -legally- marry us so she said we would go into a room after the ceremony and be legally married by a minister.

DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING....
As planned we were picked up at the hotel to be taken to the clerk's office and then the pre-ceremony meeting. The limo driver was GREAT! No issues that we were both guys. We felt very welcome! We walked over to the chapel and met with a new ""planner"" because our planner didn't work on Saturday's.

Here's the first time I got concerned... we went over everything again. She was either new or uncomfortable. At first, she didn't even mention Elvis. I reminded her. Then she didn't know Elvis was officiating. Reminded her. Reminder her about the candle. She stumbled a bit over some details but the concerning part was things she didn't seem to know at all.

DAY OF THE WEDDING...
Limo driver picks our parents and both of us up at the hotel. Another GREAT guy. They really have good limo drivers! Helps you relax on your way to your wedding! We arrive and check in. I was SO THANKFUL that the guy who was assigned to get us going was a gay man. He was great. Very reassuring.

About 30 minutes before the wedding, we were taken up to a room by the chapel entry. 

Here's where the next concerning part happened and it's not what I wanted to happen less than an hour before the wedding! The minister came in - she was AWESOME. My type of person - dry sense of humor, no issues with it being two guys. SURPRISE #1: We were getting legally married right then! Recall, it was supposed to happen after the ceremony. Alrighty - I told her we needed to get my dad as a witness. Done deal. Married!

UNWELCOME SURPRISE #2: Elvis didn't know he was supposed to officiate! They went out and told him in front of our guests. Thankfully, he was able to do it without any preparation. He then came in and met us. Cool guy. 

THE CEREMONY...
It was great! We had it in the chapel with about 40 guests. Everyone had a great time. That's what matters, right? Elvis was really smooth about telling us what to do - you know, put the rings on, face each other, etc.

They forgot to do the candle. I only realized this when they handed us a big candle as we checked out. We had such a good time, I'm not going to make a big deal about it but it goes to their lacking attention to detail that I've described above.

Despite not pre-purchasing a photo package, we had a photographer that took loads of photos, including posed ones. We knew they were going to try to sell these to us.

NEXT DAY...
We went back to the chapel as planned to view the photos. Our package included 19 candid photos from during the ceremony. Their packages are almost scientifically designed to push you to spend more. Bottom line is that EACH PHOTO COSTS $50. They were up front about the package prices, it's on their web site. We weren't told the per photo price until right then though. We were cornered. What are we going to do? It was our wedding. We bought 10 photos. That's not $500 by the way. It's $500 plus their 19% fee that covers tax and ""service fees."" It's ubiquitous. 

Be forewarned, they charge an additional 19% on EVERYTHING. It's not hidden. They tell you. Just make sure you add it to everything you buy from them.

IN THE END... the part that counts, the wedding itself, was fantastic! They need to tighten up their attention to detail. My advice to you is stay on top of everything and be pro-active about confirming everything you want.",Shopping
Y8cPvPEEu-UHGkuxLKrUrA,8M_eqHwJPg5ha_ygO40oPw,uFZ7Q8JCgGJAaObiYs3ksg,2017-01-02,"[note: there are a bunch of non-recommended 1 star reviews. I recommend you read and believe them, and seriously question the 5 stars. It seems a lot of other folks were just as disgusted as us and created yelp accounts just to put this place on blast, not realizing yelp would stick them in the corner]

So, my girlfriend and I attended the New Year's Gatsby event at Bord'Elle. It was billed as 25+ with a jazz quartet and burlesque as well as circus-style performances.

We walked in at 10:30 and ordered 2 overpriced drinks for $24 at the large bar downstairs. The bar uses an electronically metered pour, so my cognac looked very sad indeed. It appeared to possibly be 1 oz. The space is beautiful, but the music was pulsating techno, not the jazz we were promised.

Looking for an escape from the overcrowded space (it is much smaller than it appears in photos and does not have a dance floor.) We made our way to the upstairs bar and learned from our(awesome) bartender that the jazz was only for dinner service at 6pm(???!) and we would be subjected to the whim of the two terrible DJs all night.

The bathrooms were disgusting, gold toilets did not class it up, and the coke use was not at all discrete. At some point they shut down the upstairs bathrooms. Reading the other reviews I am going to assume this is due to the feces smeared on the wall. My girlfriend had to beg a bouncer to be allowed to rejoin me upstairs after using the ladies room downstairs(which had no toilet paper- a fact she brought to the attention of multiple people, non of whom's job this was apparently.) It was nice to know that our spot had suddenly become so exclusive and VIP, but seriously guy, you just watched her come down the stairs.

We finally ventured downstairs just prior to midnight, when the music became slightly more tolerable and danceable, but the ADD DJs could not leave a track on for more than 20 seconds. As soon as the crowd's mood turned to dancing they would change the song. In hindsight, maybe it was for the best, since there was no room to dance.

Also, the billed ""burlesque dancing"" happened once in the 3.5 hours we were there, unless you count the girl on the swing, who was on the swing 2 times- and I am assuming that was the circus-like entertainment.

The worst part is this: TIckets cost $65 in advance. I could have paid the same to go to an open bar with coked out bros and barely legal girls at a bunch of other clubs. We chose this one because it sounded like a relaxing, fun and stylish way to ring in the New Year. We were sadly mistaken. Also, no champagne toast. You could not get champagne at the bar we were at upstairs, nor at the main bar. To obtain a glass you could only go to the other upstairs bar(for real? it's New Year's eve) and pay $15 for a flute of Prosecco. It seems enough people found the vibe as lame as we did, since they decided they could offer $25 admission after midnight.

Scariest part of the evening: We carefully stood near a ""sortie"" (EXIT) at all times, due to the fact that all bottle-service(and there was a lot of it) was escorted by giant sparklers, including a menorah of sparklers going out with a magnum of Monet. Coming from a state where a club-fire caused by fireworks killed 100 people, I was very wary of how close these sparklers came to igniting the balloons and the low-ceiling upstairs. I can't believe this is actually a thing.

Highlight of the night: the bartender upstairs, who seemed like a genuinely good guy.

After reading all the other reviews I am so glad that we opted not to go for dinner service. Our last minute walk-in at Nouveau Palais was the best decision we made that night. Anyway, I recommend never going to this place. Ever. It is pretty, but there are much better spots.

Oh, and just as an aside. If you own a $3k clutch(or even if you don't) and order $100 worth of drinks, a $2 tip is not appropriate. People are so cheap it hurts.",Restaurant
hsSN7ebLuebyi6x5EW9IEA,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,DGX2ldVGub9F1EAU9R7C5A,2010-08-10,"Getting off the vacation review kick, back to some LV reviews!  Even better, this one is a first to review for me!

I know most of you have been to a Subway at one time or another and many of you are 'Yay!' and some of you are 'Blah.'  But this Subway here by my part of town is my fav place to pick up a Subway sub!  This one is pretty new, maybe a year old or so and is the sub shop is connected to a Winchell's Donut.  Pretty good way of cancelling out the benefits of eating healthy, eh Subway?  Get a sub with all the veggie fixins' and chase it with an order of glazed donut holes?  Meal of champions I tell you!  

This is my fav Subway mainly because their ingredients are always super fresh looking whenever I go there.  The assistant manager I met there (I refer to these guys as the 'Ass. Man.' ha ha) said he tries to run a pretty tight ship because other Subways he's been to don't  live up to the company's high standards.  His efforts must be paying off because he mentioned that this particular Subway has been consistently getting the most sales on the SW part of town the past several months.  That's saying a lot because there is a Subway on almost every block you go.  See kids, high quality always leads to high profits!  Don't skimp on your standards.

Back to the sandwiches.  The ingredients here I can see are always fresh, nothing ever looks old.  The tomatoes aren't soggy, the lettuce isn't wilted, and the red onions aren't stinky-slimy.  This Subway even serves spinach!  Rare find in this town, most Subways I go to don't have this on their veggie menu.  I've never been let down by any of the sandwiches I've gotten here, I leave pretty satisfied.  The bread is fresh and fluffy (not flattened like you see at some Subways) and the meats don't look like they've been sitting out all day.  

Personally, I love the Subway $5 foot long menu.  I work out a lot so I'm happy knowing I can go have a cheap, healthy meal afterwards.  One of my fav sandwiches is the Oven Roasted Chicken Breast with ALL the veggies, provolone, extra lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, light mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper.  Another one of my favs is the Spicy Italian.  I also like the Meatball Marinara with provolone, tomatoes, spinach, bell peppers, and banana peppers.  So good toasted!  Lately, I've been on their Orchard Chicken Salad sandwich kick (ahem...not toasted, ick), I like the apples and golden raisins in it.  And for $5 for a foot long...with chips or 2 cookies and a drink for under $8?  I can use this sandwich for 2 meals, unless I'm super hungry!  Or have to share with my fiance...which means I have to remove my double order of red onions (sigh).  And give her one of my cookies.  Fine, fine.  You can have my Oatmeal Raisin, but the Chocolate Chip is mine!

Another few reasons I love this Subway?  The service and the cleanliness.  The staff have always been pleasant to me and never complain when trying to pack my over-stuffed sandwich (they have been known to be super heavy because of my veggie obsession) into a bag.  This place is usually pretty clean too, bathroom is kept up, and the floors are always mopped.  if you find a dirty area let them know and someone will be on it.  

One of the coolest things about this Subway?  It's open 24 hours a day!  First one in my area, now if I have a late night craving for a sub I can drive down here at 2 in the morning if I want (I sometimes do on those long, Halo 3 filled nights).  I heard this Subway (and subsequently, Winchell's) is open 24 hours because a big part of their clientele are the nurses and doctors that work in the St. Rose hospital almost literally right next door.  In fact, the hospital is large chunk of their revenue.  This Subway also makes it easy for you too with a drive thru.  Yep, a Subway drive thru!  Don't even have to get out of my car for a Subway fix.  Hey doc, you got a heart surgery in 5 minutes?  No problem!  Just don't forget to wash your hands after you eat.",Restaurant
2PTu869kiZmHmrI8H0GBjg,wtZYwTUiemSIEQd973fsbg,ACBC7mTesZDsykfMios-DA,2017-10-06,"Background: My longtime boyfriend and I have been ring shopping for a while. I bought a ring on eBay. I took a big chance on it... It had an appraisal with a few misspellings referencing an EGL USA cert the prior owner had 'lost' and the price was too good to be true - HUGE red flags, but I really loved this ring! My other half spent $12k on my must-have red flag ring and I needed it checked out pronto.

I looked up ""jewelry appraisers"" on Yelp; these guys came up #1 in my area and off I went.

I was BEYOND impressed! I didn't even have makeup on and didn't spend and money today, but everyone treated me like gold. Incredible knowledge and service.

Short version: WOW! I found my new jewelry place. Long version below.

I spoke to Jay, explained everything. He tested the ring for me then grabbed his brother, Marc, who is their appraiser to give it more of a look. Like me, they were very suspicious and looked the ring over multiple times and multiple ways to confirm. The info from the EGL cert was a bit generous (classic EGL to slightly over grade) but it was a real diamond and a steal for what I paid. I didn't want to leave it for a full appraisal or resizing (I definitely trusted them, just need my brand new ring on my finger to show to family before I part with it for a few days).

They didn't charge me at all! WHAT!?! I have had many things appraised\/verified over the years, and I have never had someone spend that much time\/effort checking something out for free. Honestly, a few other times I've just wanted something I bought online verified, other places couldn't get me out of the store fast enough.

I had an unexpected, nice, long chat with Jay about everything from jewelry insurance to watches to customer service, and I learned a lot about the business. For example:
- Family owned! Mom, dad, brothers, nieces. Impressive credentials on all of them too.
- Everyone has their own niche. There's an appraiser, a few custom designers, a watch expert, you name it.
- Lovely selection, especially in engagement rings, miscellaneous rings and earrings. I wasn't there to shop, but a few things caught my eye.
- All work is done ON SITE. They don't send your treasures off to some unknown third party.
- Great prices. Their appraisal quote was lower than what I've been quoted elsewhere, and it comes with free updates for life every few years. Add-on appraisal items are at a good discount. Their resizing quote was very competitive, too. Didn't check out jewelry prices, but I bet they are fair.
- Friendly, honest, up-front. Wow, you don't see service like this very often. Also explained things thoroughly in terms anyone can understand. Very down-to-earth and happy to share their knowledge.
- They buy Rolexes and jewelry too. I don't ever sell so I didn't get details, but now you know.

I will definitely be back to have my lovely new engagement ring appraised and resized. I will likely buy my future hubby's wedding ring from them (one caught my eye). And I will definitely bring along more jewelry for appraisal\/miscellaneous work as well.

The only con? Estate\/vintage\/antique jewelry is my 'thing'... really my thing. 80%+ of my jewelry collection is 1880s to 1950s. I can count the number of pieces I own made in the last decade on one hand. And while they have some lovely vintage-inspired styles, they only sell new. I really, really wish they sold estate jewelry.

Burland definitely lives up to its excellent Yelp rating and has my business!",Shopping
CQo7bGnimWZXg8gBRS3HAw,Wxd-EKF2Z4RHZUmwQ6Eeew,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2013-12-30,"I'm torn as to how to rate the Vdara because some aspects were so good and some were so bad, but overall I was pretty satisfied, especially for the price paid.  

The Good. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, very clean, and come with kitchenettes (microwave, fridge, small range).  Our room (the cheapest category) was on the 37th floor and had a beautiful view of Bellagio fountains & Paris.  The lobby area is beautiful and clean.  The hotel is non-gaming and totally smoke free, which is the big reason we picked it.  There is no smoke stench in the room at all and we all felt like it was a calm, quiet, nice-smelling oasis from the rest if the strip.  The pool is not huge or fancy by Vegas standards but is good-size for a hotel pool and was WARM - we went swimming in late December!  Nice daybeds and cabanas.  The hotel is close to both Aria and Bellagio which have lots of food and entertainment options.  There is free wifi (well, included in resort fee) which worked pretty well.  The gym was really nice but quite crowded.  The Vdara Market Cafe in lobby is convenient for a quick bite and has pretty decent albeit croissants and other breakfast\/snack items.  The rooms are the most soundproof hotel rooms I've ever stayed in; we never heard a soul.   

The Bad.  Our main problem was with the service, particularly with housekeeping.  Although the rooms come with kitchenettes, they don't include any plates, glasses, cutlery etc and you have to call and request it.  The first night my mom requested some and they did not bring it to her before she went to bed (several hours later).  They did leave it outside her room as requested, so she could have dishes as soon as she woke up.  Our first full day, although we were out of the rooms most of the day, neither of our two rooms got made up.  This was not a big deal, except my husband and I needed new towels and water bottles and my parents needed water bottles and clean dishes.  My mom called around 6 pm and requested what they needed and they told her they would be there by 8 at the latest (my parents go to bed early and were also coming from Central Time two hours ahead, so it was important that it be done on time).   An hour or so later, my husband called with our request.  He was on hold with housekeeping for 15-20 minutes but when he finally got through they brought up our towels and water bottles fairly promptly (within 30 mins).  When the guy came to our room I told him my parents had called quite awhile ago and were still waiting, he basically said that someone else would come and there wasn't anything he could do about it.  Super helpful.  

Finally, just before 8, a housekeeper showed up and said she would come back soon.  She finally came back closer to 8:30.  That was bad enough, but the absolutely ridiculous thing was that she took close to an hour to clean my parents room (so it was finally clean 1.5 hrs after they were promised it would be) and another hour to clean ours.  We thought it was taking so long because they were washing dishes, but when my parents finally got back in their room all the dishes were gone!! Fortunately she was still cleaning our room so my mom stopped her and at least got clean mugs - she had no other dishes though.  They also took about an hour to clean our room and we didn't get in it until close to 10:30.  I'm not sure how on earth it takes 1  hour to clean a hotel room, especially when there are no dishes to be washed or anything.  The only thing they had to do was make up the bed and pick up towels off the floor - not sure how that can possibly take more than 20 minutes or so.

To be fair, all of the problems with housekeeping happened on Christmas Day and they may have been understaffed. But we all found it odd and very frustrating that there are no dishes in the rooms AND it takes hours to get them from housekeeping. 

The other really annoying thing about the Vdara is that the parking is valet only, no self park.  Although the valet is ""complimentary"" you have to tip every time they bring your car up, so its not really free.   You also have to wait for them to bring your to you.  We regularly waited 15-20 minutes and calling ahead for the car did not work.  Although they don't really advertise this, you can also self-park in Aria's garage, but this means that in addition to walking 10+ minutes to the hotel, you also have no choice but to exit the garage onto the strip, with its absolutely horrific traffic.  If you valet at the Vdara, you can exit onto a side street and get right onto the highway without going on the strip.  So although both options are fairly inconvenient, the self-park is definitely worse.

Overall, I do recommend the hotel especially if you don't smoke and are looking for a quieter Vegas experience but if you have a car and\/or want to cook any food or hot beverages in your room, ask for things well in advance and prepare to wait.",Beauty

The Other Place was very much back in business.

Feeling a little foolish, and hoping Jennie hadn't noticed, he straightened up and they took their seats; a small, round, European-influenced table, far enough from the patio doors to avoid the glare of the sun yet close enough to appreciate the cooling breeze that whipped by outside.

Almost instantly they were greeted by their waitress, a petit and cheerful girl with an accent that served to echo their surroundings. They placed the usual drinks order: a white wine (large) for her; a Jack and Coke (Diet) for him.

Typically they discussed the events that had momentarily staggered the Other Place's opening week. Looking up, they could easily differentiate between old and new ceilings. The largest flat section was now a spread of grey mortar, but all the rest retained its classic elegance. There were three sections over the bar area in all, chandeliers hung centrally from all, but the older two also held circular mirrors that rounded the light fixtures, and the detailed cornicing, with its ornate engravings, were captivating.

A moment later Joe spotted their drinks, albeit atop a waiter's tray that was headed the wrong way. The waiter seemed not to know where the beverages were destined to be but Joe certainly did and intervened just as the waitress with the accent pointed out their table.

The summer weather had drawn an unexpected crowd, or so it seemed from the tables that had been amassed inside. This by no means made their stay uncomfortable but the impromptu table layout was obviously leading the waiting staff a merry chase as a result. Spirits were high and the waiter made his apologies by way of some charming banter, which they both appreciated.

Then their waitress returned. ""Ready to order?"" she said with an enthusiastic smile.

""Absolutely,"" Joe replied. ""If the portion is big enough, we'd like to share the Spicy Shrimp and Chorizo starter...?""

He glanced at Jennie as he spoke, her cool green eyes glittering thoughtfully as if she was trying to calculate how much food she might manage, before she confirmed his choice with a nod.

Joe smiled appreciatively, ""And for mains...?"" He gestured to his partner to take the lead.

""I'll have the Chilli Cheese Dog with extra Fried Onions,"" Jennie said, decisively.

""And for me, the Juicy Lucy with the Hash Brown topping.""

While they waited for their first course, they took in the place. Beforehand it had been an old gentleman's public house, with a name involving a Stag or some other woodland creature no doubt. The transformation was impressive; the room in which they sat now the bar area, while the upper level housed the open-face kitchen, artfully circled by an array of stools for those who wished to watch their food being prepared.

The bar itself was rather impressive too, Art Deco in style - much like the majority of the decor and furnishings - with a vast selection of bourbons and rums, whiskies and wines on display. Joe had heard rumour they stocked 100 various beers and ales back there too.

The Shrimp and Chorizo dish could not have been any better. A perfect sharing dish, but good enough to make Joe wish he'd bought his own. The shrimp soft and delicate, the chorizo veritably haemorrhaging flavour; it needed to be tried to be believed. Joe initially added the romantic touch of sharing the dish with the same fork, however he had clearly forgotten how slowly Jennie tended to eat, so - once he'd tasted that chorizo - snapped up the spare fork with fervour.

Equally so, they enjoyed their mains. The Chilli Dog as messy animal indeed, and Jennie used her cutlery wisely, albeit to Joe's horror (few things in this world must be eaten by hand but both burgers and hotdogs are at the apex of that list). The chilli itself, which they had experienced once before, was interesting in that it closer resembled pulled pork, but in no way was that a criticism; it was delightful.

The burger patty was handmade, and clearly so as it crumbled juicily with each bite. Stuffed with subtle cheese and topped with a flaky hash brown, his only gripe was that the latter was under-seasoned. Despite that negative, he made a note to contact all his friends on the quest for Edinburgh's Best Burger to take note of The Other Place.

The meal had been a test. A test of the Other Place and what they were bringing to the capital. A test of how they intended to compete with neighbouring Stockbridge without being as wanky. A test of why they could justify some of the prices on their menu.

It was test they passed.",Restaurant
ryPdIqpSpDImW9L7afzfoA,oL0NtgEGpfh0WvobQq_Xyw,4cWrtMvfj-tomyEPgP7KFg,2010-03-12,"This is my favorite restaurant for special occasions because fondue is, well, fun! But it is a bit pricier than we usually budget for dinner out: our bill usually runs about $90-$120 for two with drinks. We have been to this location as well as the Montgomery, Ohio (Cincinnati suburbs) location several times. The service is always exceptional and it seems staff truly enjoys working at The Melting Pot. The ambience is low-key, but slightly upscale. Most of the booths are laid out for privacy.

Our standard choice is the Fondue For Two, a three-course fondue plus salad dinner that is more than enough, and a bottle of wine or two. The waitstaff will be happy to recommend a bottle from their extensive collection of wine. All fondue courses are prepared at the table on the built-in hotplate.

With fondue there comes several choices. First, the cheese course gives the option of Cheddar, traditional Swiss, Wisconsin butterkase\/buttermilk blue cheese or a spicy Mexican-style cheese fondue served with bite-size bread cubes, raw vegetables and apples. We have always enjoyed the traditional Swiss cheese fondue, but I think I'd also like to try the Wisconsin.

Then, comes the salad, which you shouldn't fill up too much on even though their California greens with gorgonzola and rasperry walnut vinaigrette is delicious. Tip: you can buy the salad dressing in bottles to duplicate the salad at home.

For the main course, you will choose from several fondue styles and meats. Standard fondue choices will be oil or bouillon (vegetable broth), but for an additional fee, you can choose Coq au Vin fondue (herbs, mushroom, garlic and burgundy wine) or Caribbean bouillon with garlic and citrus flavor. The standard bouillon is low-sodium, cholesterol-free, light and healthy that does not add bulk to the meal (that pays off at the end). The meat selections include their standard chicken breast, pork tenderloin, shrimp, teriyaki sirloin and fresh fish fillet (based on availability); the market-price ""surf and turf"" with lobster tail, Filet Mignon  and portobello mushrooms; or the pricier pacific rim with teriyaki sirloin, breast of duck, pork tenderloin, chicken breast, and potstickers. All of the above come with bite-sized portions of red potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, squash, and a variety of dipping sauces. The meats and vegetables come to the table raw and you will cook them yourself in the broth\/oil, then dip and eat. See? Fun!

Hope you saved room for dessert because this is where fondue becomes sensuous. Again, you have choices to make. Chocolate comes in dark, milk, and white which you can choose unadulterated or with additives, like Bailey's Irish Cream, or Amaretto, or marshmallows and crushed Oreo cookies, or caramel and pecans. They have pre-selected combinations or create your own. I love dark chocolate + Bailey's Irish creme instead of their milk chocolate + Bailey's. ""Yin-Yang"" is pretty: dark chocolate swirled with white chocolate. Dessert fondue is served with fresh strawberries, cheesecake, pound cake, marshmallows, bananas, brownies and pineapple for dipping. This is also a good time to switch to coffee to start coming down from the wine-buzz and endorphins before attempting to drive home.

I have never walked out of this place unhappy, although I have walked out completely stuffed and pleasantly buzzed. We will keep coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, and leave the Valentine's Day crowds for the more adventurous. Related, I have one request of TMP diners: please, introduce your kids to fondue at home. This is most definitely NOT the place for less-than-well behaved young children.",Restaurant
ScdTL_znimcdW8ukNg_0rg,R9YBu5t8OZ0nUNyeNkznbw,TabGgpRrdIis5LDC70TIqg,2011-01-17,"While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.

Sing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.

This particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.

There were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's ""Growing Pains."" I was sold from that point on.

I will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.

Drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. 

The only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food\/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. 

Ooops!

All and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.",Restaurant
lTVHX1VigC39Mooe3v5RVQ,0BBUmH7Krcax1RZgbH4fSA,a1anU36vAuQdC8IIiOSBRg,2011-06-03,"This brand new  No Frills, does not give you the dirty dungy yellow feel that you get from most other locations. In fact it's the complete opposite! Bright lights, high ceilings and neatly stocked merchandise makes a huge difference and goes a long way. 

Yesterday I spent 1.5 hours here grocery shopping for a cottage trip. I came out with 2 carts full of stuffs, I felt like I was on Extreme Couponing but lacking the coupons.

Parking is free for 90 mins. All you do is go up to the machine,1) press the blue button 2) press the green button - no need to stick any change or card in the machine. 

The produce section was well maintained, and I'm always impressed by the guys that constantly go and inspect items as they re-stock and check for moldies and remove them. They were pretty friendly about it when I passed them a moldy box of strawberries. It's not their fault, it does come like that in the batch. 
Corn today was 10 for $5. Apples for 0.69\/lb. Potatos $4\/10lbs. Box of blueberries $3.99 (why are they always so $$). Box of strawberries $2.99. Usually the produce here is fresh. And for more pre packaged items, there are price checked weekly. 

A bulk section follows, but mainly only nuts and candies. 

Then the Bakery Section. Unfortunately No Frills doesn't really carry non-pre packed bread, and there were only two loaves of baked bread - and no one there to slice it. If it wasn't for this cottage trip, I would have gone elsewhere to buy. There was no Spelt bread. 

The meat section lines the back wall. Chicken was all sold out at $1.30something \/ lb.  Burger patties at 30% off was the same price as the frozen ones at the back but with less preservatives. 
I also discovered that the Sausages in the meat section have all natural ingredients including a Hog Casing, than the ones in the bacon and cold cuts section. 

The aisles were clearly marked, with price checks almost everywhere.  Lots of things to buy, wide aisles made for easy maneuverering of all my stuff.  They had a lot more selection than I would have expected for a No Frills, including lots of Gluten Free products you only see in Big Carrot or something. Even my Hemp granola bars were cheaper here by 50c than in Bulk Barn. 
Classico tomato sauce was $2 on sale. 
And I love seeing prices that are only 2 digits with a decimal place to the left.  

Milk, and eggs are along the far East wall. And Ice Cream near the front.

There is also a pharmacy section with shampoos and bandaids and things, just like a Loblaws. I swear you'd like you were in one. 
You forget you are in a No Frills and really pleased with the prices of everything. That is until you get to the cash. 

Cash lady wasn't cheery at all, and kind of needed a pick me up after shopping til 9pm. We held up a bunch of people with all our stuff, but it's not my fault that they only had 3 registers and no one opening another till. 

I guess no one buys this much stuff because the conveyor was small and narrow, and she didn't bat and eye or gave a crap that she squished all my chips. 
You still bag everything yourself, but with this much stuff and use of lots of boxes and what not, we needed to do it ourselves. 

I love shopping at No Frills because for 15 people for 3 days I spent $300. This one especially.",Shopping
P4O5rAADkLqtUghcT5pYvw,VU2lpEyNSp16Gk8Ujrkiqw,n6GEL5PDQ3ZvZ5HtxIhGFA,2015-05-16,"This place is possibly the worst dining experience my family and I have ever had. This is a case of: if it looks like a disaster, it will be a disaster. 

I saw them listed for Arizona Restaurant Week and they had one of the best deals - for $33 per couple you could share 1 appetizer, get 2 pizzas and share 1 dessert. Plus it included 2 beverages - wine, beer or soda. So I convinced my family we should check it out. We had 5 adults, 1 toddler and 1 baby. 

I called to make a reservation and got us in. We got there and it was in a strip mall and had its two front doors wide open. You could see into the dining room (very small - maybe 10 tables - all different sizes with mismatched chairs and some were even ottomans!) and people were waiting outside. 

2 young men were running around looking totally overwhelmed and I wasn't greeted for ten minutes as there was no notable host stand or procedure. 

The rest of my party arrived and we surveyed the situation discussing whether to leave or try it and decided to try it - BIG mistake.

We were seated and left there for 20 minutes - no one greeting us or bringing us waters. Our toddler was getting thirsty so we were again debating whether to just get up and leave. Just then a 3rd young man asked if we were being helped and we said no! They apologized and brought us water and menus. 

When our waiter finally came to take our order, we asked what wines were included in the deal - he pointed out a Chardonnay and Merlot. Then he said there was one other white wine included but was not on the menu. We asked what kind - he said ""just a white - like a Chardonnay."" We pressed further and he said it was a Pinot Grigio so my sister and I ordered that. Lol. 

Now it was not just annoying but comical. We came to realize the place was next to a cooking school and every few minutes someone new (obviously with the school\/restaurant) would come thru a door in the adjoining wall - carrying supplies, carrots and one point even a bucket and toilet plunger (gross!). 

If the restaurant was a cooking school restaurant, run by students of the school, it should be apparent on the website and you would know what you were getting into in the first place. This is not advertised as such anywhere.  But that's the only thing that makes sense to explain the horrible service and food. 

We ordered 2 appetizers- the brocolini with burrata and roasted cauliflower. Both were served luke warm, if not cold and were not good.  For pizzas we ordered 5: 2 sausages, 1 pepperoni\/mushroom\/onion, 1 margarita, and 1 walnut.  They were decent - good flavors. I wanted salt and pepper but no one came by for me to ask for it and we could not get their attention until I was done!  But they were the smallest individual pizzas I've seen. They were about 10-11 inches where most are closer to 16"". 

By that time we tried to wave down anyone to put in our dessert order and get our check. To make it easy we ordered 2 of the Nutella banana crepes. 

Literally 20 minutes later (1 hr 40 minutes since we sat down, mind you) we were about to cancel the order and leave when they said there were just putting them on?! What?! We placed the order 20 minutes ago?!  And they are crepes!

10 minutes later they came out - the smallest underwhelming plate ever - two little roll-ups with some sauce drizzled over and a sprig of mint. But I thought they still may be good - most portions today are too big anyways - but no. They were cold (nothing about them was even warm), with very little bananas or Nutella. We left most of it on the plates.

We finally got out of there 2 hours from when we sat down! Will never go there again....

I would have given no stars if I could. 

Pretty much the most horrible dining experience of my life.",Shopping

day one - didn't realize it was a valet-only hotel, but whatever we used cabs all week anyway but more on the valet to come :-\/ check in was smooth, requested a fountain view room and they gave it to me (not surprised though it was a tuesday - friday stay so its not like the hotel was at capacity anyway)
the room: first impression was great we liked the set up of the room (2 tvs, one in the bedroom and one on the other side of the built in where the couch was.) we got the studio style room.
then it all went down hill from there none of the lights worked and the safe was open but locked so we couldn't store our items in it and go to the pool right away like we had planned. so I called the front desk and i told them the lights were out and that i didnt know how to use the safe. ""the instructions are on the inside of the safe"", says the front desk clerk. ""there aren't any instructions in my safe"", i said. ""well they should be, i dont know how to use it let me get someone who does"", says clerk""... REALLY? she must have been new. anyways we waited 30-45 minutes for someone to come up and fix our lights (they were shut off from the main electric panel in the room) and then i had to wait another 30 mintues for security to come unlock the safe and show me how to use it. 
At this point the pool was closing in an hour so we rushed to unpack, change and get down to the pool. 

the pool: its small but it does the job, luckily being midweek, it wasn't crowded but nothing impressive, my in-laws pool is nicer. 

first night\/morning after: being exhausted from traveling all day I crashed hard. next morning, i wake up with sharp pain in my lower back ( i sleep on my stomach ) and in the morning i inspect the mattress and spring box to find that it had been sat on my Godzilla and broke the mattress! probably the worst sleep i ever got in my entire life. so i call the front desk and i tell them politely that i think the mattress is broken . so again we wait 20 minutes for housekeeping to bring up a mattress for the sofa bed, apparently the clerk thought i was talking about the sofa mattress. keep in mind breakfast buffet was going to end in an hour and i wanted to resolve this before leaving but there wasnt any time  so i go down to the front desk after breakfast and let them know the whole situation and every problem with the room ( lights malfunction, water faucet pressure, safe, mattress and also the ac wouldnt cool lower than 75')  

the clerk was very nice, he apologized and offered to move us to another room, and offered to take care of the resort fees for us( which is great because we planned on visiting other pools and would have to pay the resort fees there in order to use their pool) we really didnt want to move rooms since we had unpacked and organized everything into our room. so that was a pain. but that mattress drove us out of that first room

anyway , get to the new room, its small. 1 tv. and different set up. so disappointing becasue we loved the set up of the other room. in the new room the couch didnt even face the tv. hated the lay out. but lights worked, ac went down to 71 and faucet had pressure. mattress still felt very used but better than the first. 

the rest of the stay (room wise) was just meh. 

check out; the hotel has a convenient method of checkout either on the television or through your mobile phone\/email but the guy at the front desk didnt delete the resort fees from my account so I have to get out of bed and go wait in line (friday morning when everyones checking in) and explain again that the room was crappy and we were promised no resort fees. guy takes care of it. again, nothing impressive i just had to ask twice for the same thing. 

go back to the room, get our stuff together and wait for the bell to come help with the luggage. he helps us load our stuff into the car. and we head over to the mgm to spend the day at their pool when i get out of my car i look driver side door and it is beat up! they scratched the paint and left marks from who knows what? shoes? it looks like they dragged a suit case into the car from the floor (see picture) and my car is new! and freshly washed just before getting to vegas i was so peeved. and i even tipped them! this is why i hate valet. my wife said we should go back and show them but i know how they would have responded. i really wish i would have gone back and made them pay for the damages.

then when we get to the mgm i wanted to lock the trunk since our baggage was in there while we were at the pool and the lock for teh trunk was damaged! i forgot my valet key at home so the valet had the real key that works for the trunk lock and they must have opened my trunk to see if i had anything of value in it. luckily i took everything out (laptop, jewelry, etc) just shows how classy this hotel is.

I got engaged February of 2013 and we set a wedding date for late June 2013.  

I am 6'0 and about a size 16 (I can flux depending on the style between a 14 and an 18).  I have previously been married and my first wedding dress needed NO ALTERATIONS.  As a high school student, I wore a 14 and modeled in bridal shows for local shops because they didn't have to alter their dresses to fit me.  I am tall but extremely proportionate, so I rarely need more than a hem dropped in pants, skirts or dresses. 

I made an appointment and brought seven friends with me. I met with Jill; not the owner Ann.  I found a dress that I liked but it was HUGE!  It stayed on with four clamps.  It was big and over my budget (about $1250.00) but it was available for purchase that day.  Allure Bridal 8809.  I later found the dress online for a fourth of my purchase price!  

Jill repeatedly advised me that a seamstress could take in any dress that was four sizes too big.  I should have thought it out, this dress was way more than four sizes too big.  I asked several times, are you sure this dress can be taken in?  I was repeatedly told that it would not be a problem.  I was actually given two recommendations for tailors.  

I believed her; though I had a weird feeling about it (you know the weird feeling Oprah tells you to pay attention to) but I knew I did not have time to order a dress.  I then went to pay for the dress and my debit card declined.  I thought this was weird and asked her to run it again.  It declined again.   My friend then charged it to her Am Ex no problem.  

I checked my bank account the next day, the dress had actually been charged to my checking account twice putting a hold on my account.  GREAT all that money locked up!  But that was just the start of the problem.

About two weeks after my purchase, I called and made an appointment with tailor Jenny Barnes (a Strut recommendation).  

Mid-May I went to Jenny.  I put the dress on or at least held it to my body.  Jenny looked at me and said, ""Who sold you this dress?""  I said I went to Strut, she said was it Ann?  I said no.  She said the dress was entirely too big and it never should have been sold to me.  Jenny said this to me on my first visit, to my mother on our second alterations appointment , again to me on the third alterations appointment and again to my friend who attended, YES, the fourth alteration appointment. 

It took Jenny four appointments and cost me $530.00 in alterations and I didn't even have a bustle put in.  Jenny did everything she could, but ultimately she couldn't size it completely because the dress would have lost its shape. 

I called Strut because I felt they should pay for the alterations.  I spoke with Ann who was initially gracious about the issue.  She told me she would contact Jenny, discuss the matter and call me back.

I then talked to Jenny who told me that Ann had threatened her and refused to send her any more business.   Jenny has been in busy for 20 plus years, she formally worked for Neiman Marcus.  She has a phenomenal reputation on Yelp.  

My wedding came and went... Jenny did what she could but the cup size was so big in the dress that I had to put four, yes four, athletics socks in the bust area.   
I gave Ann some additional time to call me back.   NO PHONE CALL.

I called today and Ann put the blame on Jenny and myself.  She said I had lost weight and that's why the dress was so big (I lost maybe 5 lbs and that doesn't show on my 6'0 frame).   She told me that if I was unhappy with Jenny, I should have gone to another tailor.  That Jenny told her that I wanted the dress to be tighter than Jenny could make it (are you kidding me, I had my friend pulling up the neckline before I walked down the aisle so the dress wouldn't slip down).   In other words she took absolutely no responsibility.  STRUT WILL DO ANYTHING TO SELL A DRESS! 

I am a proud supporter of local businesses - BUT NOT THIS ONE.  I expect professional, courtesy from a local business (I mean this isn't trashy David's Bridal).  If Ann had followed up with me and explained the situation or offered to contribute to the cost of the alterations, or offered a veil or other service I would not be writing this complaint.  DO NOT TRUST THEM, THEY WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING TO SELL A DRESS!",Beauty
FQSqCoPfurntyaAjNaXYzA,rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,_8VkSb_Mryb6bHQxSWB7Pg,2007-08-08,"I love the idea of shabu shabu cooking, whether it's fondue style for the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, or the French.  

After discovering Nina's has closed down (for now), the BF took me to Swish to satisfy this craving.  Walking into the restaurant, it's pretty straight forward how business is run here.  In front of every seat is a hot pot (or a hot pan) for your own cooking wishes.

The main two features of Swish is their shabu shabu menu and their sukiyaki menu.  

For shabu shabu, you get to cook your meat, seafood, or veggies in a broth.  (The menu says it's a seaweed broth, but it appears clear like water and I couldn't taste any seaweed in it.)  I ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size portion for $13.95.  They give you two dipping sauces, one is a ponzu type sauce and the other tasted like it had a peanut taste in it.  (Supposedly it's sesame though.)  They also give you a small dish of assorted veggies that include onions, carrots, green onions, tofu, mushrooms, spinach, and cabbage.  A small portion of two types of noodles and a bowl of rice are included with your shabu shabu order.  You can also request for shichimi (chili powder), layu (hot sesame oil), and chili paste for an additional kick.  It's a filling portion for the price you pay, and you can order additional rice or noodle for no extra charge.  (Double check on the noodle part though.)  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of shabu shabu.

The BF ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy Portion for $14.95.  They pour a bit of oil into your hot pan, and add a sauce where you pretty much grill your food into the sauce.  Throughout your meal, you'll add more grilling sauce to help cook your meal.  There's a bit more taste with the sukiyaki style, but shabu shabu would be considered healthier.  You also get the assorted vegetables, noodles, and bowl of rice with your sukiyaki order.  Be sure to ask for your raw egg too, you can either dip your food into it or pour it over your rice like the BF does.  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Chicken Fiesta, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of sukiyaki.

Other items on the menu include appetizers like kimchee, spinach sesame salad, seaweed salad, and spicy seafood salad.  For dessert, you can find ice cream, mochi, and Japanese steamed cheesecake.  A few bento options are available to go too!

Service was good, but I heard it could be better.  In the beginning of your cooking, they offer garlic, radish, and green onions to your sauce or cooking pan.  The BF mentioned that when he eats there, the waitresses often cook the food for them.  However, when we went, they didn't offer.  He wasn't sure if it was because he goes at lunch or because he's with other guys.  =)  Haha!

Overall, my experience at Swish was good.  At other shabu shabu places (like Koji's Japan in Orange, CA http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cqQHvz1zvM_z2MbH0zjXBA#hrid:xzHUpQinpow0nRqocXAB0w\/query:Koji),  they offer unlimited vegetables and a better dipping sauce.  Then again, Koji's is a bigger run operation than Swish.  I wish they would offer more vegetables though in their order.  

Look out for their specials!  When we went, they offered 25% off Kobe orders, 10% off with Student IDs, and a frequent eater card.  They're about to open another location on Silverado Range and Maryland Pkwy in the late fall.

Overall: 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.

Update! 10\/29\/07 - Over the weekend, the BF and I were craving some Swish.  I ordered the Kobe Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size ($35.95) and the BF order the Kobe Rib Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy size ($38.95).  The meat was so tender and oh so good.  I think the prices just went up and they no longer offer a frequent eater card.  But they do offer a group discount for five or more.  And reservations are accepted for parties of three or more too.  Only udon noodles were given to us this time, and the veggies are still on the skimpy side in my opinion.  The Kobe Rib Eye is pretty good stuff, but it's a costly thing!

(I added some pics of our dinner on the business profile section.)

Update! They apparently offer a happy hour from 9 pm to 10 pm.",Restaurant

Stripsteak meets those requirements, but does not differentiate itself from other steak houses enough to make the visit necessarily worth repeating.

I settled in with two of my companions on a Sat night with no reservations (always a worry) but the service was able to snag us a corner table.  Perfect.

The restaurant started us off with some complimentary duck fat fries with three dipping sauces (in-house ketchup, old bay, and truffled aioli).  I've never been able to taste a significant difference in duck fat fries vs regular fries, and this was no different, but let me assure you, those fries were very tasty.

American Bone-in Ribeye - An excellent peace of beef, cooked perfectly to medium rare.  While the price was a bit high for the size IMHO, it had a nice sear on the outside and was juicy\/flavorful throughout making it an enjoyable meal.  But true to my statement above, I've had great steaks before.  This is a great steak, but didn't stand out more than other great steaks I've had.  18oz bone in for $52.

Truffled mac and cheese - Again, very tasty mac and cheese, and the truffled flavor was excellent.  A strong choice, but not anything that is phenomenal or mind-blowing to speak of.  

Potato puree trio - Great concept: three types of flavored mashed potatos served side by side.  The lobster mashed had a few small chunks of lobster in it (so my companion told me, as I didn't get any lobster bites in the three spoonfuls I tried) and was interesting to taste.  The sour cream and onion was a pretty standard flavor, that probably could've used a slightly stronger seasoning as it tastes nearly plain compared to the other two.  The horseradish was easily the best tasting, and one of the standouts during dinner.  Something as simple as horseradish added to well made potato puree made it a really standout.  

Beingets with vanilla creme brulee - Crisp on the outside giving way to soft pillow interior, the beingets were fried perfectly with a dusting of sugar.  And the vanilla creme brulee provided a perfect sugar crust on top to crak, and had a perfectly smooth creme inside that made every bite enjoyable.  This dessert had great execution, and was delicious.

Finally, at the end of the meal, they provided two complimentary bags of peppered caramel popcorn to take home with us.  The popcorn was tasty, and the complimentary final note was a nice touch.  I enjoyed the popcorn about an hour later, and the texture had staled only sligthtly compared to freshly made, but it was a nice reminder of the meal we just had.

Verdict:  A very solid steak restaurant and worth checking out.  They attempt to differentiate by using wood to grill (thus infusing the flavor of the wood into the meat) but to be honest, I can't taste a significant difference.  Service was top notch, food was top notch, and the overall experience was great.  Would I be back?  Possibly, to enjoy a good meal, but having had the opportunity to eat at a lot of great steak places, it's hard to warrant traveling to Vegas and coming by here again when there are so many other options of great food to try.  Great experience!",Restaurant

The family wanted to go to that G-spot sushi but there was a ridiculous 1hour, 45minute wait at 8pm on a Friday night. It was up to me to find a different place. I haven't heard of the people who did the reviews for this place so I was a bit concerned how reliable they were. My sister called Doh to ask if there was a wait since she can sense my patience ran out.

We were greeted by friendly hostesses and got seated right away. Our table was in front of the piano. There was live music while we were eating! But the pianist took a break\/ went home by around 9pm.

The more I think about my experience, the more I like Doh. Last night I was telling myself, this place was not 5-star worthy and all the other reviews were shenanigans! I think I was just hANGRY for thinking that. I couldn't think of a single thing to complain about, well...maybe, the pork belly but our server did warn me about it though. 

This place serves AYCE sushi and Korean\/Japanese tapas for $26 and is ran by Korean chefs and there were maybe 4 of them when we went so our food came out pretty quick. There's a limit on the sashimi, uni and amaebi just like most AYCE places. They have beer, sake, soju and cocktails. Our server was great. He answered all our questions and kept our drink glasses full at all times. He was dealing with a tough crowd: me - the impatient and hungry one, my aunt - with her weird questions, my cousin who's on a strict Mr. Olympia diet, my uncle who was late and extremely hungry...my sis and my bro-in-law who were the semi-normal ones for the evening. We got okonomiyaki, galbi, bossam (steamed pork belly), Vegas toast, shrimp tempura, soft-shell crab tempura, Aria roll, Rock & Roll, Avocado Bomb, Popcorn Lobster, Something Wrong, Screaming O roll, Screaming O salmon sashimi, salmon nigiri, pepper tuna, uni and amaebi. The quality of the fish and seafood was amazing. For dessert, we got a Banana Dream (banana tempura served with green tea ice cream) and a plum wine ice cream. My favorites were uni, amaebi, Screaming O salmon sashimi, and salmon nigiri but here are some remarkable menu items I tried:

Soft-Shell Crab Tempura:
There's a newer AYCE sushi place on Maryland Parkway and Flamingo that starts with an S that served (all in the past for them now) great soft-shell crab but I was sooo disappointed the last time I went. Doh's soft-shell crab was breaded lightly and the dipping sauce was a bit spicier than most places. I definitely enjoyed this. 5\/5

Vegas Toast:
Breaded and deep-fried ham and cheese roll (no rice). The cheese was oozingly melted. 5\/5

Okonomiyaki:
I thought I already posted a pic before I deleted all the pics but I guess not. Fail! Squid and veggie pancake with katsu sauce, catsup and bonito flakes on top. I screwed up ordering this and I was the only one interested eating it - not because it wasn't good but because it was too heavy and filling. This is not for everybody though especially if you're not familiar with takoyaki and okonomiyaki. I liked it. 5\/5

Bossam:
And now, for the ""bad"". Steamed pork belly. This is how it's supposed to be prepared though so, our bad for only reading the ""pork belly"" part expecting marinated and grilled pork belly. This comes with onions and an oyster with gochujang. So since this is indeed bossam and not grilled pork belly this is 4\/5.",Restaurant

This family owned restaurant in a strip mall at the northeast corner of Desert Inn and Pecos Road where ironically McDonald's is a landmark serves as time machine that delivers people back to the rock around the 50's. As soon as you step inside the 50's Diner you are transported back to a decade where Elvis Presley was the king of the airwaves, The Honeymooners were on the air, Fremont Street was a shopping destination and Thunderbirds cruised along Durango Drive. Oops! Durango Drive was built about thirty years later.

   This looks exactly like a 50's diner. The color scheme is pink and red. The pink dominates the walls, counter, and gumball machine. Hanging on the pink walls are 50's memorbelia. The red dominates the booths and chairs. Complimenting the 50's atmosphere is a jukebox that plays the rocking oldies.

   The 50's Diner is more than 50% breakfast. Breakfast is a major part of its business. It is actually called Omelet House 50's Diner. Years ago, but not as far back as the 50's, it was owned by the people that own the local breakfast favorite Omelet House. The Omelet House influence permeates the menu. Nearly every entrée includes the choice of spuds. There is nearly a whole menu page dedicated to omelets. I counted 34. There is a horizontal menu section featuring breakfast specials that start off at $4.49 on weekends and $5.49 on weekends. Two of my three visits back to the 50's, I'd have breakfast.

   On my first visit, I ordered the $4.49 two eggs special. The plate featured two scrambled eggs, two slices of bacon, spuds, & toast. The food was good for the money. When it comes to scrambled eggs, in my book Coo Coo's Cafe in downtown Henderson is currently the champion.

  Visit two I ordered the egg salad sandwich with spuds. It was served on toasted bread with a tomato. It was a good sandwich. When it comes to egg salad sandwiches, in my opinion, Bagel Cafe is the current king. Both times the coffee was Starbuck's competitive and often topped off.

  On visit three, I tried their cheeseburger. It seems that 50's Diner extended their hours from closing at 3 to 9. There are dinner choices on the menu. It was during brunch hours that I ordered the cheeseburger that came with fries and costed $6.79 before the Coke. I didn't have to order French fries. I could of asked for soup, spuds, or salad. If Fonzie of the 50's themed ""Happy Days"" was eating this burger in Arnold's, I am confident he'd give it a thumbs up. It wasn't gimmicky. Just delicious. This is one of the juiciest cheeseburgers that I have had in recent times. The 6 ounce medium done cheeseburger was covered with thick melting American cheese. A delicious touch of tomatoes, onions, and lettuce caused me to enjoy every bite to the sounds of the oldies.

   50's Diner might be the dining experience of the future for Las Vegas. In the northeast, especially metropolitan New York City, diners are extremely popular. They are usually family owned restaurants that are open long hours and serve people a large variety of items throughout the day. They are similar to cafes but usually by themselves. Regardless, the 50's Diner will most likely be visited again in my future. They serve good food at reasonable prices in a restaurant thats bring me back to the 50's oldies when my parents were teenagers, Ed Sullivan was popular , and Thunderbirds cruised Las Vegas Boulevard in the shadow of the Sands, Frontier, and Riviera.",Restaurant

Yes similar to your cell phone provider, I too have realized that getting others to deal with your headache for small fee, may just be the way of the future. 

Seems like everyone has a crazy friend who will torture their hands and brain to put your Swedish crap together. Generally the chart goes as follows:

One item: A big thank you and a high five if it took no time at all.

Two items: A case of beer... you want Mill Street Organic you say? No problem... I got your back.

Three items: Beer and Pizza. I'll even order from Pizza Hut and get the crust stuffed if that will make this assembly more bearable.

Four or more items: I'll bring the shovel, you tell me where the body is stashed... don't ask don't tell right?!

If you are not this lucky invite some unsuspecting friends over and SURPRISE, you get to put together the furniture you'll be sitting on... Doesn't that sound like fun?!

ANYWAYS... I bought the world's ugliest bookshelf here last summer. She was a limited edition massive Billy Bookcase that was clearly conceived in a haze of acid and once too many meatball servings. It's white with odd scribbles and stamp doodles in various colours. At first I thought it was a bookcase travesty and than it grew on me (or more like the 14.99$ price tag for a $99 bookshelf swayed me).

Fast forward almost a year later and that thing was still sitting in the corner of my apartment un-opened and waiting for a drunken assembling team. I called a few co-workers over to assist (AKA do all the work while I mix cocktails). Upon opening the flat cardboard box, we discovered I had none of the required hardware... no dowels, screws, nails, not ever a stupid allen key for pete's sake!

I re-grouped and consulted my many Ikea connoisseur friends who told me I could buy a kit to assemble my bookshelf... so much for $14.99. The best part is that this must be purchased at the dreaded Return Counter. I've heard stories of friends going in for a missing piece and going missing themselves... doomed to be ground up into Lack table dust none the less...

I showed up at 10:34am on a bright Wednesday morning to said location. I had on my Yelp sweat bands and was ready for the long wait and series of stupid customer service questions. To my surprise the whole ordeal went quite smoothly. After fiddling with the automated ticket machine, I received my number and was called up to the desk within 10 mins. I explained that I wanted to buy a kit for my Billy bookcase which came with no hardware (and since it was a year old I did not have the receipt). 

Turns out they don't sell these kits or at least they didn't have any. I made a frowny face and prepared to admit defeat when the service lady said she would do the impossible... she would manually assemble a kit for me of the 5693 pieces needed to put my bookshelf together. If it weren't for her ugly Blue and Yellow uniform I might have thrown myself over the counter and kissed her (but I have standards and kept composure). This woman was my knight and shining armour as she swooped from bin to bin comparing 'thing-a-ma-doo-hickies' to 'whatcha-ma-call-its' bitting her lip in frustration and using her bullshit assembly manual to select the right quantities. She pushes the hair from her face and wipes the sweat from her brow, hands me my bag of Ikea bling and wishes me a good day. Yes indeed that was a good day!!",Shopping

My experience was similar to many of the other 1-star reviews here. I hope that by spending the time to write this review I'm able to save someone else the unneeded nightmare of dealing with such an unscrupulous and rude business. If you love your new baby and don't need stress added to your pregnancy, don't shop here!

On July 3, 2012, I was looking for a store selling the Origami stroller because I wanted to see it in person. I called USA Baby Child Space and the lady on the phone said that they had it in the store and said I could come in anytime. Within the hour I was at the store and when I couldn't find the stroller, I asked a salesperson where I could find it and was told they didn't keep it in stock. I told her that I'd just called and was told it was in the store, and the lady looked surprised and said, ""oh we just sold it."" I thought this was strange, but didn't know anything about the store at the time, so I believed her.

I ended up spending $3,600 including ordering the stroller sight-unseen. I also purchased a matching crib and dresser. The items were to be delivered ""in a couple of weeks."" I also paid an additional fee for delivery and for assembly.

On July 29, 2012 (not too late), they arrived at our home with the items. The stroller was fine, but when they brought the dresser in, my husband said that he noticed that it was bowing like it was made of rubber. When the delivery men left the room, I attempted to show my husband how the top of the dresser becomes a table by pulling out the top, but something wasn't right - it was sticking and crooked. My husband pointed out that one of the wheels was missing from the bottom corner of the dresser leg. 

Then I started to open the drawers. When I opened the top drawer, a screw fell to the floor with a ""clack"" on the wood floor. When I opened the second drawer, two more screws. When the delivery men came back in, we pointed this out to them. They opened the drawers and more screws fell, then on the last one, some splintered wood fell to the floor along with one of the metal guide rails. (We kept pictures of this.) 

We called the store and spoke with the manager ""Evelyn"" and explained the situation. She pressed REALLY hard to get us to keep the ""furniture"" until a replacement could be delivered. My husband said that the dresser was a hazard and we didn't want it on our property where a baby was going to be, so they took the dresser and crib back. I asked Evelyn when we would receive a replacement and she said she would call me the following Monday with an update because there was nothing she could do on a Saturday. 

On Monday (surprise!) no one called me back! I called them Tuesday and reached Evelyn who told she couldn't give me any information, to wait, and that she would ""call [me] tomorrow."" Nobody called me Wednesday. I called them Thursday around 4 but Evelyn was ""busy."" I told them that I would like to get my money back if they wouldn't provide me with an approximate date it would arrive. They told me that Evelyn would call me back on that. She called around 5.30 p.m and I asked what the status on the furniture was and why she didn't call when she promised. Evelyn started (literally) SCREAMING at me the whole conversation and if you can picture this, she literally screamed that dresser won't be here next week either, that she didn't know when it will arrive and that she wouldn't give me a date, but that the was ""working on it."" 

I told her that since she couldn't even provide an approximate delivery date and because I no longer had time to keep trying to track her down (or felt like being screamed at by a crazy person for that matter), I told her I couldn't wait and that I wanted a refund. 

She started screaming at me again saying they wouldn't give me my money back. I told her not to scream at me anymore since we have been good customers who spent over $3,500 at their store. She replied (again screaming) ""I'm not screaming at you. You don't understand you need to listen I already told you I'm working on it."" I appreciated the irony of her screaming that she wasn't screaming at me.  

When asked if I could speak to another manager or just someone who wouldn't scream at me the whole time Evelyn replied, ""I'm the highest person at the store and there are no other managers.""

I let Evelyn know that I would be disputing the dresser\/crib portion of the charge because I spent a lot of money in this store on what I thought was quality new furniture for our baby girl, I was 6 months pregnant and very upset. What should have been a joy for our family ended up being a headache with a crazy person screaming at me.

Only after opening a chargeback with my credit card company for the dresser\/crib portion of my order, did I IMMEDIATELY get a call from USA Baby saying that the items I was previously told would be impossible to get quickly were magically ready for delivery.",Shopping
TPzrg3fHi7tUqb7GWWfi9A,yaWnpONXlvdXbi36aKcznw,hTxTFpCT4PnC553nUbM4kw,2012-07-16,"I had a generally decent experience with Canadian Appliance Source. I had to purchase a bunch of new appliances for my home renovation project, and like any smart consumer I extensively researched both the reviews of the brands\/models and store prices.
I have found that buying major appliances is a major pain in the butt, especially if you are not shopping for the super high-end stuff. Selection is often not that great and not all of the models you are looking for are available at different stores so that you can shop around and compare.  

From my research I ended up getting my washer & dryer from the Brick because I took advantage of their a big Maytag promotion in addition to their 10% off discount when used with a HD credit card. That left with the dishwasher and an over-the-range microwave unit which I ended up purchasing at Canadian Appliance Source

If you are going to shop here I strongly suggest going to their website first. Their website show you the most current prices and what is in stock. I had a list written down of my top 3 or 4 choices of models that they carried and when I got to the store most of the items were either not in the showroom or not in stock.
Their showroom is rather disorganized and the appliances are not grouped by type or brand which forces you to run around the store many times over to find what you are looking for or make comparisons.

The sales person was friendly and was trying to help me as much as I could, however he was also helping a couple other customers at the same time and he wasn't that good at multi-tasking -- he would suddenly appear or disappear out of nowhere. Luckily my iPhone was a valuable tool when I was in the showroom as I was on their website comparing specs and seeing what was actually in stock. I found my smartphone to be much more helpful than the salesperson in the store, which I rather do at my own pace than to chase or wait after the sales staff. The salesperson mentioned that any of the items that have express delivery option on their website are in stock, which helped in the selection process, too bad I didn't know this ahead of time. 

Just to note that some of the prices they have posted in the store is not correct, as I found a microwave that was supposedly on sale at a great price, but the salesperson said that they didn't have the chance to change the price and said that the website price is the most current, unfortunately it was $100 more, which I thought it was a bit of a bait and switch if you haven't shopped on their website prior -- and they didn't even take the minute to take the price tag off or change it when it was brought to their attention.   
Also search the retail prices as I found some of the retail prices on their site to be a bit inflated or out-of-date, again a bit deceptive on their part. My iPhone was also helpful here as I was able to go to the Brick's and Leon's websites to compare both retail and sales prices.

My two hours spent in the store only got as far as deciding on a dishwasher, which I got a nice Bosch at a good discount and made the purchase there. I couldn't decide on a microwave and wanted to go home and research more online on the models they have in stock. The salesperson said that I could call later and add it later to my order and schedule delivery as the delivery fee applies to each trip, not by quantity. I'm glad I did because I found the Samsung models that they were pushing and remarked that had good ratings had actually consistantly poor consumer reviews and defects with their digital controls.
I ended up getting a Frigidaire Professional Series microwave which they had at a deep discount and as a bonus it matches my gas range.

I bought the dishwasher in store on Sunday and called in to order the microwave on Monday and they managed to deliver both items to my downtown condo on Tuesday afternoon, which I was really impressed. Their delivery guys were also great as my loading dock was blocked by another truck so one of the guys managed to move both items at once around the truck and lifted the items on to the dock himself. He proceeded to move the items directly into my unit quickly and with care, all the while being very friendly and courteous.

I would recommend shopping here if you are willing to do the homework, but I can't say this store is any better or worse than other appliance stores or outlets.",Shopping
dw7D60ZfsoTMvk8gADI5Ew,Vsd7ptZg6evQZYPYQprgag,z0z1KF6wyAALOtMBOp00qg,2015-12-21,"One thing that has always irritated me about people in any position of ""authority"" is when they make it a point to ""throw their weight around"" & somehow get to a place where their inflated ego causes them to believe that they cannot be replaced. Unfortunately this location suffers from this type of disease, as I learned early this morning. There was an ""over-the-counter"" healthcare item that I needed to purchase & I called in to confirm that it was in stock (nobody wants to drive all the way to a Walgreens at 4AM just to find out that the item they need is sold out). Once I confirmed that they had it in stock, I headed to this store. Upon my arrival, I went to the aisle that the item is normally stocked in & none were left. This was puzzling as I called in to the pharmacy beforehand & confirmed that it was in stock. At this point I went to the pharmacy & came upon a woman standing at the counter with this huge stack of papers in front of her. There was ONE guy working behind the counter (all by himself) & as I looked behind him I noticed an additional stock of the item I needed to purchase (which oddly had not been re-stocked on the normal store shelves). Rather than be rude & interrupt the transaction, I decided to wait. Well one minute turned in to 5, 5 turned into 10 & in consideration of the neighborhood & the fact that there's weird\/seedy people floating around outside at these hours, I didn't want to be in there all day waiting for this woman to get done. 

At this point, I went up front in hopes of asking the cashier to assist me in grabbing the ""over-the-counter"" item from behind the counter so that I can purchase it up front while the gentleman behind the pharmacy counter finished his transaction: Nobody was behind the front register once I got there & the guy who eventually walked back there looked nowhere close to being an employee judging by his wardrobe (I saw no name badge & no Walgreens apparel). He was just floating around the front part of the store, stopping to stand almost like the was lost in a daze... While I found this somewhat strange, I looked past it & asked if he could assist me in getting my OVER-THE-COUNTER item as I was on a tight schedule & the guy behind the pharmacy counter was tied up. He calls a ""manager"" over the speaker & a couple minutes later this ""manager"" walks up front. The employee tells him whats going on & the ""manager"" tells me that the guy behind the pharmacy counter can help me. I proceed to tell him that he's helping another customer with a lengthy transaction & i'm on a tight schedule. He then stated that he couldn't help me with anything behind the pharmacy (which I think was simply his way of saying that he just didn't feel like walking back there)... I re-advised him that the item in question was OVER THE COUNTER but they simply had the remaining stock behind the pharmacy counter (for whatever dumb reason) & the ONE guy working behind the pharmacy counter was in the middle of a lengthy transaction. The ""manager"" continued to be difficult, refusing to walk the few paces that would be required to get behind the pharmacy counter & grab this small little item that should have been re-stocked on the NORMAL store shelves (had somebody actually been doing their job). It was almost as if he was Hell-bent on being a complete d-bag today. Rather than do what I wanted to do (aka- punch him in his mouth for being such a d-bag), I said ""ok"", gave him that ""I should really punch you in your mouth"" look & walked back to the pharmacy counter only to see an empty register. 5-10 minutes later the gentleman behind the pharmacy counter re-appears from somewhere in the back & I checked out. In the end, I came in an EMPTY store yet waited about 20 minutes just to get an OVER THE COUNTER ITEM that likely would have taken me less than TWO MINUTES to purchase had the store simply re-stocked the item over the counter. 

My question is this: How difficult would it be for you to walk your lazy self back behind the pharmacy counter (while your ONLY pharmacy employee is clearly tied up with another transaction) & grab an item in order to help a customer who has clearly stressed the fact that he is on a tight schedule? Doing so would be good customer service, any idiot knows that, & if your ego is that big where you are unwilling to go above & beyond for the customer then you don't need to be in a ""management"" position because you're definitely not made for it... Why am I so upset? The way I see it, i'm paying you to be an a-hole & I have a SERIOUS problem with that, as should anyone who has been a customer at Walgreens for as long as I have (aka- all their life, ever since you were in diapers)... I don't know his name & honestly don't care what it is, but prayerfully they replace him because he's obnoxious, he clearly knows nothing about good customer service & his unwillingness to assist the customer with something so basic makes a very poor reflection on the entire Walgreens brand.",Beauty
a9DBnxkUsMkEc0ZvVf4Ogw,MzZAOpNSJ1uHyKxMkswTag,Fy48HyITu3HxF7_VYhEnLw,2016-10-19,"This review is specifically for the clinic located in the pharmacy. Let me just say right off the bat that I was thoroughly impressed with the clinic!  I happen to be in the middle of relocating to the area from Colorado and I caught a really nasty cold\/virus that has been going around (likely as a result of the stress of the move and new job).  I didn't go into Walgreens with the intent on going to the clinic but rather I was looking to find something that might help me breath a bit better as I was finding it difficult to take good, deep breaths without hacking my brains out and\/or feeling out of breath with even the slightest activity. With that said, I noticed the clinic and thought it would probably be a good idea to be seen if possible. I used their easy registration kiosk\/computer to set myself up for a walk in appointment (there are options to schedule an appointment also). There was only one person ahead of me so figured it likely wouldn't take too long and I was right. I waited for about 20 minutes which I thought was totally reasonable for a walk-in. I saw Jenny who is an NP (Nurse Practitioner) and she was awesome!  I definitely made the right choice to be seen because my pulse oximetry (Oxygen level) was quite low and Jenny was rightly concerned about that. She immediately gave me a Breathing Treatment and talk about night and day in terms of how I felt. My Oxygen level came up to where it needed to be during the treatment and while obviously I was still sick, I felt much better. Jenny spent a good 30 minutes or so with me and it didn't feel rushed at all (regular Dr might have spent 5-10 min tops). Jenny certainly showed that she cared about my health and I guess I just didn't expect that in the clinic setting. The main reason I am writing this review is because I never really thought about using a clinic like this one before and to be honest, were it not for the fact that I am new to the area, I likely wouldn't have this time but I am sure glad I did!!  I wish that I knew about the convenience of this option before and will be singing the praises of this clinic anytime someone I know has an illness that isn't critical or a true emergency. To be clear, do NOT go to this clinic if you think you may be having a heart attack  or some other life threatening emergency. GO TO THE ER AT A HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY!!  Also important to note, this office doesn't have the ability to do X-rays or sutures\/stitches so you would need to go to the ER or possibly Urgent Care (which is a bit of a bummer and the only reason I rated 4 instead of 5)
To summarize this somewhat lengthy review, for their intended purpose, this clinic is awesome and I will be utilizing them again in the future for basic healthcare needs. Jenny deserves a special shout out for really doing an excellent and taking the necessary time with me and caring about me!  I did also receive a call from the manager of the clinic with about 48 hours after my visit. She was checking on me to see how I was doing. 
One note, it is awesome that the clinic can transfer prescriptions electronically right to the pharmacy but I will mention to make sure you get what you are supposed to from the pharmacy. The NP specifically prescribed a device that she wanted me to use with the inhaler she prescribed (I saw it written in script) but the pharmacy didn't include it. Luckily before I left the store, I noticed it wasn't there. When I went back to the pharmacy counter, a fairly rude employee  (don't know if Tech or Pharmacist) said that the device doesn't come with the medication. I don't know why they would just ignore the instruction and not even speak to me about it. I stated that I needed to get one anyway and a pharmacist then walked over and I believe in an attempt to back up the other guy, stated the device ""must be prescribed"" and I told him it was, please go back and look at prescription. He did and immediately changed his demeanor and became helpful. He did go out of his way to help find a reasonable option because I had to pay cash for it and I did appreciate that. It was just disappointing that had I not known that I needed it and\/or fully understood the PA's instruction on how to take my medications, I would not have gotten the needed device. Anyway, I am NOT factoring this into my review because it has nothing g to do with the clinic.",Shopping

Only reason I'm rounding up to 4 stars instead of giving just 3 stars is because I truly think Lissa is great! There were some minor things that could have been better with the manicure itself, but there was something else (another person at the salon, outside of Lissa's control) that soured my experience.

Lissa did my SNS manicure and was very sweet and genial. I had to reschedule one day, and she was very accommodating. The salon itself just opened in August was very clean and well-appointed. I chose to have an SNS manicure. Another awesome thing about Lissa is she let me text her Pinterest pictures and was able to give me an exact quote, and it's always nice to know exactly how much you're paying upfront! I adore SNS dip powder, but unfortunately the color I wanted wasn't available. So Lissa cleverly suggested she do a couple coats of the dip powder to strengthen the nails and achieve durability, and then use gel to impart the color! I liked that idea. She is also adept when it comes to ""bling"" or design! 

The owner was there as well, and she was incredibly nice and welcoming. I liked that she seemed very hands-on. I do have a few suggestions where I feel there is room for improvement, however:
(1) I realized that night after I left that I paid for a ""manicure,"" which usually involves at least some lotion and a quick hand\/arm massage, but I didn't receive lotion or a massage. I thought that was odd. I've never had a manicure without lotion and massage. It might have been because another lady arrived and maybe she forgot. I don't know. 
(2) I mentioned I hadn't gotten my nails done in months and my cuticles weren't looking too hot, so I thought the cuticles would get special attention, but they still appear dry and not ""tidy"" enough, if that makes sense. You can see what I mean from the picture. 
(3) What really started to irk me toward the end was the presence of who I learned was also an employee at the salon - a girl who sat next to us during my manicure. I first thought she was maybe someone's daughter just hanging out. I found it... odd that she kept talking and talking, but I tried to be nice and chit chat. But I'd had a very long day and after a while, I really wasn't in the mood to listen to her talk to Lissa about how she collects jars of pig fetuses, employee politics and have her show me pictures of her pet opossum... At first it was cute, but after a while I just needed peace and quiet. Some people go to the nail salon to relax and she was quite hyper. I own a business myself and I never let my customers overhear personal, inner-workings amongst employees. It was just too much. I tolerated it, but at one point I *believe* this young lady even made a rude remark about my father who was walking around just outside the salon. She clearly didn't know that was my father. Needless to say, I did NOT appreciate that. She really wore my patience thin by that point. I know that the salon is relatively new and this girl was young, so perhaps she did not understand how a customer could be offended or feel that her behavior is inappropriate, but I think she should mind herself and her tongue next time a customer comes in. I want to note that despite this girl's behavior, Lissa herself was very professional though and I still tipped her 20%. 

After everything, my nails did last me through an entire bachelorette weekend in Vegas and are still holding strong! I just hope that my constructive criticism about the other issues be taken to heart, because I feel that with just a little work, this salon could be top-notch. Thanks!",Beauty
A7JgjKKBkVwJWKNRhTiCQg,5M0CbwDAfucl1UaP0-AcPQ,Az_60nNuh1FH8Ds8oasZjw,2016-03-15,"The place is beautiful....fancy....expensive...just what you want when staying in one of the high end hotels on the strip....BUT... THE NOISE ISSUE AT NIGHT IS A FACT!

I like to consider reviews on Yelp to be a way for future visitors to prepare for their stay...SO FAIR WARNING:  You may have read several reviews talk about the nightclub noise that lasts until 4am....it is 100% true and happened every night we were there.

We were on the 51st floor (!) facing the strip and each night...right up to 4am....there was a thumping coming from the clubs (either XS or the Beach Club one...whichever is running that night).   I had ear plugs so it didn't bother me....but if I were on Business or in a lower floor, it would drive me absolutely crazy considering how much they charge for rooms.

Don't bother calling the desk....this is normal for the hotel.  I imagine that long ago they considered the balance between the money they get for the clubs v. the inconvenience to their guests and decided it was worth it to allow the noise to continue unabated.  The issue is that both clubs have an open air component that expose the noise to the outside (pool areas) and those both face the hotel.

Bottom line:  Get a room that faces AWAY from the strip and towards downtown\/Fremont St to avoid this.....or get ear plugs (good ones) or stay in the penthouse floors and drink heavily.

Putting the noise aside.....this is a beautiful place with beautiful people paying beautiful sums to be among beautiful things.  If you want an idea of the have v. have nots, visit Fremont Street at night....it will make you appreciate what you pay for in order to stay at the Encore.

Security is everywhere....and I mean thick with folks in purple coats with earpieces.  Good example: There are 2 Jeff Koons exhibits (tulips and popeye) that are beautiful works of art....and have a Security sentinel posted 24\/7 next to each.  That's all that person does....watch the display.  This is in addition to the security you see just about everywhere you go....and I mean everywhere....all the time.  We were guests so we felt very safe and welcomed the layer of safety that you don't get just wandering the strip.  An example of the attention was at the pool where we had brought our own plastic cup that looked very much like it was made of glass.  The 1st day we were there we were advised (politely) by no less than 6 different employees that there was no glass allowed in the pool area.  We let each know it was plastic and they let us be....but it became comical after a while.  Speaking of the pool....

TIPS:  The main pool area can get crowded....there's another ""European pool"" (over 21 only) right next to it that was completely empty our 1st day (literally, we were the only ones there) and had less than 10 people there each of the other days we went.

There's a café just as you get to the Wynn side of the resort from the Encore that serves as good and inexpensive a breakfast\/lunch as you will find on the property.  It's just across from the show\/will call area and about 100 feet from the big tulips display near the show entrances.  Not super duper cheap but you can get breakfast for 2 for less than $20 which, trust me, is a find.

UBER began servicing the area within the last year and picks up in the main valet area; it is very plentiful....EXCEPT between 10pm - 2am when the club traffic picks up.  

We had a package that got us into Le Reve for free.....a great Cirque show that shouldn't be missed if you need something to do.  The buffet was also comp'd and had some really terrific offerings.  

For the casual Vegas visitor it's my impression that there are 3 levels of experience you can have depending on your budget:
Low end = Fremont Street (it doesn't get much lower than there....don't even think of bringing your kids there).  
Middle = West or east ends of the strip....your Circus Circus\/Excaliber\/Luxor experiences.  You can absolutely find a deal for under $100\/night and so long as your room is just a place to crash, you're good to go.
High end = The Encore\/Wynn\/Bellagio\/Cosmo experience.  You will pay for it but the people are prettier, security is better and the place smells better (I kid you not).

To wrap it up: If you have the money and want to be among others that also have money and be in a place where money is no object....this is a really great hotel..... exactly what you'd expect from a high end 5 star Vegas resort hotel..... Steve Wynn has a great place here.

....just be careful of where your room is and be ready with ear plugs.",Shopping
ajoLEFnVhCJhD7oxyTKPIA,vLUHU5KxoB_CzLSHLkwz-g,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2014-12-19,"I decided after my finals this semester to do a staycation on the Strip because I've never stayed at a hotel on the Strip before. I chose Vdara because the price was relatively cheap compared to the other hotels and had what I wanted which was a large tub for me to soak in. Vdara is also smoke-free and without a casino, though Aria is in walking distance if you want either option. There is also free wifi for guests (included in resort fees). You just have to put in your last name and room number. It worked great when I was streaming Netflix.

I had to look up how to get to Vdara because I had never been there before and the map and directions were on the website. Turn left on Harmon if you're coming in from the south then follow the signs to the hotel. It can get a little confusing, but I managed. Vdara only has valet parking, but it's complimentary and that's what I did with my car. From the valet to the front desk, everyone was very friendly and enthusiastic. The person at the front desk was efficient checking me in and asked if I wanted a room on a low floor or high floor. I wanted high for the view and got a room on the 50th floor.

The room itself was huge and had a mini fridge as well as a kitchenette if I wanted to cook (I didn't, but always good to have). The window shades are controlled by a remote that is on the wall between the kitchen and the bedroom. The view? Amazing. My room was located where I could see the south end of the Strip.

I had always wanted to order room service and decided this was the time to do it. I ordered Organic Airline Chicken and two sides: Mushroom and Herb Risotto and Sauteed Spinach. It took about half an hour to arrive and when it did, the person who brought it was friendly. She came into the room and placed my food on the table in the kitchen along with a flower vase. At first glance, I thought ""Oh no, the chicken is smaller than the sides it came with!"" However, I couldn't even finish my meal and had to save it for the next day. Both the spinach and risotto were delicious, no complaints, but the chicken, while crispy and yummy, was just a tad on the side of salty. Still good though.

Bonus: As a Vdara guest, I was offered a 40% discount to watch the cirque de soleil show Ka. I've been wanting to watch a cirque de soleil show since forever because I've never been to one before, but I especially wanted to watch Ka. You bet your butt that I jumped on this deal and I was not disappointed.

I loved everything about my room and this hotel, from the large tub to the people working here. There were two minor things that I didn't like, but didn't really detract from my experience. One was that, because I had a room on the higher floors, I had to take those super fast elevators that my ears did not appreciate whatsoever. Also on my second day, I had gone out to eat breakfast and lunch, but housekeeping never showed up in my room. That was fine. However, when I went to watch Ka at MGM Grand late in the afternoon and came back, I was disoriented because I couldn't turn on the lights (housekeeping had turned off the lights using the master switch which I didn't use) and everything was cleaned up. Including my makeup on the bathroom counter which got organized. I honestly didn't expect housekeeping to show up so late in the day and it wasn't a nice surprise because I wasn't expecting it.

If I ever decide to do another staycation, Vdara is definitely a hotel reservation option. Love this place!",Beauty
d5cr3tnZqXfuz1Lb2mAi7w,omo7iYLYh_V9xVCc8Ic9JQ,VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ,2012-10-14,"In an effort to cure our weekend blues - the hubby devised a new plan.  Instead of staring @ each other all weekend we alternate weekends and plan something for us to do.  Budget of $100.   No complaining!   

This was his weekend.  I'm one of those wives that loves a surprise\/hates a surprise.  With that in mind I had great anxiety over the adventure ahead of me.  We start off with major construction going on our off ramp.  So we got a little side tracked and wound up going through some stranger parts of Phoenix.  I couldn't imagine a restaurant here so I was really starting to wonder what he had planned.  Then all of a sudden closer to the freeway there it is.  The most glorious signage I had ever seen.  Bobby Q's.  Fantastic.  He's gonna feed me and then the night will really begin. 

We head into the restaurant and everything is so cute.  It helped so much that tonight we could finally WANT to eat outdoors if we wanted to.  It's so much cooler.  We were told that it would be about five minutes.  We turned around, sat down and then our names were called.  Not bad.  I immediately notice the comfy little love seats and some of the tables.  We were not lucky enough to grab one of them but next time I tell you, my butt will be in one of them, or outside.  Tiffany came over and explained everything.  Which was great.  I love when wait staff knows their shit.  As a diet coke fanatic I will gladly let it pass that the competition is served in their restaurant.  I oped for the peach iced tea and had four more glasses after that.  At $1.75 how can you beat that.  And its not artificial tasting at all.  This was good.  Hubby had a beer that was specifically made for the restaurant.  BBQ Amber.  Good.  Went well with the meat.  Tiffany (who in my opinion is the epitome of what a wait person should be) immediately brought us some corn bread (to hold us over) and it was so good.  So GOOD.  I frosted mine like a mini cake with that butter and was all over it.  YUM.  When we put our drink order in we put an order for the Q-rolls in.  Before I was done with my first glass of iced tea - the appy was out. Think a smaller version of a taquito with beef brisket inside.  So awesome.  Good, just good!  I ordered the three meat combo (go big or go home) chicken, brisket and baby back ribs.  Chose mashed potatoes and corn as my sides.  Done and done.  Pic to follow.  I picked up a rib and it looked like the flintstone quarry.  Clean.  Not a lick of meat on it.  Where was the meat?  Oh on my plate.  It slid right off.  Not a touch of fat anywhere on it.  Melted on my mouth and was so good I was having trouble sharing.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The chicken with a touch of the spicy bbq sauce was run out on to the freeway and play good.  DELISH!  Do you get what I'm telling you here?  Hubby's meal was just as good.  Mac and cheese was great.  The corn.  O EM GEE the corn.  The little corn coins.  So cute and so damn good.  More peach iced tea.  At some point hubby used the term ""meat mayonaisse"" to describe the ribs.   He says that the fat on the ribs (which was minimal) melted in his mouth.  

The manager came over to check on us and what a doll she is.  I'm so mad that we didn't get her name.  Dear Manager - thank you again for the delish meal, the unexpected treat after and the great time we had on our date.  We will bring everyone we know there, we will suggest to everyone that they go there.  It was a real treat.  

To summarize - great place, great drinks, great service, great food, great manager, great dessert.  It will be our go to restaurant.",Restaurant
R3yZGhQj93_ch6RFm4pwhw,A7wnT-R8IGJmGLWKSrbwbQ,713qzYFUK00yxwRyxsPt7Q,2016-06-20,"This place can be hit or miss on service and I never know what to expect. On most visits, it has been outstanding. The following week, however, and it's average. The space, indoor and out, is fun and welcoming with a vibe that creates a good environment. It can be breezy and cold near the door so keep that in mind during the winter. The burgers are excellent as are most of the other main items. The starters are also good with no obvious let downs. I've been here over a dozen times every year since they've opened and I've never had food that I didn't like. The selection of bourbons is stellar, as are the beer choices. It's not uncommon for them to be out of certain varieties, however, which can be annoying if you don't have a second (or third, on one occasion) choice in mind. 

Other than some inconsistent service, I only have one other criticism.  However, it is significant enough that I will never recommend Bar 145 to others or return unless invited by someone else. I've been in sales for 20 plus years and have dined across the country in hundreds of establishments, from the lowest to the highest end, and I've never encountered anything like Bar 145's policy.  The first time I encountered it was a family dinner with a dozen people that had ordered appetizers and drinks in addition to our entrees.  I mention this because I believe context is important in assessing the policy.  When I received my duck confit salad, I didn't see any duck. After some digging, I found 4 or 5 small pieces; barely enough to qualify the salad as it name suggests. When I pointed this out to my server she said she would talk to the kitchen. When she returned, she informed me that the chef said I could have additional duck but at a charge of $1.00. I declined the ""offer"" to pay more to fix the problem. The salad was ok but would have been much better with the proper balance of protein to greens. In all of my years of dining out I've never encountered an establishment that wants to charge you more in response to a legitimate criticism regarding their dish. In retrospect, I should have sent the food back and declined to pay but given the nature of our visit (my birthday) it didn't seem like the thing to do, especially over a $1. But why was I, as a customer, put in that position, over a $1?  Why would a restaurant add $1 on a bill that exceeded $200 in response to a complaint? Why did the server have to ""check with the kitchen""?  Regardless, I chalked it up to an anomaly and moved on. 

Several months later, I met a client at Bar 145 after work for drinks and food. After a round, we ordered some food, including the artichoke and spinach dip. About half way through the dip, we ran out of bread and my client asked the waitress if we could get some more. Her response? You guessed it.  When my customer asked me if he had violated some unknown, Portage County etiquette regarding bread, I assured him that he was fine but it was going to cost him a buck.  When our server returned he understood what I was talking about. Unfortunately, our dip had cooled quite a bit by the time our $1 bread arrived. His take? ""That's just silly.""

For the owners of the Bar 145 chain - Why do you have this policy and why do you handle it so awkwardly? It's tacky and unprofessional.  For the $2, it has cost you over $1000 in sales in just the past year. If I wanted the opportunity to biggie size my meal for a buck, I'd go to Wendy's. Overall, you have a great concept and I'd like to come back but I'm afraid that I won't have the correct change to use your bathroom. If you are attempting to generate additional revenue, you are going about it the wrong way. If you are trying to keep costs down, you are going about it the wrong way. If you are trying to curtail people trying to get free food, you are going about it the wrong way.",Restaurant
WGcLI9rgyVNxYUu-Ar2-hg,lcrcput-8GMw6St64LIr9Q,S3-JpB5dBhMXmauMqeoN-g,2011-04-12,"This is one of those true Yelp success stories.

I grew up mostly in Madison but lived in Milwaukee for a number of years where Mexican food is ridiculously good.  Whether it be from one of the amazing restaurants on the Southside or the authentic Mexcian grocers (El Ray), you really can't go wrong.  Up until I went to Taqueria, I hadn't run into a restaurant in Madison that I would even deem ""acceptable"" for Mexican food.

There's a few places that were decent, but nothing that ever stuck out or that had all the right stuff put together.  Each place lacked either taste, proper pricing, or variety on their menu.

Well Taqueria Guadalajara solves that issue ten-fold in my opinion.  They are pretty much just what others describe here; a very very small mom & pop operation with a comfortable environment and amazing food at good prices.  Portion sizes are also quite generous.  The staff is polite and the TV usually has either soccer or mexican soap operas on, adding to the authentic vibe.

The food needs to be emphasized here though, they have some fantastic options.  First off, the chips and salsas are tasty, they give you a hot blend which I found enjoyable and a mild blend which is has a very traditional taste (cilantro, tomatoes, etc).  Make sure though that you order Guacamole, even if it takes them a while to bring it out.  Their fresh homemade Guac is out of this world, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like Guacamole.  I have to put it on everything I get here though, as it's just that delicious.

Secondly, there are a few main dishes I've had worthy of note.  I'd say the best deal they offer are the tacos, my girlfriend got 2-3 tacos each time with a side, and I think they were about $1.75 or $2 per taco.  This isn't something from taco bell though, these are flavorful and fulfilling jam-packed tortillas, and if you get a side of rice and \/ or beans it should be more than enough food.  Some of my other favorites, albeit pricey, are the Mexican flag burrito and the Tortas (Mexican Sandwhiches) with slow-roasted pulled pork.  I'd rate one meat over the other, but the Carne Asada, the el pastor pulled pork, and the chicken were all mouth-watering.  Just make sure you wash it down with one of their many beers \/ sodas available.

Nobody's perfect, so there are a few minor qualms.  The service is terribly slow and inattentive.  They make up for it with warm hospitality, but we often had to wait for drink \/ chip refills to the point where we had finished the main course and usually had to wait a while to put in our order.  That said, they do get the main courses out promptly, the last time I went I had my meal in less than ten minutes.  Only thing is, we've seen this behavior when we went at 8pm at night on a weekday, so I have no idea how it is when they're packed.  My girlfriend said she went for lunch and it was crazy-crowded (she still got her food though).

Overall, Taqueria is a slice of delight in an unexpected location.",Restaurant

I've went back and fourth about writing this review.  I decided to give chapel of the flowers 3 stars for the following reasons:

Pros:
- Pastor Al was AMAZING.  He spent 5 minutes with us before the ceremony and our family and friends who watched it online asked if we spent more time with him.  He included a bunch of information about our home lives and our children and made it very personal.  It didn't feel like a rushed Vegas style wedding it felt personal and warm.  I was so very pleased with him.  He is also a huge military supporter and made that known to my husband and I and we truly appreciate him and what he does for all service members.

- Photos were AMAZING and our photographers were over the top amazing.  They also made it feel like they were our friends and not just doing their jobs to make a buck it was really fun and they came out great however their photo policies I have major issues with so that will go in cons.

- The grounds and chapel were beautiful which is surprising given the location it is in.

- Everyone we came across was professional and courteous.  

Cons:

-  To go back to view pictures we had to pay 65 dollars in a round trip taxi fare from MGM.  This isn't their fault but they should offer an online experience to people even if they can't make it back the next day.  I would have rather done it from my hotel anyway.

- The photo building is bizarre.  The rest of the grounds are very well kept but the building where you do your photos is very shoddy. The leather chairs are cracked and the stuffing and padding is sunken so you sit in it and basically fall into it.  The details that are made to have it look high end looks like someone rushed through it.  Cabinet handles are not centered, paint is peeling, flooring is coming up, etc.  It's not a big deal but I just found it to be odd that they seem to keep up the rest of the areas but this one looks like it was tossed together at a moments notice and they wanted it to look high end but they failed in that.  

- Now to the photo issues.  We purchased a photo package that entitled us 30 minutes with our photographer and 35 4x6 prints, 2 5x7's, and 1 8x10.  I knew there was an option to purchase digital rights before I went in.  When we got there we were a bit early but they took us as early as they could.  They took us to a booth where we were privately able to look at our photos.  We had a few hundred to look through and they were all beautiful.  We then got the sales pitch about buying the digital rights and they would knock 100 dollars off of it because we purchased a package that printed photos.  We would not get the printed photos but the $100 credit.  We weren't planning on getting digital rights still at this point.  We were told to pick our photos.  There was a second life style photographer also taking pictures.  I was curious when I saw her as to why we had 2 photographers as we didn't pay for 2 but didn't think much else.  The photos are inside of blocks on the computer screen with 3 different background colors.  The main photographers photos have a light grey border and the life style photographer have a light grey border.  Unless you are looking closely you will miss this.  

Well I was unaware that we could NOT choose photos from our life style photographer unless we either wanted to buy the digital rights or pay for single shots at at the cost of $10 for EACH 4x6.   My husband and I spent over an hour choosing our pictures only to find out that we had chosen 15 from the lifestyle photographer so we'd either have to buy the digital rights, purchase them separately  for $200.00 for 20 4x6's or choose again from the light grey pictures.  

The chapel NEEDS to be more clear about this and they need to change their colors to more vibrant primary colors.  The life style photography shots shouldn't even be able to be viewed when you are choosing photos that can be printed from your package because now we were in a situation where most of the photos we loved would NOT be included in our package that we had already purchased so we'd have to buy the rights for $800 dollars or purchase 20 prints for 200 or forget about it.  

If they had said ""The RED ones are your life style you can look at them however they are NOT included in your package but they can be purchased separately, the BLUE ones are included in your package to choose from"" that would have made our experience much better.  

We ended up buying the rights to the photos which I think is outrageously priced but the woman we worked with was very kind and even though I was very unhappy with what was going on she really did a good job of trying to handle the situation.  I just felt really ""dooped"" with this practice.  They don't make it clear that you can't choose certain photos with your package and then you're already emotionally invested.",Shopping

I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could but Yelp doesn't do partial. Loss of stars because of customer service. Kind of disappointed by the difficult reservation process and service my friends and I experienced this time. A real shame because I really loved my first visit. Maybe it was just due to the holidays and they are still adjusting\/training people?  

Anyways, I went to the restaurant to inquire about group bookings a few weeks ago since I was in the area. They don't take phone reservations for groups of more than 8 people. One of the staff wrote down the email I was to contact, which ended up being wrong. Granted, this was corrected and then forwarded to the right person. However, I was then given a PDF file to fill out for group bookings. Okkkay. Except beware the non-refundable $500 deposit charged if you decide to cancel within 72 hrs of reservation. They also charge 18% tip for groups too, but that's the norm. For cancellation deposit though, I just don't like having a policy like that over my head that allows little leeway. I've been to many high end dining restaurants and I have to say, this is the first I've seen such a high $$ charge for cancellation policy. Even my friends were shocked by it. 

Now, back to the form. Filling the form online is difficult, since you also have to sign it. Meaning, I have to print out the form, fill in info, scan and email it to myself. From there, I forward it to the booking rep with details about what floor I want it to be on (I chose rooftop). I should be done right? Nope. I have to then call the restaurant for a booking confirmation number and provide my credit card info again. No manager was available when I first called so I called back next day, still busy but an employee takes down my credit info. They said they would send a confirmation email in a few days. Days later, still no email. Have to call AGAIN. They said I will be getting a call soon. Next day, finally got a call confirming my booking and then they claimed they sent me a confirmation email. Not the case. So they sent it again but with wrong floor I want to dine at. T_T After I sent yet another email, reservation is finally fixed. 

Day of, apparently some of my friends came a bit early before our dinner time and asked about my reservation. Only to get the run around from hostess that they don't see my reservation on their list. My friend told me she saw it on the hostess screen and had to point it out multiple times until they finally ""saw it."" Idk, I missed experiencing that drama first hand. When we finally got seated, our server was nice and friendly, so no issues there. 

In terms of atmosphere, it was much louder then I expected (had to shout when talking), plus they sat our table next to the DJ and near the bar. I don't know what was happening with the servers but they kept dropping a large amount of glasses that night. I think it happened like 2-3 times while I was dining. 

For food, I tried the Cheddar Bacon Burger ($16.50). Its essentially the same as Feenie Burger ($18) without the sautéed mushrooms. A friend tried the Feenie and said she didn't like it much because bacon was too burnt? I had no issues with mine tho. Another friend tried the Butternut Squash Ravioli since she knew I liked it. I did tell her about the strong truffle smell and taste just incase but she didn't even notice the smell. Guess it depends on the individual. She really liked the dish as well. 

For drinks, I had a large Signature Sangria ($10) ...but I think they forgot my peach shot? Still good tho. One of my friends ordered the Cesar because she is obsessed with them and she enjoyed her drink too. Everyone else in my group had the daily drink special (Bellini for $6). 

Overall, they provide good food, reasonable prices, and great drinks. They just need to fix customer service, train employees more and find a more efficient booking process ASAP for me to continue recommending them. They could easily become my favourite spot if not for these issues. No customer likes to feel like they are jumping through hoops just to make a reservation. Atm, I would only come back for drinks and maybe dine during off times.",Restaurant
iGo0-QnPjLMAxUNxJKYUOQ,PL3h11VXhMwadl79Ndf6OA,pdLWNVfoGA1IrXkIjktcsg,2016-05-01,"Verizon customer for years.  I've used all the major carriers in the past.  Verizon seems to be the best.  However, when it is time to get a new phone or I have to visit my local store, I always feel like I'm getting scammed somehow.  Usually they are so versed at ripping me off that I am unable to catch it, but yesterday they slipped up.

I purchased two new iPhone 6s's in October 2015, 7 months ago.  Through all the sales talk, somehow I got convinced that I needed $35 screen protectors for each of the phones.  I earned some sort of discount, so it only cost me $28 each, instead.  The protectors offered a lifetime warranty, so if they ever broke, I just bring it in and get a new one.  Fine, I'll take it.

Fast forward to yesterday when I drop my phone on its face in the gravel.  It looks like the glass is broken, but only the screen protector was cracked, and it peeled right off.  Awesome!  I remembered I bought the protectors with a lifetime warranty.  So, I head to back to my local store where I purchased them.

Manager on duty approaches me, a young lady who was very nice, asking what brought me in today.  Showed her the protector and the phone.  She agrees with me that it is great the phone isn't damaged and she'll grab me a new cover.  Perfect!

She takes my old broken screen cover and tosses it in the trash.  She returns with the new cover, starts unpacking it from the box, and another associate walks up to her asking what he can do to help.  She tells him that I am buying this new cover.  Wait a sec, what?  

She says, oh yes, the cover you had on it was not the lifetime warranty one, but the new one is, so if anything happens to the new one, it will be replaced free of charge.  Hold on, I say, I remember I purchased the lifetime warranty cover when I bought the phones.  Very matter of fact-ly she says, nope, that is the non-warranty cover, you can tell by where it goes around the ear piece, it is a different shape.  She continues that I had the option to buy either the non-warranty one, or the lifetime warranty one, and most people just select the non-warranty one, just like I did.

Remaining persistent, I say no, I am pretty sure that it was the lifetime warranty cover.  She seems a bit annoyed with me questioning her on her knowledge of these covers, assuring me that she knows what she is talking about.  I ask her to look it up.  So, to punish me for my persistence she tells me that if I want her to look it up, she'll have to place me in the queue and I'll have to wait for the next available associate- there are two customers ahead of me.  

Fine.  I'll wait.

She goes over and sits on a chair with another customer, seemingly just chatting, her back toward me, while I wait 20 minutes.  As I sit there, I am second guessing myself.  I did buy the lifetime cover, didn't I?  Of course I did... or did I?  

An associate comes out of the back, likely coming off break, looking at the queue on his ipad.  It's my turn.  He is about to come over to me when the female manager says something to him that I can't hear, and neither can he.  She tells him to come over to her closer where she whispers a paragraph or so.  He looks up at me and comes walking over asking how he can help.  

I explain what happened.  He looks up my screen protector purchase.  He asks where the old cover was.  I  point to the trash can where she tossed it.  He gets the cover out of the trash.  He takes one look at it and says, yep, that's a Zagg cover- it's the lifetime replacement one.  I told him that she told me it wasn't.  He says, no it's easy to tell where it goes around the earpiece- I've got you covered.

BAM!  It all hits me.  This manager, in an attempt to make an extra $35 off of me, lied to me about my broken cover, trying to deceive me into buying a new one, hoping I would just be too stupid to notice.  I guess all my feelings of getting ripped off are not unfounded.

So, I warn you, BEWARE.  These people, especially the female manager in the red Toms, have some pretty dishonest sales tactics.  The woman lied to my face without a bit of hesitation, like she pulls that move all the time.  I can't believe it would only be about protective covers.

In the end, the Zagg protective cover doesn't actually get replaced in the store, as they would lead you to believe when you buy it.  You have to mail the old broken cover into Zagg and pay a $5.99 processing fee to get a new one mailed to you, which takes a week.  

She could have just looked at the cover when I walked in and told me I needed to go and have it replaced online.  She knew it was the lifetime replacement cover.  I would have been in and out.  But instead, she had to try to deceive me into spending another $35 at her store and make me suffer with a long wait because I didn't fall for her shenanigans.

I'll give two stars, though, as I will still return for more abuse in the future.",Shopping
HgsDbZpVOm-0SS4J-F5Cwg,tX4d5ktzse4TPxNOds4VCw,dGRTBM-KxycUoRVihI3Kyg,2014-10-27,"Sash & Bustle was the second of four stores that I visited this past week for my gown hunting adventure with my family (who flew in specifically for the purpose of helping me find the dress I will get married in).

I don't think it's fair to write a review on a bridal store based on whether or not it is the location where I will purchase my bridal gown, so I am going to focus on the dresses themselves, the service, the prices, and any other tidbits that may be interesting for brides-to-be (and in some cases, members of the bridal party as well).  My hope is that my review will help you make an informed decision about whether or not this store is worth visiting during your own bridal gown adventure.

PRO:
The selection is clearly put together with love and is carefully curated to show off a variety of beautiful and fun pieces.  I saw styles here that I didn't see in any of the others stores I went to (including a very unique and highly memorable tea-length blush -coloured dress that was covered in hundreds of hand sewn pearl-like beads).  The shop is quaint, and well-decorated in addition to feeling welcoming and comfortable.

CON:
Everything is sample sized, so you might not necessarily get the clearest idea of what the dress will look like on your body type since there is only one size available to try on.  The store is also quite tiny (I've lived in the neighbourhood for 5 years and had no idea it was even here until I began my research) which means fewer samples overall.  I personally exhausted everything that fit the criteria I had in my head about what kind of dress I wanted quite quickly.

PRO:
There was a decent selection of off-the-rack dresses in the $1000ish price range in a multitude of different styles.  If you are okay with purchasing a dress that has been worn a number of times and may have some minor signs of wear, you potentially could walk home with a beautiful and formerly expensive dress that day.  As well, the consultant even encouraged me to try on dresses that were out of my price range so I could get a feel for what looked good on me even though she knew I would likely not be able to make a purchase of some of these higher-priced gowns.  She actually made me feel like she cared about my bridal journey more than she was concerned with making a sale, which was highly unexpected.

CON:
Personally, didn't find that any of the new, made-to-order dresses that fit my criteria fell into my price range.  I was trying to keep my budget around $1000 before alterations with the willingness to go a little bit over that number if I found the PERFECT dress.  The consultant encouraged me to pick what I liked, but everything I ended up trying on was well over where I wanted to be in terms of price, even though I was told that some of the gowns did in fact start at $1000.  I felt badly because I don't like the idea of a) wasting the consultants time or b) taking a time slot away from a bride with a healthier budget.  Mostly, I wish that the dresses had tags attached with the prices on them.  As it was, I would have to ask about the price any time I saw something that interested me.  As much as I wish money wasn't an option, I do have to remain budget conscious with this decision.  As the appointment went on I felt a little embarrassed that my budget wasn't larger and that I shouldn't have been here in the first place.  That being said, consultant never made me feel badly about it (which is why this store still gets a solid 4-star review from me).  Throughout the appointment I felt myself dealing with an internal struggle of trying on a beautiful gown and wanting to fall in love, but knowing that no matter what I was willing to give up at my wedding, I just couldn't justify purchasing a dress that ran $1500 over budget!.  And when you're thinking about dollar amounts, it's tough to stay in the moment and just enjoy the experience.  I guess I went in believing that there would be more that was within my budget, and there just wasn't.  If the dresses had been marked with prices, it would be been easier to make sure I was only trying on stuff that I could see myself happily wearing AND paying for.  So more than once, I would get a stunning dress on only to find out it was a little further out of my reach than I had anticipated.

PRO:
I was the only bride in the store, so all attention was focused on me and my family, and my wants and needs.  I never felt rushed or hurried to get in an out of dresses or make any decisions right then and there.  As well, photos were allowed!  YAY!

tl;dr conclusion: If your budget it tight, you might end up like me and not find what you want.  If your budget it healthy, you will be delighted not only the beauty of the dresses in the collection, but also overjoyed with the one-on-one attention.",Shopping
b1boCj-NDP8msWiCj4yGPg,Oxe8DXjBOi6C-cR2w64zOg,D4mjIxNRmC7ZTlLFVxSyuQ,2014-11-03,"I was eager to try out this new brunch and supper joint at Gerrard and Logan.

The interior is almost as hipster as you could imagine. Think steel buckets holding the utensils, nouveau-rap-rock music constantly blaring from the speakers, denim-looking napkins and teeny tiny almost-shot-size glasses to drink your tap water out of. Oh, and tea and coffee comes by default in French presses. 

Whether or not you like the ambience will entirely hinge upon how much you like or dislike general hipster vibes. I personally am sorta neutral to that kind of atmosphere, but was really grateful and relieved to see that the helpful, smiley, genuine staff did not exude any stereotypical hipster sultriness. What did bother me though, was the descriptions of some food items on the menu. The baked beans, sausage and fried egg I ordered was described as :'molasses baked beans (I could not taste any molasses), farmer's sausage (uh...what? There was hardly any sausage with it, anyway) and an 'over-easy cluck' (turns out this ridiculous description was a mere fried egg). 

I'm sure some people would find these elaborate descriptions funny; me, hungry and decaffeinated and wanting to order quickly, found it distracting and annoying. To each their own!

Staff were all around fantastic. 100%. The hostess welcomed us immediately and seated us at the bar, on surprisingly comfy stools. The man behind the counter making cocktails and hot drinks was a joy to deal with, really friendly and funny with an attitude that would put a smile on anyone's face. One of the chef did her work while dancing around and generally loving life. Brilliant!

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the great expectations set by the staff. The baked beans came a bit too crunchy for my liking and the sausage parts were barely noticeable. In fact, had I ordered simply beans, toast and egg, without sausage, I may not have even noticed that any sausage was present, or may have just commented 'huh, seems like a bite of sausage found its way into my dish'! Disappointing. The toast came dressed with olive oil, which I hate, and I did not know about this dressing when I ordered. Gah. What's wrong with butter?! 

There was a $1 for ketchup. BOOOOO.

Boyf liked his buttermilk pancakes but was still starving after having eaten them, and not happy about the portion size (small) vs price ($9).

I know it's a cliché to say 'I really wanted to love this place', but I really, really did. The staff were as great as I've ever encountered, I love French press coffee, it's nice to see a trendy place opening in an otherwise dull intersection, and I admire the much-written about community spirit of the chef and the establishment overall. Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy my meal enough to warrant giving this place any more than three stars - and that's at a stretch; I feel I have to be generous as the staff were lovely and the place is still new so I don't want to be harsh.

I may return and try something else - I do hope to be proved wrong if I do come back.",Restaurant
q3nZ_iJ4-WN_3ZGNb7OWww,jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,2013-08-02,"I, for the life of me, cannot understand how anyone could give this place any less than five stars. I mean, what restaurant were you eating at? Because this is most definitely the most innovative, forward thinking, evolved restaurant I believe I've been to in this town in a LONG time.

I mean, you walk in and you really don't understand what you're in store for. The concept is on the windows, but you don't really get the gist until you sit down and open up this fabulous menu.

I was only slightly, slightly disappointed that some of the things on the menu were discontinued as they are going through a seasonal menu change (for sure a sign of a great restaurant) and were knocking things off at them moment. Trust me when I say that lasted all of about 10 seconds. 

The concept is this: whatever you eat, be it vegetarian, pork, chicken, etc. You have a set menu for each type of food. It's all covered, each one, on one small page, but the tastes are SO big. Also, there are rumors that this is a tapas bar, but that isn't quite true. Yes, the plates are all sold separately, there are no sides, but the plates are a nice sized portion, not that tiny things you get at a regular tapas bar. That's misleading as heck. I was stuffed after I had just three plates!

I personally (as a pescatarian) had the smokey poke. Let me tell you, that was some deliciousness on a plate. The poke sits atop several sauces (of which I've forgotten at the moment) and I was encouraged to dip some in each. Whatever. I totally mixed that all together and then inhaled it. I got a little of the smokey, a nice bite of spicy and some mellow flavors that balanced it all out. It was fresh and delicious.

My second plate was the elote. Listen, I would love to sit here and wax eloquent about how delicious this was, but I'm just going to go ahead and say it: if I could mainline this into my veins I would have OD'd, oh, several MILLION times. There are no words for how great this dish is. I can't even go on, I'm getting emotional about not being able to go get some more right now. And then an hour later, and an hour after that. Hi, I'm Nickolle and I'm an elote addict. CRACK on a cob. That's what they should call it. Try it and come to meetings with me. We'll get through this together. (this is corn on the cob that you grab and eat with your hands - lick your fingers afterward, no one cares)

Next up for me was the lotsa-mozza. This is essentially cheese, polenta, eggplant and tomatoes. But yet so much more. Anyone who has ever taken cheese and melted it in a hot pan knows the delicious taste. That's sort of this, but with sliced mozza and other things in between, specifically, sweet polenta (mmmmm...). The thing that brings this all together is the taste of that melted, crunchy cheese. So, so good. So good.

For dessert (like, someone stop me, okay?) I had the cream cheese lote. I obviously have a cheese addiction as well. I was going to go for the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream, but I wasn't ready to be jolted out of my mellow taste experience with something that sweet. I was super pleased that I didn't. This is a flat bread that is the consistency of a crepe, but with a little more crunch. The cheese actually is very subtle as is the cream anglaise. It sits atop some little bubbles, I can't remember the name name now (arghhh!), but they were sweet when I popped them in my mouth. There were different flavors and they really added some zing to the sort of savory taste of the crepe\/cheese combo. Really pleasing to my mouth!

This restaurant is a brand new fave and I can't wait to go back. The owners are so friendly and awesome that I want to be their new best friend. As much as I'm about to start going I'm pretty sure we'll be on a first name basis soon! Get here. FAST.",Restaurant
Ihhwan6gBWGGr8yQrsi7Nw,zGOe5Jj9H7XbeSHggBU8Dw,-L7mpRnghi0ZlSsO5wExZA,2016-04-29,"I recently visited this Walmart location for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I will never be back ...actually I will never go to another Walmart again after what I witnessed. I was doing some shopping on a Saturday around 12pm-1pm. The store was fairly busy. I walked by the beauty department and over heard someone yelling at another person. I followed the voice and found where this voice was coming from. The beauty manager was YELLING and very inappropriately putting down a demo rep. I hid in an area where I could watch without being seen by the manager (I later found out this managers name was Claudia). She was yelling at the rep for having her vendor sticker on incorrectly. This manager told the rep lady where to put the vendor sticker, then changed her mind and made her change the spot again and again. Claudia even said something to the effect of ""I know you think you're too good for this badge but that's just too bad!"" Really?!?! who says this?!?! There was NO indication that this rep thought she was ""too good"" for a sticker. This rep followed everything that the manager said and without argument. This manager walked away and the rep began helping customers...even me. She had a smile on her face even though it looked like she was gonna cry. She showed me her coupons and explained the sale then gave me one. I then just started looking at other beauty products in the area and that was it. There was NO WAY the rep was harassing me. I then heard Claudia's piercing voice call the rep over and tell her that she was harassing customers. WHAT?!?! No Claudia, you are the one who is harassing people. I got close again and heard Claudia tell the rep that she now needed to stand in a different spot and get a table to stand behind. The rep explained that she was not instructed by her company to bring a table therefore she did not have one. She then let out a huge annoying sigh and brought over another associate. She then took off and he got right in her personal space in her face and said ""She is the boss. I don't care what the request is! You are NOBODY and I couldn't care less about your ""little coupons"" because your company will just replace you with someone who listens!"" Ummmm....what? He then walked away. I then walked up to her and said I was so sorry about what just happened. Was there someone I could call to help her? She said that she was fine and wished me a good day. I ran into another associate and asked for the beauty managers name. I then said ""it seems that shes a rough manager, I feel bad for you guys. Shes treating the rep like shit."" The guy said ""Yes, she hates having reps here and will find any way to possibly get them kicked out. Its because they make way more money then she does."" Well Claudia, if you want to make more money then go find another job that will pay more and that you enjoy instead of ripping people apart and being incredibly disrespectful. 
I later called the store and CLAUDIA answered. I acted like I didn't know who she was and told her what happened. I figure hearing that a customer SAW this treatment would shift her a little. NOPE. Claudia basically called me a liar. She asked where in the store I was multiple times and said she was going to pull tapes and review them (which I know they wont). I told her a person like the manager should not have a management position because they obviously cannot handle ANYTHING. She said ""well there was other issues with the vendor that you don't know about"" I said that I didn't care but a person should never speak to another person that way and a WALMART MANAGER should NEVER EVER THINK of speaking to another human that way...ever. It is just unacceptable."" She didn't say much and told me should would take care of it and rudely hung up on me. 
Since I got no where with the store, I called corporate. They thought it would be a good idea to have a manager from that store call me back...well I don't agree. I already tried to speak with the store manager and obviously got no where. I am now waiting for someone from the regional office to call me. This is an issue that is unacceptable. I can not believe Walmart has such a horrible, heartless person working as management. I really hope that Walmart takes this issue seriously and makes adjustments with their staff.",Shopping

You can read about my initial experience in my first review.  However, the person from the management team provided a reasonable explanation for why they are reluctant to seat too many patrons at one time (they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen staff and compromise the food quality).  Moreover, the person I exchanged e-mails with was very interested in making sure that my future experiences at Cowfish would be really good.  He even wanted to send me a gift card to compensate me for the inconvenience from last Saturday.  I turned down the offer for the gift card and the offer for ""special"" treatment.  I feel that a restaurant should do a good job of attending to everyone - not just folks who have complained.  But, I give the management a TON of credit for working so hard to make this restaurant successful.  

With that as an introduction, here's the scoop on Cowfish.  

The food was really good.  Surprisingly good, actually.  I ordered a cucumber appetizer with sweet and spicy sauce, and then I ordered two rolls.  One roll was a specialty roll - Mark's Roll - and the other was from their ""Burgushi"" menu.  All three items were excellent.  The appetizer was huge, and very reasonably priced.  The sauce\/dressing on the cucumbers was tangy and spicy, yet it wasn't too heavy or too hot.  The special roll - Mark's roll - was fantastic.  It had jalapeno, tuna, cream cheese and a bunch of other items.  The roll was flash fried and served with a spicy sauce on the top.  The ""burgushi"" roll was called ""Doug's Filet"".  Basically, it was a Philly roll covered with filet mignon (seared slightly, but still very raw).  This roll was huge, and it was very heavy.  However, it was also very tasty.  I didn't like this roll quite as much as Mark's Roll, but it was still an item I would order again.  

My girlfriend also ordered a sushi roll - from the ""make your own"" menu - as well as a Cowfish bento box.  The Cowfish box contains a mini burger, a small roll, and some side items.  It's a great deal for $11.   

I was surprised to find that Cowfish is actually a good value.  The rolls I ordered were $14, but they were huge.  Two of them left me absolutely stuffed.  (In fact, I couldn't finish all of the food I was given.)  With the appetizer, three beers, the bento box, and three rolls our tab was $72.  Not bad at all for Charlotte.

A few last comments... Cowfish is really, really noisy.  The atmosphere is fun, but it isn't a place for an intimate conversation. And, unfortunately, the service still isn't great.  The folks we interacted with were very kind and helpful.  (Which was not the case last Saturday.)  However, the restaurant is so popular right now that they are struggling with some basic issues.  We waited almost ten minutes to get our first beers.  Our server was VERY apologetic.  He said the back up was due to it being half priced martini night.  That's not a very compelling excuse, though.  They know in advance that it is half priced martini night.  They know they are very popular right now.  It's important to have enough staff to serve all of the customers in a timely fashion.  At the end of the meal our server - an incredibly nice guy - seemed to go AWOL.  I think that this was due to his waiting on the manager to come by to visit us as first time customers.  It's nice that the manager checks in with first time customers (even giving out a coupon for a free appetizer on the next visit), but I value my time more than I value a free appetizer.  I was tired and I was ready to go.  Yet, we didn't have our bill.  

I would give Cowfish 3.5 stars right now.  I suspect that the service will improve over time, and I can easily imagine it becoming a 4 star restaurant.  I certainly look forward to going back.",Restaurant

After many years of being told that Lawrenceville was the ""next shadyside"" but without the cost it seems that this may finally be occurring.  Sure there is many points of view with respect to gentrification... oh wait... this is supposed to be a food review not a sociological diatribe...sorry...So, we stopped here last night around 730 after I read a quick blurb from China Millman in the Post.  It seemed like my kind of place with unique food and tapas style dining.  It's on 35th St. on Butler street a few blocks from where Butler turns into Penn.  The front is a very nice gated courtyard with plenty of outdoor seating.  There wasn't anything available out front so we were seated inside.  There is an upstairs with a deck I believe, but didn't get a chance to try that out.  We were greeted quickly by a young Asian guy (Alan I think?), who was nice enough to complement me on my ""super size my foie gras"" t shirt (wrong on so many levels) and he seated us in the back in a small open type booth with some 20 somehting hipsters next to us.  There are two bars on your right as you enter the first is more of a liquor bar and the second is a longer bar that is more of a sushi and yakatori (bite sized marinated beef, chicken, etc.) type bar.  As far as I know this is the only yakotori joint in the city.  Perfect for you no carb nuts.  The lighting is dark and intimate and the feel is slick and contemporary.  Annie said it reminded her of places in NYC when she was there for years in law school.  The server greets us quickly.  He's a young hipster whose name is Ian.  We take some time and order our drinks.  Annie has a stiff vodka\/tonic and I get a little more adventorous and try the tamari-tini on the rox tasted like a manhattan to me but made with plum wine.  We start by ordering what seems like a ton of skewers (the name on the menu, but definitely fashioned after Japanese yokotori.  Don't get fooled by the cost they are about $2 each, but you only get about 2 bites from each one.  We tried the chix, beef, shrimp, clamari, mushroom and quail egg wrapped with bacon.   They were all served with a chimichurri, ponzo butter, and ginge dipping sauce.  The ponzo was the best sauce.  The chicken, mushroom, shrimp and calamari were all good, but forgettable.  The quail egg wrapped in bacon was by far the best and the beef was also really good.  I also tried there take on ceviche, trying the white tuna, salmon and octopus.  Again cheap price, but very small portions.. THe ceviche is served with peppers, onion and cilantro on a tiny piece of toast.  The sauce overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the seafood and this was a bit of a miss for me.  The fresh seafood should be the main attraction, with just a hint of the acidity from the citrus.  I then ordered 6 raw oysters and an oyster shooter.  These were japanese oysters and served on a lovely plate with some fish eggs, but for me they just didn't stack up as well to other domestic oysters I enjoy.  The oyster shooter was not that good either.  It was served in a cocktail glass half full with this overpowering sauce.  I guess I was just expecting a shot glass with vodka, and tobasco.  Finally I had the pork belly entree.  This was really good.  Spicy braised pork belly, beautifully plated with perfectly cooked pearl potatoes.  We shared a piece of delicious chocolate cake almost flourless infused with cayenne pepper from ""dozens"" next door.  It was really good.  I was impressed with the service and overall experience especially since they've only been open two weeks.  This is a good new addition and I'm sure if I made some better choices it would have earned four stars.  I'll be back again.  One last note keep in mind it is easy to spend $100 on dinner for two here even though many items are only a couple bucks, because of the portion sizes.  I prefer to eat many different small interesting bites, so I don't mind... But, these are not traditional ""Pittsburgh"" portions.",Restaurant

I made reservations 2 hours earlier to get us a spot because it was a friday night.  When we got there, we were seated in one of the side rooms as the restaurant was really busy that night.  Much to our surprise (after we ordered) there was actually a birthday party going on.  We were basically minding our own business, enjoying some appetizers (soup, fried chicken) when a live band started playing.  This was when it started to get really really annoying!  First of all, there was no door or anything to shield off the noise.  The noise level got to a ridiculous point and i just couldnt stand yelling  anymore to talk to my friends.  I finally flagged a waitress down as they werent paying much attention to the people outside of the party and asked her if she could kindly do something about the noise control... she looked at me with a blank stare and said, ""NO"".  UMmm ok....

After getting tired of waiting for someone to come and collect our order slip, i decided to give the order slip to the manager and complain about the noise.  When i found her, she was at the computer with her hands covering her ears.  She said she would do what she can.... 30 mins later while we were seated they closed one of the doors.  It didnt help much, but still it was nice that they tried.  After ordering dessert, when it was time to pay the bill the waitress came around with the machine and noticed that there was a $0.00 beside the tip... she asks, ""theres no tip?""  (I was going to leave a cash tip)  We just said, can i speak to your manager?  and sure enough... she came by and we just told her everything that went wrong.  It was a long night... what was supposed to be 1.5 hrs turned out to be 3 hours.  

PROS

The food - tried pretty much everything but my favourites included the spicy salmon and white tuna sushi, garlic beef (good, but not as good as ten-ichi's), spider roll, sashimi (all good), volcano roll etc.  

CONS

parking... one of our friends had to park at the community center across the street.

THE SERVICE!!!!  why would they allow a party with a really LOUD band and other customers seated basically next to each other.  They needed to either lower their volume or get some noise shield to filter that out.  If we had known about this before we wouldn't have eaten there that night!

We ordered stuff that they apparently didn't have like crab legs... the waitress told us that these were the specials but didn't even tell us what they did or didn't have.

The waitresses didn't come around as much as id like which i guess can be understandable because of the party.

The food took forever!  like i said before, what was supposed to take 1.5 hrs took 3 hrs.  ridiculous!

They didnt even come around to tell us when last call was making it too late for us to order some items.  

The rude and ridiculous waitress begging for a tip... that was just a unnecessary.  

So why did i give this place 2\/5 stars?  well because like i said, the food was great but the service made this dining experience one of the worst i've ever had.  We ended up going to tims to catch up on girl talk later... why didn't we think of that before?  haha!

i don't know if i'd return....",Restaurant
m-D6L3p9kqem8hqBjECbLA,MjA21jK_XRHJvMjtvvnxow,YJ8ljUhLsz6CtT_2ORNFmg,2014-09-26,"So you would think a very public british chef that makes a tv career reforming failing restaurants with ""Kitchen Nightmares"" or spends his time mentoring (read: for the most part screaming at and using a marine sergeants approach in the kitchen) up and coming chefs would really have a venue baring his name locked down tight.

Sadly no. Just no. In fact ""HELL NO"".

I came in with a group of 5 people to celebrate a birthday and try an early dinner since the latest winner of Hell's Kitchen had arrived 2 weeks ago. From my experience I feel like a bad friend for suggesting the place.

Really when you goto a restaurant there are 3 different things that you rate the place by: atmosphere (looks), food, and service. You measure your expectations of these things by location, chef, and price. So lets run down the list shall we?

The place itself is on the main casino floor of caesars casino and they had a great time decorating it with a lot of british pub flair that still is up beat and modern looking. So really they nailed it here. The bar area is very inviting and tvs on the walls make it comfy and the restaurant area is equally inviting. 

The problem of course is when you go to order the actual food. As I said we came in for an early dinner (6pm) so the venue was fully staffed and maybe only 20% full with patrons. This should be an easy task for the staff. But, my experience rendered that assumption otherwise. To be fair our waiter was extremely up beat and full of suggestions and we were sat quite quickly so I can put most of the onus of service issues on back of house. But upon ordering it took almost 30 minutes for the table to get their alcoholic drinks. That just doesn't ring well with anyone. Especially a group of people that are in the mood to celebrate. Whats even worse is the food took well over 40 min before appetizers and starters came out with one of the more attentive managers checking in on us the entire time being very shocked that food was moving so slow that I could have walked into the mall, ordered food at any other place, taken it to go, and eaten it before our starters came out. 

So lets talk about whats really most important, the food! Since we were in a group of mixed friends that all love to eat we kind of did a one of everything approach to our starters and shared whatever came out. This would be cool if there was some hit or misses but, in our case the entire table just got more disheartened right up front after the long wait which is kind of a great way to crush the excitement and spirits of your guests prior to the main course I guess. The sliders were way over cooked, the fried calamari was bland, the scotch egg was downright forgettable, the toad in the hole should have stayed in whatever hole it came from as it was absent of any real flavor, and the lobster roll had an odd after taste to it (more on this later). The only positives here were the fries and the lollipop wings. In fact we scarfed the fries because they were the only thing stood out as not just edible but tasty with the included aioli. 

So lets say if you order starters the only thing nearly worth while are the fries. From a british gastropub? Wrong on so many levels.

So now lets move onto the main course. Something you would want to do in a decent time after the first round of food. But, the kitchen staff had the idea of letting us wait till we were really hungry for it before serving it. Yes I am being sarcastic, no it wasn't cool, and as you can guess it was far from worth the wait. So the main course comes after 2 more rounds of drinks that took to long and a manger was still ""shocked"" at the food service time. If you're counting at home do the math and you can see this is entirely too long. The next round of food included the wedge salad that wasn't even a wedge and the dressing didn't even have the right to call itself Bleu Cheese as it lacked any flavor and was so watery we wondered what the dressing did to offend the chef, the scallops that hey were cooked perfectly yet lacked any trace of seasoning, the lobster mac & cheese that we all agreed should have skipped the lobster, the chicken pot pie with a perfect crust yet lacked any flavor from the inside ingredients and the short rib that was so unbelievably void of the texture and flavor that it was sent back with the question of why a place like this would serve something that is supposed to be flavorful and tender but comes off like a bad croc pot version of pot roast. The one shining positive was the BLT which we all agreed just nailed it.

So after trying almost half the menu we are left with fries and the BLT being the only things that are positive standouts? At this price point?!?!? Are you kidding me? 

When it comes to dessert the sticky toffee pudding was however to die for. 

Oh remember the lobster? Yeah all 3 people that had it felt slightly ill after. This place is a kitchen nightmare. Such a let down and a terrible experience.",Restaurant
S4b-L45bEdVH3_6GpUTG-A,8eJF-KpMAFZgPTPHMVERhA,XwV2-lISDp_5Acy72bA8Qg,2013-11-19,"I stayed in a queen queen strip view princess suite on the 12th floor for 4 nights in November. The weather was perfect and the sunrise and sunset over the strip was gorgeous. I would never have booked this hotel if it weren't for a wedding that I attended at the hotel. With that said, I am glad that I stayed at this hotel and was pleased to learn of its existence. I do not smoke and I am not a big gambler. This hotel is non smoking and non gaming. Perfect. 

I also traveled with two children under the age of 5, so this was ideal. What made this place even more ideal was the full kitchen, washer and dryer, giant two person jetted tub, balcony and indoor\/outdoor pool. Parking is valet only. The entrance to the hotel is soooo tiny and palm trees block the name of the hotel. Be on the lookout or you may miss it. 

Soooo...about the room. I have to say that the items in my room and overall cleanliness was inconsistent with another room I had the chance to visit. For example, I moved and upholstered chair to find a glass on the floor. There was a bottle cap under the executive desk. The amount of silverware did not match with the amount of plates we had. A nice touch was the laundry soap, dish soap and sponge. I brought my own laundry soap and dish soap and when I got to the hotel the first thing I did was strip the washer using Charlie's Soap. When I did a few loads of laundry some random items would come out with faint bleach stains - ruining them. I didn't complain, but I probably should have.  Coffee was never replenished. Toilet paper was never replenished without calling (three times!).  (I should say, however, that housekeeping called my room one evening since I did not receive service earlier in the day  to see if I needed anything.)  There wasn't a bag in my room for laundry\/dry cleaning services. The other room we visited had info about the hotel, including grocery shopping services and family meal services. These were important notices that were overlooked in my room. There was a breakfast door hanger...mark off what you want and have it delivered when you want (it said tax and gratuity INCLUDED...apparently they did not mean on the prices shown, they meant that it WOULD be included...so I was charged more than I thought).  

Speaking of room service...I had breakfast twice and lunch once. The food was very good and came within 30 min of ordering. However, I found things to be inconsistent. For example, one day I received three types of jelly for my toast, another day only two types were received. One day I received one tea bag and one jar of honey, another day I received two bags and one slice of lemon. Note: it said I would receive an assortment of tea. The $4 berries were pretty sad. Two of the four raspberries had a bit of mold. The bacon was VERY good. One day the omelet was fully cooked, another day it was a bit runny. No salt and pepper was ever provided, nor was any in the room. The breakfast potatoes were pretty good, however, one day I received nearly double the amount of another day. You get the point... For the price I paid for room service, I expect consistency. 

The pool deck could use a good pressure washing and the fabric on the cushions to the deck furniture needs replacing (it makes the pool look so trashy). In fact, I have seen the Facebook updates for the Platinum Hotel and they often provide pictures that are completely inaccurate to what the hotel really looks like today. It's like ordering something from a menu based on its description and photo and once the food arrives it is unappealing and definitely not what you had seen in the photo...but it's still edible. The pool is still do-able...it's just not as organized as the photo on the website claims....i.e. no towels rolled up an individually placed on each chair, there were old cushions with not covering just piled up in the indoor pool area, etc. 

The spa staff was nice...I needed Chapstick badly and they had some (I was willing to pay $$$$ to get some relief) for only $2. The valet staff was so nice! Always willing to give directions and they even provided a cab like service in one of their suburbans for my cash paying husband when he needed to get to a hotel a few blocks over. 

Unfortunately my kid got sick and I didn't attend the wedding...but the 17th floor location at sunset seemed perfect for a small wedding (I attended the rehearsal). Instead my room overlooked the pool area and there was another wedding going on at the same time. It seemed like the folks there had a good time and the loud music blaring from the pool deck and roof top didn't seem to phase my room. The coordinator for the wedding I was supposed to attend was kind enough to have my meal boxed up...and I have to say that it was no where near as tasty as the room service (I can only assume the food comes from the same kitchen). 

Anyhow, I enjoyed my time at this hotel...there were just some things that bugged me. 

In short, I would stay here again.",Beauty

There exist numerous features interspersed throughout the lobby, some being of course the gambling area, and restaurants like Zenshin Asian Restaurant (visited twice in a row in my visit of a month ago), and Steak & Shake.  The actual hotel portion of the establishment is well-laid out, well lit, well everything.  The rooms are very comfortable, roomy, and perfectly clean.  Everything felt professional, as it should always.  We stayed for 3 days\/3 nights.  The view wasn't worthy of its own review (update), but it's nice and the actual room is virtually free of noise, or any other unpleasant distraction.  Plenty to keep one busy.  Not to mention, the outside parking is operated by valet staff; when a patron visits another destination (i.e. the Vegas strip), the car is perfectly taken care of.
     Room quality:  It all worked very well.  Again, the room the family stayed in was very sanitary for such a large hotel, roomy\/expansive, and comfortable, free from noise, even from the hallways.  The usual accompanying odor in hotel rooms was absent.  Staff changed the bed sheets every couple of days, preventing dissatisfaction from a succeeding customer.  When the blinds, which worked super well, were closed up by us, it felt just like nighttime at daytime, a good thing!
     Restaurant quality (Zenshin):  Now, I usually break restaurant quality down into four categories:  Food quality, food quantity, service, and atmosphere.  Here, I will not make a clear distinction.  Here goes nothin'...The food in the only real restaurant tasted good enough.  Sushi offered had good rice, and tasty meat\/fish, served in good portions.  Service worked timely.  The atmosphere felt modernized for the better.  Whew.  Don't worry, I'm going to elaborate on the Zenshin restaurant in another review.  Four stars, prob.
     Service:  Service worked well; in restaurants (in this case restaurant, that restaurant being Zenshin), the food was served at the right temperature, and accommodatingly so.  We felt pleased to be at Zenshin, and for that matter, the whole casino.  Valet staff did their work efficiently, and I have nothing to complain about that.
     Atmosphere:  For a large casino hotel like this, the atmosphere isn't half-bad (what comes to mind when I think of a half-bad place is a place where the lobby is full of smoke, and same for the rooms).  Roomy, nice, expansive, clean.  Can that be said for the majority of large casino hotels?  Modern as well, yet so pleasing.





     Venues:  Considering this hotel is located in Vegas of all places, I figure it's time I finally explain how South Point fares in its proximity to good local venues.  You know, the main reason we visited was to participate in a contest held at UNLV.  The university wasn't too far down, actually.  Other venues include restaurants outside of the hotel space, and attractions, including the exterior of Treasure Island.  We wanted to see some major shows like the Bellagio fountain show, but we hadn't the time.  All good!
     Location:  I would say isolated, but good!  The distinct location, away from the Vegas strip populated by many, helps in giving it that serene, clean atmosphere.  It's still not TOO far away from the Strip however.  This is probably the best location they could have built it in.
     Overall:  Distraction free, but not free.  And by ""not free"" I of course mean it literally, but also figuratively.  It's not expensive in a particular sense of the word, but not too cheap.  A great place to stay in Vegas!

1. No parking structure! There is complementary valet.

2. You can park over at the Aria's structure, ride the tram over which connects to the Bellagio\/Vdara and then check in! 

3. There is NO casino and NO smoking!

4. There is a bar as well as a small market\/deli like area within the Vdara.

5. Spa services on the second floor, pool on the third floor.


The following events though have led me to believe that we either had a REALLY untypical stay at the Vdara or just really bad luck.

When we got to the reception, there was no wait, which was very nice. A few people were checking in at the time, but there was a person available within a few minutes to help us. I smiled warmly at her and told her that my girlfriend and I were staying for our five year anniversary and we hoped she would help us make it extra special. We booked a corner suite to begin with because I didn't want to do the $20 tip trick, the price point was similar, and there was a guarantee that we would get a ""nice"" room. She immediately told us that she could upgrade us for $20 to a larger suite. And that the current suite we had was on a lower floor.

This surprised me because at EVERY hotel on and off the strip, an upgrade is pretty much a freebie. They want you to have a great impression of the property, lose money, and pay for services, and then come back. I was displeased, but I didn't want to spoil our vacation mood, so I agreed to the upsell. My girlfriend booked the reservation and she handled most of the check in paperwork. She never told my girlfriend to put me down as an additional guest.

Anyways, we were ready to start a relaxing hot soak in the tub and plan the rest of our evening. When we got into the room I was really disappointed about how technologically backward the room seemed to be. Every button seemed to have been pushed several thousand times and the lettering was gone, the shades control itself was buggy, and the lights were not automated. The bed sheets were really scratchy and were rough. The only really cool thing was the full stove, microwave, and fridge! However, shortly after that pleasant discovery, the real terrible stuff began to emerge.

The tub had water still in it. Not sure if they just cleaned the tub, but there was lots of water in it. I opened a drawer next to the bed and found two dirty, black socks from a previous guest. Finding this prompted me to tell my girlfriend to search other cabinets for other items left behind by the guest. She opened up the dishwasher and discovered a terrible smell and to our dismay dirty plates and kitchenware. I called the front desk and complained and immediately, we were upgraded to a much larger suite and higher floor.

I wished at that point I could say, our stay was amazing and we lived happily ever after. We got up to the floor and there was a strange chemical\/mildew smell going on in the air. It was very unpleasant, but it didn't get into the room. The door handle looked like it may have been busted in by another guest who tried to get in the room forcibly during a previous stay. We walked into our room and the shades were down. The same faded lettering was on the controls. Once I raised the shades, the view was absolutely spectacular.

The first thing we did was order turn down service, setting it for 6:00 PM for the rest of our stay. We got home that night and found out that the housekeeping lady wasn't aware that there were two guests. It turns out because my girlfriend didn't know and because the check in person didn't tell her that she should put me down as a guest, the housekeeper turned down only one side of the bed. It was late though and we were tired from our day, but I contacted the housekeeper the next day. 

I wanted to take a shower. The water came out hot and ready in seconds, but the showerhead was also busted and spewing water onto the tile outside the shower. After adjusting the head back in, it spewed a little less water. Anyways, after the shower the bedsheets like before were scratchy. In fact, I got a nasty rash from them and decided to sleep on the comforter instead.

The next day, we came back around 7 PM and I expected turn down service to be nicely done and the room to be in better order. We arrived to a room that had not been serviced or turned down. We were sure to leave the room's privacy light off when we left that morning. We were disappointed, but thought they were busy and would come later. We left to go out for the night, and came back to a room that was still not turned down. To annoyed and tired, we went to sleep and complained the next day. Turns out the charges that were promised to be waived weren't. And in fact, the notation for the upgrade for $20 overall was incorrect. It was $40.

At the end of things, we settled up with the manager who was the best part of our stay. I hope that my stay was not typical to the Vdara, and I  hope that you guys have a better experience.",Beauty

I lucked out in getting a great deal to The Signature- A one bedroom suite for three days at less than $300 including taxes and fees. It was through a third party source but noneless was much much less than their website advertised.

First thing you should know is this IS NOT a hotel\/casino. It's a hotel snuggly located in the back of MGM. The hotel is nicely connected (Air Conditioned!!!) via walkway to the MGM so you can get your gambling fix. Each tower has its own, small, hotel guest only pool. With that comes access to the MGM pools and lazy river, you know should you want to catch a case of Hep. Our tower had a starbucks and small bar\/lounge area. I liked the gated entry to the hotel and seperate front desk and valet for each tower. It really made coming in and out hassle free*. 

We arrived well before the regular check-in time but was allowed to go up to the room in 45 minutes to an hour. No big deal as this gave us an opportunity to meet the rest of our party at MGM. Check-in was painless and took less than 10 mins. A plus in my book and because our time was reserved through an outside service was relieved that they didn't lose our reservation.

Going up the the 25th floor we were impressed by the foremost entrance door and foyer shared with our neighbor to the left. Nice touch for the extra privacy and barricade against any hallway noise. 
Our room, located in Tower 1, had nice views of the MGM pools below, the airport in the distance and MGM\/south strip. The living room was a nice size, contemporary décor, a sofa bed, dining table, and beautiful built in cabinetry that housed the flat screen TV. 

The mini kitchenette came pimped out  with high-end appliances like Miele, Sub-Zero and furnishings by Kohler. It also came furnished with a 4-cup coffee machine, dishwasher (soap and sponge included) and blender for an afternoon margarita. The room was geared with just about everything a home chef would need to make meals from the comfort of their own suite; dishes, cups, pots, pans, utensils, knives, cutting boards and serveware. If you weren't in the mood or had the time to cook the hotel also had 24 hour room-service at your disposal.

Our master suite was pretty damn sweet with floor to ceiling windows and views of the east, south and west end. The highlight of the master suite was the quietly motorized TV lift cabinet that sheltered our flat screen TV-my husband's favorite feature. The room had plenty of space and storage offering his and hers closets with security safe. 

The bathroom is what completely turned me around from staying anywhere else. While expansive and having an enormous whirpool tub, seperate vanities, his and her sinks, seperate bathroom, all glass shower and extra towels and robe-here's the kicker- It had a hidden washer and dryer. Can you believe it?? Say it with me. A washer and dryer. No more sending out your laundry or coming home with bags of cigarette smoke, alcohol laiden funky smelling clothes. Yes, they also provided single wash detergent soap. I couldn't believe it.

For the most part our stay at The Signature was close to perfect. we didn't have daily housekeeping clean our rooms even though we asked for it electronically and were told our toilettries would be replenished. The one thing that ruined this experience for us was concierge, in particular an extremely bitchy, unhelpful, inconsiderate female employee. If I'm reading all the previous reviews correctly I'm sad to say that she may still be employed here and I've just had a dose of her that I had prayed to avoid during my stay.

We had over $15,000 worth of property locked in our room safe and on the night before check-out showed 'SERVC' prohibiting us from using our code and retrieving our items. Calling concierge she advised us that the hotel could not come up to unlock the safe due to security reasons. What??! 

It's apparent I've been staying here for the last two days, checking out tomorrow and you're saying you can't open the safe because you think I'm trying to jack whatever is in there? What in heavens make you think that the property wasn't mine? Bitch please. I want my shit out and will not leave until someone opens this god d*mn safe! After much dispute they sent security up to simply open the safe. It took less than a minute to do so and we were able to get our items. He said if we ever need anything else to call them directly to receive better service. He knew exactly who we had dealt with.

Would I stay here again? Absolutely. Perhaps reserving directly with the hotel next time so that we aren't given the run around about what can or cannot be offered and serviced. Dealing with the soul-less staffer?? I'll just have to take a gamble on. Afterall, it is Vegas.",Beauty

Wanted to get a much-needed mani\/pedi before my sister and my dinner with a friend Saturday night, so I brought baby sis, my niece, and me to Scottsdale Nails II, but we were told the staff was fully booked until later on that afternoon, around 430p (it was around 1030a).  I told the man at the desk that we had other plans for the day and needed two mani\/pedis right away before lunch, so he suggested we try out McDowell Mountain Nails on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd.  I've never been, but I knew the location, so I told my sister ""why don't we try it?""

Situated at the Target plaza, between a Jamba Juice and a Ross on FLW east of the 101, MMN was easy to find.  It looked very unassuming from the outside, certainly much smaller than Scottsdale Nails II and my ex-favorite Shea Nails on 92nd St. (please read my reviews).  It was small indoors, but clean, and most importantly, lacked the horribly strong stench of chemicals that greeted us at Scottsdale Nails a few minutes before.  We were greeted by a young Caucasian male who was standing next to a female Asian, who was speaking on the phone.  A little different, since we're used to frequenting salons entirely staffed by Asians...  I asked if the two of us would be able to have our mani\/pedis worked on right away, as well as my niece and her manicure, and he assured us most definitely.  The woman had by then gotten off the phone (thank goodness, as she was speaking directly to our faces while on the phone, instead of moving off to the side to give herself and us more privacy).  He told her what we were looking for, and she proceeded to tell him who to pair us up with.  I heard that I was going to get ""the new girl,"" which then made me think, ""why me?""  ""Why do I get to try the new girl?""  I wasn't worried, however, as I had a feeling everything would work out fine.  After choosing our polish materials, we all went our separate ways.

The ""new girl"" Ann, was a joy to be with!  While she is new to this company, she told me she's been a nail tech for many years.  She had just finished a couple hours of orientation (she learned what the packages\/treatments were called, and what steps she had to fulfill, etc.) that morning, and I was her first customer!  She worked gently, and listened to me tell her how we came to try out this salon, and would ask a couple of times if she was causing any discomfort.  Very easy to converse with- in case some of you are not able to understand staff with heavy accents, Ann speaks fluent English (and is studying Biochemistry... we're common souls!), so if this is important to you, ask for Ann.  :)

We finished slightly after my sister and her daughter.  My sister was seated for her spa pedicure before her manicure, while Ann started on my manicure first.  My niece was originally going to get just a manicure, but when I saw the embellishments that Linda had added to the nails, I asked how much it would be for a pedicure polish.  I was told $5 for just color, and $10 for the matching white polka dots and silver points.  I said let's get it done!

$55 for my gel manicure and spa pedicure, $25 for my niece's manicure (cleaning and polish) and pedicure (polish only), plus slightly over 20% tip*.  My sister got acrylic nails on her hands and a spa pedicure, as well.  We all left very happy and very satisfied with our new looks!  (Niece absolutely ENJOYED her first visit to the nail salon and cannot wait till their return here next year for another one!)  Thank you, McDowell Mountain Nails... I'll be a returning customer!

My first appointment, was scheduled by phone as I did not receive a confirmation through their online service. I understand that several bridal boutiques offer you refreshments and what not, not here.
I found the associate Tatiana to be patient and helpful - I didn't have a particular dress or designer in mind so she pulled several off the racks for me to try on. 
For what I got, I was happy with the price. I was instructed to not have them order it until I had my shoes so that they could do the proper measurements, as the benefit of this particular designer was that they would alter the dress (i.e. length and adjust the shoulders) in the making process to avoid further alterations. I was also able to make minor adjustments to the design. 
The dress arrived early this is where things started to go downhill. I put it on and didn't have the same dazzling feeling that I had when I tried on the sample. Considering that the sample was too big for me etc., I was a little surprised. I chalked it up to being in my head. When the dress was tied, the material (tulle) just brushed the ground, as desired. Now in front of the mirror, I could see that the dress just wasn't sitting right. The sewn in beaded belt was loose (the stones), I thought the train was shorter than agreed to and my shoes weren't on yet. Put my shoes on. The dress was too short. Maria and her boss (Vitali) insisted that when the dress was steamed that the tulle would drop and sit at the proper length but it was otherwise perfect and I wouldn't need to return until April to have the dress bustled. Having already thought I was off my game, I accepted what I was told, and left the store.
As the day went on, I kept going back to the pictures and the dress was clearly short. My fiance convinced me that we should ask them to steam the dress properly and try it on again. My fiance called the store and spoke to Vitali. Vitali told him that the store was closed on Sunday but he would have the dress steamed and would call me when the dress was ready and have me come back in.
A week went by and I called the store to see what was taking so long, Vitali then said oh we were waiting to see when you wanted to come in before we had it steamed. 
So now we are at the 2nd fitting and I put on my shoes and the dress is too short and it is clear the dress is unevenly cut at the bottom. The left side, perfect. The front short. The right too long. Maria asks if I would consider having the whole thing shortened and I did consider it but ultimately I wanted a floor length gown, not ankle. So she says she has to call the owner to see what can be done and I will likely have to pay to have it fixed. 
Vitali arrives and they compare the actual dress measurements (now November) to the ones taken in August. He tells me that they did make the dress to the measurements provided so I will likely have to pay to have it fixed. BUT WAIT, as Maria does some re-measurements, Vitali and her start whispering in another language while motioning at what she was doing. Something was obviously wrong [turns out it was measured incorrectly] So Vitali gets on the phone and calls the designer to tell them the situation.
He comes back and says that the designer is going to send them (the Bridal Suite) new tulle for the length of the dress for 1 or 2 layers. And they would detach the existing tulle, and reattach it with the two new layers, so essentially a cover-up of the existing short parts. He also said he would  do it free of charge as a gesture of goodwill (we had just bought the bridesmaid dresses). I agreed to the cover-up.
So after almost 2 hours at the store, just before leaving, I went to look at the sample again. Something was definitely not right. I then asked Maria to hang my dress next to the sample. The dresses were different (see pictures).
I agreed to the tulle cover but this will need to be rectified. He then tells me he doesn't see the differences and has the gall to ask me if this was a ""make or break"" for me. YES. 
The dress is to be remade. In Feb 2017 I ask to hang the new dress next to the sample before I try it on.  I am told the sample was sold
On the wedding day pinned inside of the dress was the in-store sample tags. Now I peak under the layers and see the cut crinoline layers (as mentioned above there should have been no crinoline). They had the sample altered and gave it to me.me as a ""new"" dress. Actually an acceptable solution but at least be honest about it.

My 3 previous trips were incredible, but this experience was so bad that I don't think I'll give them another chance.  The restaurant was packed on a Thursday night and the waitstaff quickly brought us water, but our waitress took quite a while to get to our table and greet us.  Within 10 minutes we received our basket of delicious handmade breads, and that was by far the best part of the meal.  We split an appetizer of Caprese Salad.  It is not a traditional caprese, as they drizzle both, a pesto dressing in one direction and a balsamic reduction in a mirror image.  The salad was tasty but at $12 it could have had a little more tomato and cheese.  
Now for the bad part...I've had 2 of the 10 best steaks in my life at this restaurant.  The other restaurants include Sparks Steakhouse in NYC, Bern's Steakhouse in Tampa, Peter Lugers in NY, and Charlie's Steakhouse in Orlando.  However, this steak wouldn't have passed for an Outback Special for $14.95.  I ordered the 16oz NY Strip (no bone) medium at $41.95.  The waitress explained slightly red center, mostly surrounded by pink and then a nice char on the outside.  That sounded good but that wasn't how it was served.  It was placed on the table and I looked at the steak jiggle as she moved her hand away.  I knew it was going to be too rare at that point, so I told her to stay until I cut into it. Sure enough it was about 2 minutes shy of medium.  I asked her kindly to put it back for just a minute or so and NOT TO OVERCOOK IT.   guess what.  It came back brown almost to the center.  I was livid but kept quiet because I was there to celebrate my girl's birthday and didn't want to make the evening about me.  She ordered the petite filet (8oz for $35.95).  Although it was tasty, her comment was, ""it's nice but you make a better filet at home.""  I was both delighted and pissed off to hear those words.  Now the worst part, the side dish.  We ordered potatoes au gratin much to my chagrin.  I was leaning toward the sauteed mushrooms as I enjoyed them immensely in the past, but she wanted the potatoes.  They were disgusting.  A pan full of thick sliced potatoes was heavily coated with a 1\/2 "" thick layer of cheese.  Above the cheese was a 1\/8"" to 1\/4"" layer of oil that had seperated from the cheese.  I ate two bites of the $11 side and vowed not to take another bite. The potatoes were mushy and I realized it was not worth the caloric intake.

The best part of the evening was the slice of chocolate cake that was decorated beautifully with Marney's name on it for a nice personal touch.  With tax and tip our dinner was $165.  I don't mind spending that kind of money on a delicious meal, but I feel like it should have been $50.  I received a call from a hostess the following morning to ask how ""my experience was.""  I told her that it was going to be my last.  I explained my previous dining experiences and that this one left a bad taste in my mouth.  She said that she had heard similar comments from diners that evening and that she would like to ""earn our business again,"" but didn't expand on that.  I believe she had an opportunity to win me back at that point, but the phone line got quiet and then she thanked me for coming in.  Sorry City Hall, looks like Donovan's will move back to the top of the list.",Restaurant
_okvUUfN7CDnzsrP3ib6_w,iwDP-y8NJG3Vem2z242LDg,oJSa5HCiZXKLXxggQmecEQ,2011-09-03,"GOOD LORD I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is awesome and no I don't work there, nor am I affiliated with them in any way except that I did have the fortune of dining here recently and it was really, REALLY good.

First off, I kind of like that the location isn't among the hustle and bustle of other downtown areas, such that parking was NOT at all a problem. Secondly, the interior: nothing pretentious there--it's simple in its own way but very lovely nonetheless. The crowd that night was an assortment: professional, young-ish ilk, some families with older children (my guess; I always like to construct my own characters).

The service is GREAT from the moment you walk in--which, if you don't get there at opening (6pm) or soon thereafter, I'd suggest you make a reservation. I think they have two seating times. The host greeted then seated us--standard. The waitress however, was something else. She brought us our drinks along with glasses of water and a pitcher, but kept coming back to fill our glasses with water when we were low! I thought that was totally over-the-top but in a good way. Personally though, I feel bad that someone should go out of their way to do this when the pitcher is available for us to pour ourselves. FAB service. Now the food...

Their menu does vary on certain items depending on the night that you go (maybe also to do with what is available at the market that day?) but certain things (ie, burrata, warm olives, spaghetti, chorizo) seem to be staples, and rightfully so~ 

We were a party of two and started with the burrata and bone marrow. Judging from some of the pics that fellow YELPers have posted of their dishes, it seems even the presentation of their food varies from night to night. For example, the burrata we got was this jumbo lump on top of really thin (think Melba Toast-thin) toasted slivers of bread. The whole thing was drizzled in super-yum olive oil and I'm guessing a sprinkle of salt because after a while I did detect that feeling I get when I eat something on the salty side. EVERYONE was ordering the burrata, and it's no real mystery why. We also got to enjoy the bone marrow which also came with some crispbread-like crunchiness. The bone was oozing with a generous amount of marrow and had such a distinct, pure beefy flavour to it that I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven! (If you've ever had homemade kom-tang with just the right amount of seasoning, you'll know what I'm talking about and if you even know what kom-tang is, chances are you have had the homemade stuff and know damn well what what I'm talking about!) There was so little bread to work with that we didn't mind slathering on the marrow. There was even a decent amount of meat on the bone that stewed so long that it practically fell off with a slight tap and landed in our mouths. 

I walked in there starving as I was looking so forward to this meal and to be quite honest, the starters alone would have tied me over for some time. But alas, who stops there?? We then got our mains: the spaghetti, which were so fresh and perfectly cooked--the pasta itself was not the round kind you buy dry in the supermarket but square and had the perfect texture. The sauce was deelish but the dish was not presented with all the fanfare as it appears in some of the pics that have been posted, but it's all good. At $18, it was probably the least expensive main. We also got the sweet pea agnolotti with chunks of lobster strewn about. When I saw it was a handful of pieces of pasta, I wanted to cry because I knew it would be good, but it was surprisingly filling (though we did share everything so I'm sure the spaghetti and salty-ish burrata helped)!!! 

We could have done without dessert but shared a budino (Italian pudding) anyway and certainly without regret! The smooth texture of the pudding had just the right amount of flavour and sweetness, and also contained big pieces of salty sponge toffee that went so well with the rest of the dessert! If this is on the menu when you go, TRY IT!

I walked out of there very happy that night, and their service is definitely something that will set them apart from some of the nonsense you see at some of these new restaurants. The rustic, Italian-inspired dishes we had were ALL very good and highly recommended. Everything was super-fresh and tasty! Don't be fooled by the not-huge portions and give a few different things a try--you will not be disappointed. There was nothing about this place that was a let-down, and I sincerely hope that their success continues. As we were leaving at about 8:30pm, there were hordes of people lined up by the entrance, salivating and waiting for their turn to grab a table. The next time I go, I am definitely going to be one of them!",Restaurant
g9WIiYtzQdHd3THGO_seSQ,AedJ9prHZvr3wBJ_eTsd8g,b7wUWVV01xaa7E0FUNMDiw,2016-08-12,"Asian fusion isn't exactly my cup of tea, but I can't say enough good things about my food experience here at Dai Lo.

I came here with 3 other girlfriends on a Wednesday night; we couldn't make reservations because we were too last minute, and while walk-ins are welcome, the only spot we managed to get was on the patio (and quite possibly on the hottest day of the year!).

We interacted with a few waiters over the course of the night and I got to say everyone I met was a little be quirky in their own way. Nothing bad or negative, just interesting personalities. 

Onto the real star of the show though, which was the food. It was an absolute delight dining here. I was very, very surprised by how tasty the food was, even for ""asian food"" (which I've already mentioned I""m not that big of a fan of).

Some highlights:
- crispy octopus tacos (5\/5): phenomenal! wasn't expecting the jicama taco, but it gave such a good crunch and texture to the dish. the octopus was very tender. the dish came together with all of its flavours and texture very nicely - after our entire meal, i decided to order another serving of this to finish the meal.

- fried watermelon (4.5\/5): this dish just sounds out of whack. having that said, i don't what it is about it, but the combination of flavours just worked. the watermelon had a little bit of a batter to it, and because it's fried, the inside was on the softer side (kind of like boiled wintermelon when it's in chinese soup, if you know what i mean...). pairing watermelon and pork floss and a hint of freshness from (what i believe to be) basil was just fantastic.

- ontario pea dumplings (3\/5): this was recommended to us by our waiter. i didn't love this dish; i like my dumplings to have substance to it, but the pea filling is slightly on the softer side and same with the dumpling skin. i really liked the sauce though, and truffle is never a bad idea ;)

- truffle fried rice (3.5\/5): my one loved this dish, and i think it was alright. when i think of fried rice i usually think of really greasy and oily late night eats after going out, and this (probably because is a much elevated version of the aforementioned), just didn't quite seem to hit the spot. i didn't particularly care for the addition of truffle, but there was good texture in there (got a lot of ""hard rice"" or crispy bits from the pan, which i like a lot).

- peking duck breast (4.5): this duck breast was on pointtt! very well cooked, so so so succulent. the sauce (or at least what was left of it; read point down below) was incredible in flavour. the only thing that sucked was that it came with so few pieces of that each of the 4 of us were only able to have 2. there was also a lot of other stuff\/filler on the display, i.e. crispy wonton skins, coconut nuts, cooked zucchini. would be nice if there was more duck :D also, the xo dipping sauce for the wontons was extremely delicious.

Also, unfortunately, as the waiter was placing a plate on the table, he had tilted it and the dark sauce\/juice from the peking duck breast splashed over my white dress :'( They handled it quite well offering me soda water\/tide to go\/his business card to expense dry cleaning - I'm just wishing it didn't happen in the first place, womp womp. I was so focused on cleaning my dress that when the last three dishes\/main courses arrived, I didn't get to eat any of it until it got all cold.

Although this restaurant absolutely shocked me and I loved nearly all the flavours and spices that were used, I gotta say, us girls left hunnn-gryyy! I think the food is priced too high for the portions it's offering. I wouldn't rate it as a restaurant giving you the most bang for you buck, but it's a very nice treat. 

Dai Lo - have you considered reviewing the pricing on your menu? I bet there'd be a lot\/even more regulars coming through that door (myself included!)!

I was asked if a student could watch, I was fine with that. I didn't think about it during visit but after I was worried thinking that Dr. did nothing but sit in the room while the student did my ENTIRE exam. Now I feel as if my test was probably not done right. I also had a red bump on my breast that had been there for a few weeks, I showed Dr. Brass. She thought it was ring worm, I knew it wasn't & she gave me a cream & told me to let her know if it didn't go away. While I was there I asked that they also test for STD's just to be safe, as I always do when getting a PAP. Come to find out she never made notes to test for that so it was never done at the lab. I wasn't going to make a big deal about it so I just never said anything. My second visit was due to finding out I had a fibroid\/polyp in my uterus from my primary care doctor and was told to follow-up with my gnyo. I called to make the appt & was told her first opening was a month away, the women on the phone thought I shouldn't wait that long so she told me to hold & see if she could do anything. She said she could get me in that day in a few hours. So I took a half day off of work and went to my appt. I was scared & concerned what was going on in my body because I had to Google it. I printed out the info & it told me what questions to ask. After waiting 45 mins past my appt, I was given a sheet and told to remove my pants. I figured this meant she was going to examine me. Dr. Brass comes in & asks me what is going on. I tell her about what I was told and I was here to follow up to figure out my options and what all this meant. She then asks why I have a sheet on & not a gown, I said I am not sure that is just what I was told. She opens the door and starts yelling at the assistant girl of why she would not put me in a gown, tells me that the assistant is going to start over then she will come back in. She could have easily just given me a gown. I put the gown on, she comes back in with a student. She then tells me well we will do surgery. I was stunned & told her I really would like to watch it & just want to know what happens if I watch it & what happens if I do surgery. Once I told her I didn't want to do surgery she became a horrible pissed off person. I had to basically force information out of her. I ask, if I watch it how long would we wait to re-test & do another ultra sound. She says ""a year"", which I thought was way too long (my old gyno who I returned to told me the same thing, we will re-test in 4-6 months). Then I ask, what happens if I do surgery, are their possible complications like me not being able to have children? I am 28 and never had one yet & that is a very important thing to me. She says, ""this is so small there would be no complications, it is not huge the things you are reading, are about huge fibroids"". I was in shock. I start to tear up because I am frustrated & I am not being comforted or made to feel like I am being informed or supported here. She asks me why I looked confused. I said because you are acting as if you are pissed that I am here. She tells me, ""well I am pissed, my front desk didn't tell me you were coming in today"". I said, ok well I am here and I need to understand what is going on, I don't feel like you are giving me info to better understand. I want to know what happens if I do surgery. ""do you know you are talking in circles, do you""? I told her well it is only because I want to understand my options & you're very hostile. ""Well if you want to do surgery then we will discuss that in the next visit"". Why not tell me now instead of me paying another co-pay just to be told what happens. ""You won't remember all this"". I said I will. With an attitude explains the surgery. Asks me why I am crying, she thinks I have an emotional issue & hiding info from her because my Dr. test me for STD's. ""Did you have a new partner""? No been with same guy 8 years ""Then why all the testing?"" Because you never know and I wanted to eliminate them for the reason's I was having female issues & full body rash. She yells at me, I am not telling her things and that I must have some emotional thing going on & I must think he was cheating. I looked at the student, she was staring at the wall. I was pissed at this point, I then talk about the last I was in you gave me cream and told me if the bump on breast didn't go away to let you know. She looks at it from a distance and says, ""it looks like a stretch mark"". I say it is not a stretch mark it is a bump and it has been there for almost 2 months now. She touches it and says ""see a dermatologist then"". She then says ok we are done call and schedule if you want to do the surgery. I called the manager next day & got a refund, they apologized &said that was not her normal manner.I am now reading theses reviews on here and seems it is her norm.",Beauty
MTiIrfuJ1w0WC3PE2quhTw,-IT3GtJxE4GByxodo4J_wA,B70iTJjcPkuYn8ouUewWgw,2012-11-14,"We came to Gusto for a quick catchup dinner with one of our junior high school classmate during my bachelor trip here in Toronto. It was a busy Sunday night but we were lucky to find a table for 6.  I debated profoundly on rating for a 3 or 4, but at the end it was the many little flaws that had tip the scale.

To begin, Gusto was a spacious restaurant with seating available both indoor and out, and a base hosting for additional tables. Yet the owner must had been too greedy by filling up the place with tons of tables and chairs over the capacity limit and at the same time forgetting about the open kitchen and bar that took about half of the inner restaurant. Thus, customers were cramped at the tiny tables with elbows almost touching elbows. For the night, our group of 5 guys and a pregnant mom was gathered around a small rectangular table, sitting on high stool like chairs with no backs to hang our heavy coats which we had to stuff in to the compartment below the surface of our table creating such inconvenience. 

Being a Chinese and by far foreign to the Italian culinary arts besides the usual common red\/white sauces, bread and cheese and olive oil, pasta, pizza, and the pitiful not-even a handful of wines that I knew of, the few excellent restaurants that I had the pleasure of visiting in NYC had given me the precious insight on the fact that the physical size of serving dish were usually large regardless of the portion within. Gusto was no different as tradition and fashion would had to be followed, practiced, and copied. Before coming to downtown, earlier in the day we had a huge and fantastic dim sum brunch at a Chinese restaurant near our hotel area, and thus we were kind of conservative on the dinner choices. Unlike the other companions who had chosen two orders of linguini, a lasagna special, and two pizza pie, I ditched entree and instead chose calamari and a cocktail called tempest. After the usual round of bread with olive oil given by the restaurant, our food arrived in numerous white plates. Both the lasagna and linguini dish size had taken more than 2\/3 of the table's surface area, and the two pizza pies (about 10"" each) took almost all of the remaining space. At this point I would have patted myself on the back for only choosing an appetizer and a drink. But no, as I had stated before where fashion would need to be copied and followed. The golden rings of sliced calamari heaped up in a tiny pile that was served in a tiny little white rice bowl along with a spicy mayo-based sauce for dipping. To make presentation pretty, the chef mounted both sauce and meat on a wooden little tray that you see commonly used in Japanese restaurants when serving individual sushi and sashimi, and completed the dish with a streak of chocolate sauce for garnish. So what could have been compact was now a size of regular dish that would need to compete for space, awful.

As everything in Gusto was cooked fresh from open kitchen, there would be no complain from me in that department, but yet amid all the pizza and pasta that I shared with my friends, none seemed to stand out, and tasted plain and average to me. The pastas were a little undercooked for my definition of al dente, and for the way over priced pizzas the pies were so thin with thickness equivalent of two dimes stacked together. Living here in NYC, I had way much better pizzas and much cheaper pricing. We finished our dinner with 2 orders of a combination of lemon tart, chocolate flan, and chocolate covered cream puff. The square blocked lemon tart was excellent, bursting with sharp sweet lemon flavor, and the chocolate flan was gooey with rich and delicious chocolate. The puffy puffs were average, having had much better ones at so many Japanese bakeries.

Many of you, after reading this review, might say that I am too picky and too harsh on Gusto. But hey if I am to pay for meal and service, then I expect to receive the best of the best to get my money worth.",Restaurant
CXi-HCWeFQ5QykQWUz-S-A,qBB7MPUrjeMW0aQBpk_jdA,AHIqvHCHD38xbB0QVsv70w,2015-01-28,"I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THIS REVIEW: 

I made a yelp account just to write this review, if that tells you anything.

I was in a lot of pain, very stressed out about an upcoming endeavor I am pursuing, and called countless places to try to get in that day. If you're anything like me you typically gravitate towards a salon setting, just because it seems ""nicer"" and more ""spa-like"".

What I didn't realize is that salons actually are legally bound by a cosmetology license, and not a medical one, which explained to me why my salon massages never quite lived up to ones performed by a facility specializing in massage. Salon massage therapists cannot legally do deep-tissue massages, which is only allowed by a practice that exists under a MEDICAL license, and not a COSMETOLOGY one. 

Dee was so warm, I was almost overwhelmed the very minute I walked in the door. I explained to her that I had just recently gotten a massage from a salon in Fairlawn, (Lavita, in which the woman talked through the entire massage, did not focus on any of the areas in which I had pain, and even spoke openly with the receptionists about what crappy tips she had gotten that day: very unprofessional)

Dee told me that her fibromayalgia patients were always blown away by the 4 Hands massage that she offers (she is one of three practices in Ohio offering this service!!).

Of course hesitated; it was my first time at this venue, I was a little daunted definitely. I had never had a woman and a man work on me at the same time. She left the choice to me, and did not once try to push a sale. It was extremely clear to me that this woman was not after my money (unlike the receptionist in Fairlawn who was trying to offer me bulk packages at a discounted rate as I'm trying to check out), she GENUINELY wanted me to experience something that had ended pain for so many people who shared this complicated disease with me. 

I finally obliged, scared. I was scared! But OH MY GOD people you have NO IDEA what this massage did for my life. I think the low point of my life was when it ended, I almost cried, I was so sad! She told me to take my time getting up, since many people were very relaxed after this service. ""Yeah sure, whatever, I thought, and went to jump up. My head was spinning, I had to lay back down. The only part of me that they did not rub kinks out of was my face, which was the only thing on my entire body that I could feel.

Do you know what it's like to feel nothing for the first time? It's something you can't really know until pain vanishes, and then you realize: Oh, so this is what it feels like to be normal. 

I COULD BREATHE!!! LIKE I HADN'T BREATHED IN YEARS, AND I'M 23 YEARS OLD!   This natural high had me so dizzy I had to take a minute before I could get in my car to drive. They got me some water, and we just chilled in the lobby, laughing and talking, these two people were so personable and sweet. They talked with me about their travels to Nicaragua to treat people with their services. 

But if I wasn't sold yet, they rang me up at the register and overcharged me: the total had about 16% tax. Numb as a zombie, I handed my card over. This woman could have easily duped me in my transient state, but ""Oh!"" she said ""I owe you eight dollars, I'm so sorry, I overcharged you on tax!"". She handed me a stack of bills back apologetically. 

Wow. If you want:
1.Quality, top-notch service that is worth every cent 
2.Good, honest practitioners who aren't ever going to try to force you to spend extra money, sell services, or complain about tips 
3. A genuine experience that is targeted at YOUR well-being, and not the business-owners'

Go see Dee and Brett in Medina. They are fantastic, good-hearted and honest hard-working people. It's been one day since my first 4 Hands Massage, and I'm still feeling the incredible benefits. I was considering dry needling or acupuncture to try to loosen the knots in my back. Now I know that these people are capable of helping me in a way that is entirely pain-free. 

What an experience. It is like none other I have ever witnessed, and I've gotten so many massages in my lifetime. Nothing compares to this one. THIS PLACE IS NUMBER ONE! YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IT OUT!",Beauty

My mom, aunt & cousin arrived here on a Sunday afternoon after a long return road trip from a funeral in Texas (stopped in Phoenix as a midway point). First off the owners did a wonderful job of renovating what was formerly an old motel or apt bldg. The fountain\/water feature in the front walkway & the lovely aromatherapy (reminded me of the Ms.Meyers Basil scent) in the lobby set the tone for how relaxing this place is. The front desk person was happy and greeted us immediately with a smile, simple and fast check in. She let us know about the free snacks\/sodas, Breakfast Vouchers and the daily free Happy Hour (Only Wine is free) at the Rooftop Lounge\/Deck. The seating was comfortable and lighting\/ambiance was chill.
The pool and the hot tub are also a great amenity here, comfortable temperatures and very clean. The hot tub is the same width as the pool, so it allows multiple groups of guests to comfortably enjoy it while watching the waterfall\/glass feature. 
Our room was clean and had fun colorful paintings and some accented blue walls to brighten up any mood. Since the hotel is not in the middle downtown or off of a main street, it was quiet and we had no problems with late night noise. The beds and pillows were comfortable, there is also a white noise option on the radio by the bed, so that you can fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean (just keep hitting the button until you find one that suits you).
Also, they provide plenty of soap, shampoo & conditioner in classy silver colored wall dispensers. All of the products are hypoallergenic, including the hand wash soap and lotion. My aunt loved it, since she has extremely sensitive skin and most hotel toiletries irritate her skin, not the case here! :) 
The hotel restaurant Tranquilo is excellent!!! All of the ingredients are fresh and the chefs know how to cook them. At dinner our server was Pedro and he was chipper, friendly and knowledgeable. He even know what we were asking for when we asked him if we could get some Chiles Toreados (toasted jalapenos) on the side with a bit of beans & rice. Getting the special side was easy and the kitchen staff\/cooks made the jalapenos just the way we like them. For my meal I ordered the Steak Special: 100% grass fed Rib Eye Steak (medium rare) w\/Chimichurri sauce on top of grilled vegetables, served in a skillet. The meat was tasty and easy to slice into (like butter) and not over cooked, the vegetables were also cooked perfectly tasty and still slightly crisp. The sauce was merely an accent and not over powering at all. 
My mom ordered the Chicken Mole and again it was cooked perfectly, juicy not dry and the mole sauce was spicy and not overly sweet like most. My aunt ordered the Fish Special, Salmon over vegetables. Again the salmon was cooked to perfection, slightly crispy on the outside, done on the inside but not dry at all. The vegetables were great as well. 
Since we all finished our entire meals, we sadly had no room for desert.
We also had Breakfast here as our room came with a $12.50 voucher for each person. There is no complimentary coffee in the lobby but you can purchase coffee or tea to go for $3.00 plus tax. The coffee and black tea were both quality, my mother and I are kind of picky about both. For breakfast I ordered the Chilaquiles with Chorizo instead of the listed Chicken or Vegetables, the Chilaquile sauce with the Chorizo made this dish the favorite of the morning. Rich with some spice but not overpowering, I could still taste the egg, chips and Oaxaxa cheese. My aunt had Eggs & Chorizo with beans and my Mom had the Huevos Rancheros served in a skillet both were very tasty with just enough spice. I also ordered the Greek Yogurt & Quinoa granola (to feel a little bit healthy), definitely worth going over my voucher amount. The fruit was freshly cut and the yogurt was soooo creamy. Our server at breakfast was named Fuego (obviously a nickname :), cheery and attentive. 
We didn't have time to check out the spa...but we will next time. The Clarendon is now the only hotel I will be staying whenever I'm in Phoenix.",Beauty

I parked and entered and found the ambiance pleasant. I would recommend some blinds for the atrium seating so that during sunset your customers arent in a greenhouse.
 The server was exceptionally polite and helpful and attentive. He even escorted me to the ladies room and advised me they were unisex. He was just a peach! 
The unisex bathroom however, reeked of urine. There's a reason ladies prefer their own lavatory! 
Structurally speaking, and this is being really picky, when you wash your hands in their unique sink, the faucet sits so low to the basin that your hands come close to dragging in the dirty basin that others have used. Icky. 
Once the last minutes of happy hour grew near though, our server's attention, understandably, waned. They got slammed. Perhaps a drink runner for that last hour of happy hour would have aided us in getting our drinks BEFORE closing out AND paying our tabs. 
The food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd, they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections. They fell flat.
 I then ordered the olive medley and a bread loaf which they purportedly bake on site. The olives were plentiful and tasty. The bread however was burnt. It had big empty holes in the middle so the amount of bread was slight. 
Our cocktails were also unique, however some of them fell flat while others were so immensely strong we had to send 1 or 2 back. 
The reason i will never return to St. Francis isnt even any of the above although it contributes. But the icing, the cherry on top was departing the joint. 
Now I get why these hipster trendspots hire valet companies. The need to ""accommodate"" the customer who drives, is hopefully met by an attendant who crams your car into a packed lot meant for only about 16 cars. 
When I arrived there was no valet to squeeze me into my spot behind the beer truck, next to the dumpster, near the gas tanks. But when I left my car was again blocked in, this time by other cars which had been sandwiched between my rear and the cars in the lanes behind mine. 
it took quite the effort and my passenger getting out to guide me, to get out of my spot safely.
On my exit, backwards, through the lot and around a corner, only then did I notice the valets. One was running about, the other seemed  a bit oblivious, flustered. I rolled down my window, and said ""You guys have to be kidding the way you block people in, "" I said smiling, trying to make light of the situation. 
""Most people know."" he replied.
""Know what?"" I asked.
""To let us know.""
Confused, I wasnt sure what he meant. 
My passenger said ""You guys blocked her in and she could barely get out.""
The attendant responded, ""Look lady, that's the name of the game.""
My passenger said ""What game is that?""
He replied sarcastically, ""Well if you've ever been to St. Francis...""
""I have not"" I cut him off as he continued to try to explain that we should have known to come let them know so they could move cars to let us out. 
1st of all, from my spot I couldnt see that there was even a valet set up.
2nd of all- to get your attention then to wait for you to rubix cube cars around would have inconvenienced me, YOUR CUSTOMER AND THE PATRON OF THE RESTAURANT THAT HIRES YOUR DUMB ASS TO CAR JOCKEY! 
To which i replied ""I have not been here before and I wont be back now"" to which he replied
""Well good "" and rolled his eyes.
St Francis- the valet is the first and last impression of your restaurant. And that is why, more than anything else, I wont be back and I try to avoid places that use valets b\/c they are too cheap to buy extra land to accommodate the numbers their trendy new spot might bring in. Additionally 9and not in your case since our drinks were priced for happy hour) my money that pays for inflated bar and food prices should cover me for FREE PARKING and not to have to pay or even tip some juvenile dipshit whom I wouldnt let drive my car if he was my own relative!",Restaurant
hvHKvZkqx9aI6GsQ5TqsyQ,-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,NlGDKsTOLKyHJ0mgS_gWJQ,2011-03-06,"I love BBQ, so I was VERY nervous as I sat down at BB King's Blues Club since chain restaurants rarely serve the kind of BBQ that is the focus of my dreams for weeks. 

Now, even though BB King's was not the best BBQ I've ever had (you have to go to holes in the wall restaurants that are strewn across the south to find true BBQ joy), for what it is worth, BB King, you made a valiant effort!

I have eaten the following:
Pile of Nachos with BBQ Pulled Pork
Hickory Burger
Carolina BBQ Salmon
BBQ Chicken
BBQ Ribs
Baked Beans

2 visits and I was satisfied each time. The first time the service was a little shaky but quickly improved as the night went on. Even though it was busy, our waters were rarely empty and the napkins kept on coming! The second time we went there our server was wonderful. She was very friendly and GREAT at suggesting dishes.

First Visit: The Pile of Nachos were mediocre, nothing amazing. The BBQ pork on the nachos was pretty good, and the jalepenos on the side definitely helped the matter! take this review with a grain of salt since I'm not a huge fan of cheese sauce - I like the real stuff!

The BBQ chicken\/ribs: I'm sensitive about my BBQ sauce. I don't want too much on the chicken or ribs, not too sweet, not too much of a vinegar punch and with either a subtle or boot-knocking kick. BB King's sauce may have been a little sweet, but they do caramelize their meats PERFECTLY with the sauce! The ribs and chicken had a good bark on them and none of the food was greasy or too fatty. No major spice here, but the bark makes up for it. The baked beans that came on the side of this dish were a little sweet as a side dish for an already sugary dish, but they had a nice subtle smokey flavor and a great texture. 

Hickory Burger: My boyfriend at this burger, so I can't tell you exactly how it tasted, but we both have an incredible, insatiable love for burgers. Coming from Chicago (the Home of Kuma's Korner), we know our burgers, so when the man says it's one of the better burgers he has had since moving to Vegas, it has to be good! He said a lot of it had to do with the sauce and the perfectly cooked medium-rare center. I love it that Vegas still lets you cook your burgers medium-rare! He devoured this burger in record time and looked longingly at the plate after it was gone.

Carolina BBQ Salmon: I saved the best for last. There is food in this world that puts a smile on my face whenever I think about the smell, taste and afterglow. This dish sends a surge of happiness up my spine and smacks my brain around for a few minutes whenever I think about it. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overcooked, rubbery, too raw (even though I wouldn't have minded) or plain. The BBQ sauce on the fish was subtle, definitely not overpowering and once again, the bark made it scrumptious. The best part? They say that it is on a bed of creamed corn. I am sure many people thought of the scary, rubbery substance that would crawl out of the can and unnaturally jiggled in the serving bowl on the dinner table. This was a spicy cream sauce with a dash of corn made even more AMAZING by andouille sausage. If you haven't had andouille sausage, please find a local grocery store that sells it and make some jambalaya or even throw it on the grill. It is SPECTACULAR. This dish had enough calories to last me the entire week, but hey, there's a reason why I work out 6 days a week!

All together, I enjoyed BB King's. I will definitely go there again. The music during my first visit was great. They gave you a free drink voucher if you paid cover to get into the restaurant and you can go to www.restaurant.com and get a discounted $25, $50 or $100 coupon. I would go even without either of those discounts and get that salmon again tonight if my heart didn't shudder at the thought of all that buttery, spicy, savory cream sauce...Mmmm...cream sauce...",Restaurant

Crocchette Pugliesi:  With my dining partner interested primarily in the pizza I was left to decide on opening courses and although the focaccia and arancini sounded tempting it was this pair of fluffy nuggets that won me over; and thankfully they did not disappoint.  Featuring lightly whipped potatoes at outside edge with a lightly crisp coating each of these delectable bites burst with flavor as the interior housed a dense composition of house made Fior di Latte and Prosciutto Cotto.  Served alongside stewed San Marzano tomatoes and a light salad of grape tomatoes and spinach each bite was fresh and balanced - my only complaint being that there wasn't a half-dozen more.

Gnocchi alla sorrentia:  Quite simply, good gnocchi is what every starch should aspire to be in my world and these gnocchi were sublime - each small dumpling so light that it threatened to float off the plate.  A dish so often over\/under-done each of these fluffy balls was simply adorned with simple stewed tomatoes, torn basil, creamy Fior di Latte, and a light dusting of Parmigiano Reggiano before a quick trip to the oven produced a lightly caramelized crust.  If you go, this is a must order - and if I go back I'd love to see if they'd be willing to supplement the Bufala in place of the Fior di Latte.

Bufala DOP:  Less the gourmand than myself but still knowledgeable of food it was suggested by my dining partner that he was going to order the Regina Margherita but more than happy for my suggestions an upsell to the Bufala DOP took little coaxing and while I cannot vouch to the quality of the Regina I can say without a doubt that the $3 fee was worth every penny as the weekly imported Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP Napoli's tangy funk and ethereal mouthfeel was notable in every bite.  Moving next to the crust (offered cut or un-cut by the kitchen in order to stick with tradition,) slow kneaded and just crisp enough on the edges to keep the rim steady and the center wet I particularly enjoyed the low smoky notes and although a bit more blister would have been ideal the simple garnish of unsweetened San Marzanos, Basil, and a touch of Parmigiano Reggiano was precisely what I'd hoped for walking in the door.

Tirolese:  With my colleague ordering the pizza I'd have selected I decided to be a bit more progressive and turned to an equally well constructed pie featuring the same base but subsequently topped with Fior di Latte, Brie, and Speck Alto Adige IGP - a unique imported leg ham first salted and air-dried and then smoked, the flavor harkening notes of sweet, savory, and smoky all at once and perfectly balanced to the acid of the tomatoes by the creamy pairing of cheeses.  Most times a pizza purist when visiting a Neapolitan spot I have to say I may have enjoyed this one even more than the Bufala, though perhaps that simply speaks to the quality of the translucent layer of pork on top.

Semifreddo Alla Mandorle:  No stranger to semifreddo but having never seen it delivered quite like this what arrived to my table was exquisite - a sort of 'ice cream sandwich' but without the ice cream or sandwich.  Featuring a delicate frozen mousse - think whipped cream but frozen - stuffed with chopped figs cooked in honey and rolled in crushed Amaretto Cookie this dessert was the very definition of light and refreshing, a fact furthered by a light drizzle of reduced strawberry and honey plus powdered sugar that made it sweet, but not overly so.

Millefoglie:  Described by some as an Italian Mille Feuille and by others as the hand-held equivalent of a Napoleon this Millefoglie was quite different from the versions I'd experienced in Boston and Philadelphia, but with buttery puff pastry layers juxtaposing layers of pastry cream as well as cream Chantilly plus ample notes of honey and Amarena cherry it would be hard to say this wasn't the best Millefoglie I've ever had.  Far more dense than the semifreddo or a traditional mille-feuille but far less so than most napoleons I'd be hard pressed to describe a dessert I've had that is similar in flavor, though the overall texture was something like croissant meets baklava.

The Verdict:  While some may contest that VPN certification is meaningless and I would tend to agree, if that is what it takes for 'Pomo to get people past the sub-par exterior and into the restaurant then I am all for it.  While perhaps not the best pizza in the Phoenix metropolitan area due to a little place called Bianco the pies at 'Pomo stand up to the best in all but a handful of cities and when you take into account the strength of the rest of the menu I think it likely ranks amongst the ten best Neapolitan joints I've been lucky enough to visit.",Restaurant
7Z5U1rD7AiY4VBpThjeDbQ,jIoO7XmjXfgu0pLLkXI_KQ,yI_QrxrKERNq2efLoowXiQ,2016-01-21,"It's hard to know how to rate the Academy of Beauty Professionals (ABP?). If it were a full service salon I would have given it one star for sure. But these are students, right? I can't hold them to the highest standards. 

Let me start by saying that this is the same location that has previously housed Empire and Martin's, both of which I've used at various times. In comparison, ABP is reeeaaally bare bones. You check in at a desk so small that the appointment book hangs off the edge. The product shelves are about 75% empty. The client chairs are not actually salon chairs but space-age looking desk chairs. Gone are the cabinets holding students' supplies; in their place are plywood shelves and tin cans on wheels. Several areas are bare plywood - not sure if they're waiting for installation or for demolition, but the effect is the same.

The Good:
- The price: $12 for a haircut and style. This is why we come here, after all.
- I got a great haircut. Yay! My long hair became much-neater, medium length hair, and I've received several complements in the weeks since.
- The student was ready for me within five minutes of my appointment time. (The previous school, Empire, apparently didn't cover promptness and students were often 15-20 minutes late.)
- The student made absolutely sure that she knew what I wanted, including showing me pictures and conferring with her instructor.
- She did a good job washing my hair - gentle, right temperature water, thorough.
- It only took an hour and a half. If that sounds like a crazy long time, let me explain that the last time I was here with long hair it took two and a half hours for a TRIM. That was when it was Empire. 

The Bad:
- The chairs are SO uncomfortable. Desk chairs are indeed adjustable - but they are adjusted so the student can reach my head, not so that I can sit comfortably. Desk chairs are made for sitting at a desk, not for perching with my feet off the floor. There was no foot rest. It was pretty much impossible to sit up straight, hard to cross my legs, and painful to lean back and ""relax."" 
- The, ah, bedside manner of both student and instructor were lacking. The student did not utter a single word beyond necessary instructions, and the instructor mostly barked while she pushed my head around.
- While there were only a couple of other customers, the place was packed with students having what amounted to a slumber party, doing each other's hair and nails and gossiping - and not always on topics appropriate for the public.
- The music sounded like it came from Z104. I know, it's a matter of taste and some people will consider that a positive. But hey, it's my review.
- When I was done I had hair EVERYWHERE, and not just those tiny little bits that are so hard to control. There were whole hunks down my shirt, as if she snipped and dropped the whole mess right down my collar. Several times. There was even hair on the front of my neck, like three days' worth of stubble. I found a line of hair across the seat of my car, and my shower floor that night was downright fuzzy. Why did we bother with the cape again?
- The ""style"" was minimal and I left with wet hair. In January.

So, ultimately, 3 stars because I got a good cut for a good price. If you don't mind a little discomfort or inconvenience, this is a great bargain. It's better quality than Cost Cutters and the like. If you're used to fancy salons and expect comfort and professionalism along with your quality haircut, don't bother.",Beauty

We've purchased multiple bedroom sets, a kitchen table and chairs, and most recently a mattress.  We chose to stick with Levin over the years because of the knowledgeable and friendly sales staff at this location.  We walk in and they remember my name even if it's been a year since they've seen us last - it's amazing and it shows that they truly value our business.  I don't feel they are pushy at all as some have stated.  Yes, they are quite thorough and want to make sure you have the proper accessories and applicable insurances to maintain your products and ensure they last a good deal of time.  The delivery teams have been a positive experience for the most part over the course of our decade of dealings - one late delivery and one other delivery where parts were missing.  Both were not a big issue and resolved quickly and professionally. 
Our bedroom sets are going on almost 8 years now - they are fantastic and we have had no issues with them at all.  We have found them to be incredibly durable even under the test of two small, yet very energetic children. Completely satisfied with the quality and value for our money spent.
The kitchen table still looks really good after a few years of daily use but we made the mistake of getting a softer wood top and the first time our school-aged child did her homework on it... If you ever want to know what 8x4 is you can simply use our kitchen table as a cheatsheet.  Whoops.  I guess that was a question I forgot to ask the salesperson. I bought the cleaning and polish kit at the same time - it does a nice job.
And our most recent purchase: A King Size Grand Legacy Luxury Firm mattress (it's a store brand made exclusively for Levin) and to say it has been a complete disappointment would be a huge understatement.  This thing is awful!!  Within the first year it was already less comfortable than the 12 year old mattress it replaced! It has a 20-year warranty so I called my salesperson to see what could be done. I explained to him it was uncomfortable.  I told him that it was not meeting our expectations. I asked if we could reselect a different mattress. Instead, he sent out a man with a small tool to determine the 'saggyness'. The tool showed it was pretty darn 'saggy' but not quite saggy enough to be covered under the Levin Furniture warranty for replacement. But good news - We can call Levin every six months for the remainder of the 20-year warranty and they'll kindly send out the man with the 'sag-o-meter' to see if it's saggy enough yet to be replaced. This guarantee game Levin has insisted on playing reminds me of the 1995 classic 'Tommy Boy' where Tommy says:
 ""Here's the way I see it, Ted. Guy puts a fancy guarantee on a box 'cause he wants you to feel all warm and toasty inside."" ... ""Because they know all they sold ya was a guaranteed piece of sh*t. That's all it is, isn't it? Hey, if you want me to take a dump in a box and mark it guaranteed, I will. I got spare time. But for now, for your customer's sake, for your daughter's sake, ya might wanna think about buying a quality product from me."" 
Meanwhile, my wife and I do not get a good nights sleep and often wake up aching and sometimes we'll sleep on the couch (not purchased from Levin) to get a good nights sleep.

 I wrote this review today for two reasons:
Firstly, the fact that I continue to contemplate replacing a, what I consider to be, still new mattress that cost thousands of dollars has infuriated me.
Secondly, to ensure my family, friends, and fellow Yelpers do not have to deal with the disappointment that this final purchase at Levin has caused me.",Shopping

We arrived a little past our reservation but we were promptly seated in the outdoor seating area next to the waterfall, which I might add was very beautiful and totally complimented the dining experience. They put on little shows for you as soon as the sun sets, they also have lights reflecting onto the water that change in color. So pretty! =)

APPETIZER
SAUTEED FOIE GRAS w\/ Grilled Pineapple, Brioche Toast and Blackberry Jam- Oh what a dish this was, the foie gras was perfectly seared (not burned, like the last foie gras I had). The pineapple added a nice contrast to the foie gras, at first I wasn't too sure it'd be a good combination BUT it was. Also the blackberry jam complimented the foie gras very well.

I'M GOING TO NEED MORE WATER
42OZ CHILI RUBBED DOUBLE RIBEYE- Like Cherylynn N. mentioned, this dish was featured on Food Networks ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" so we had fairly high hopes for this dish. SO DISAPPOINTING,  the chili rub was way too overpowering, too salty, too much seasoning, IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH and too much of something can't always be good.  I found myself having to drink a couple of glasses of water because the rub was too overbearing and took away from the steaks flavor! I'm shocked that this would be on ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" because this didn't come anywhere close to being the best thing I ever ate. Oh, might I add that our steak was OVERCOOKED!!

SIDELINERS
BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED CORN, PARMESAN CREAMED SPINACH, MAC 'N CHEESE, FINGERLING POTATOES w\/ Green Beans & Bacon- Our of all the sides, I thought the mac n' cheese was the best. Why? Because I like mac n' cheese, that good enough for ya? =X 

THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR DESSERT
FUNNEL CAKE & STRAWBERRIES w\/ Anglaise, Salty Caramel and Fudge Sauce- THANK GOD FOR DESSERTS! This was the best out of all the dishes we had. The funnel cake was soft and warm and when dipped in any of the 3 dipping sauces was like taking a bite of heaven. 

HI, YES WE'RE STILL HERE! (SERVICE)
So, our waitress was MIA more than half the time. I don't remember her checking on us at all but I watched her multiple times go to tables where older customers were seated and checked up on them. The only times we saw her was when we placed our orders, when our friend had to complain about his steak because it was WAY OVERCOOKED and when she handed us the bill. A restaurant in the Wynn lacks service in their restaurants, I'm shocked. 

OVERCOOKED
Ah, now you must be wondering about the overcooked steak. If not, YOU BETTER START TO WONDER!! =X jk. All joking aside, our friend had to send his steak back because his steak was cooked well-done instead of medium-rare. How in God's name does a steakhouse overcook a steak? How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand! 

Our waitress then asked our party if everyone's steak was cooked to their liking but she said it in a tone, a tone like ""UGH F%^&, ANYONE ELSE??"" *flips the bird* WHATEVER LADY.

CONCLUSION
Never coming back here, I'm so disappointed. The restaurant is a beautiful one but beauty can't mask what's truly inside and what's truly inside, an MIA waitress and overcooked steaks. The foie gras, dessert and enchanting waterfall could not save this review from being 2 stars because I didn't come here for either one of those things. I came here for a good steak and that's NOT what I got, all I got was a bag full of disappointment.",Restaurant
BoYqlv3OgXzOON_U9firYw,-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,Jt28TYWanzKrJYYr0Tf1MQ,2011-11-10,"The Cabo Wabo Cantina is another one of those tourist traps along the Strip...but then again, isn't Vegas one big tourist trap?  Come here if you're interested in some mediocre-to-average Mexican food and some good tequila cocktails - unless you have a strong aversion to very bad service and an unprofessional wait staff.  In my opinion: YMMV depending on your expectations and the mood of the waitperson.

Pros:
Party atmosphere
People watching
Strip location
Good tequila cocktails
Free shots for outgoing-types

Cons:
Quality of ingredients and taste of food
Wait staff
Wasted time (long wait for everything)

Let's start with the good: nice Strip location with a lot of foot traffic, which means you'll have plenty of people watching opportunities.  If you are the type to ""do anything"" and cut loose, then you might get a free shot, drink, or shirt - they have games or tequila lines throughout the day\/night.  During dinner and throughout the evening, it does get pretty loud and party-like so be advised.  This place definitely isn't for families with kids, seniors, or those with limited mobility.

I went in with a party of 5 - 4 adults and 1 child.  The place is too loud for young children and the outdoor seating has you very close to the tables next to you - good luck trying to squeeze through with a stroller or going with somebody using a cane.  I spent about $100 (including tip) on just food - not bad for a casual bite on the Strip.  You get some decent sized portions for your money and the bartenders aren't shy about making stiff drinks, so it's not that bad if you can tolerate the wait staff and don't expect much from the food.

Our table ordered a few things, including: chicken fajitas, shrimp burrito, nachos, an order of tacos, and of course, drinks.  The food was ok, kind of bland and lacked any excitement despite the loud music blaring throughout the restaurant.  I thought the shrimp was actually good, both the way it was cooked and the marinade, which was a stark contrast to the rest of the items we ordered.  The food isn't up to par with Chevy's but the food is better than Diablo's Cantina; I think both places (Diablo's Cantina and Cabo Wabo) offer a party type atmosphere on the Strip with poor service.  

If you haven't guessed by now, I concur with the other reviews: Cabo Wabo has terrible service.  They have a young and unprofessional staff that couldn't care less about doing their job let alone paying any attention to the customer's needs.  Maybe they'll come by for more drink orders, maybe they'll come by to bring you the check, maybe they'll come back with your credit card - the whole experience makes you feel as if you're gambling.  Either the folks who work here have never eaten at a restaurant or they pick and choose their moments based on personal preferences\/prejudices.  Management is obviously not looking for repeat customers - they are a one and done outfit.  

I think it is odd that most of the ""hip"" joints on the Strip have suspect service and less than average food tied to a decent atmosphere (because of the customers and nothing to do with the actual place).  When compared to similar outfits, the Cabo Wabo is ""ok"" in terms of food, but you really have to check your service expectations at the door.  This place would be a totally different experience with a competent crew, but as it is, I cannot recommend this place to anyone looking for a stress-free meal.  Unfortunately, the Cabo Wabo is completely YMMV based on the whims of your server.",Restaurant

- Price is now raised to $25 \/ entry
- Place is starting to wear down.
- They no longer provide slippers so bring your own or you are sharing the floor with everyone else.
- They are getting lazier and stingier.  Locker had dirty towels and no clean brushes were available.
- Top floor doesn't feel that clean when you have to smell Korean food when you come out of the spa rooms
- I tried their massage service and ended up with a lot of bruise on my neck area.  Thumbs down.
- Next time, I'll look for an alternative.

--- Original Review ---
Decided to try this highly rated spa.
This review is from someone that is new to spas.

The area around this building seems a little dangerous so if you can, please park your car near the building and DO NOT leave any valuables in your car.  I saw glasses in the parking lot which indicates a break-in has occurred or someone got locked in their car.  You also see homeless people roaming around.

The cost is $20 for one entry
You can bulk by 10 passes for $130 ($13 \/ entry)
Spa entry is included with massage prices if you choose to do a massage.
TIP - Bring your own slippers.  Slippers are RECOMMENDED and they charge $5 for them.  You can walk around bare foot, but some of the rooms have burning hot floors.

Greeted by a very friendly lady and she explained the process which there wasn't much of.  Basically, take a shower, go to rooms, take a shower, leave.

They hand you change, towel and a key to your locker.
Entrance for men and women are separate.
Once you go in, you need to take off your shoes

Then you go to your locker where you store your clothes and belongings.

REQUEST - When multiple people come in at the same time, can you guys separate their locker locations?  The people around me were awkwardly saying ""excuse me"" and trying to get by eachother since all our lockers were near by.

The Shower
Yes, people are walking around naked and people get naked as soon as they go in.  Yes, ass naked with their wieners hanging out.  People are all taking shower in the same room and they are chatting in the tub.  It's very strange at first, but you just look away from others and start taking a shower.  They provide a tooth brush, shaving cream and a plastic shaver.  There is a mirror in front of every shower so you can see yourself taking a shower.  There's the usual shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel.  Dry yourself off with the towel before you leave.

Outside the shower, there is everything from dryer, brush, body moisturizer, after shave, etc.

The Sauna
Upstairs (co-ed), there are many rooms.
Exercise Room - A few bike machines and a mirror to stare at yourself.  Would've been nice if they had weights.
Community Room - Many people sitting on massage chair to sleep or watch TV
Ice Room - It's just a giant freezer.  Why?
Iron\/Magnesium Room - Just a hot room to lie down in.
Clay Room - Very hot room and you lie down in a coffin like place
Yoga Room - Seems like a room where you're supposed to meditate
?? Room - A room with a bunch of rocks or beads on the ground to lie down on.  
Work Room - Just a room with a bunch of tables and chairs so you can work or eat.
Wifi is provided.
Water is free.  There is a water dispenser
There is a random korean food menu too I guess in case you want to be there the whole day.

Deep Tissue Massage ($90 for one hour) - It was a-ok.
This was professional.  The masseuse made sure I was covered most of the time and I was at ease.  There was nothing inappropriate and a bottle of water was provided at the end.  The towel against my face felt a bit hard at times.  My neck is a bit bruised, but I think I could've had her adjust the strength.  Not that refreshing and I would probably try something else next time.

Kitchen - Stay away
They have a korean kitchen where you can eat over-priced food.  The food quality isn't bad, but there are many better choices elsewhere off the strip.  Wait if you can.  There was a metal mesh wrapped around my friend's bean sprout which was not safe or acceptable.

All in all, did I enjoy it?
It was a new experience

I had called last week to book a facial as a treat for my birthday. Oddly I had a hard time finding the CC website for the number. Turns out the website is under construction, hmmmm, ok. When I called, the  girl on the other end had no clue as to what types of facials were offered. She had to get the Esthetician on the phone to help me. I asked for a specific facial (microdermabrasion), one that I have been getting for years there. She said they no longer offer it and CC was now an Aveda Salon. Hello, its been an Aveda Salon since I first visited the place 10+ years ago. After much convincing, I booked another type of 1 hour facial and was on my way. 

When I arrived, I walked in past a group of Salon stations with Stylists and clients who felt the need to all turn around and give me the onceover.  I checked in and the receptionist told me to find a place to sit and someone would be with me. Wait a minute...what happened to escorting me back to the quite room where the lights are low, the music is soft and the fresh water and tea is flowing? What happened to the girl handing me my fluffy robe and spa shoes? Was I in the right place? Did the receptionist know I was getting a ""spa"" service or did she think I always walked around Charlotte without a stich of makeup on?  I was a bit confused at this point so I just put myself off to the side and watched the Receptionists stare at me then off into space then at me again, then back into space. 

The Esthetician showed up, introduced herself and walked me past the reception desk, past the salon chairs, the shampoo bowls, the trash can and the mixing area. Once we were at the very back of the salon she ushered me into a small dark room where the soft music\/sound machine was blaring out of her mobile device. She ordered me to get undressed, crack the door open then get under the covers. Odd, I never had to crack the door open before. I strategically positioned myself  so when I cracked the door open I was able to dive under the covers. The bed was NOT heated like it had always been in the past and it was too short  so the extension was pulled out but it tilted down and the Esthetician did not put a foam roller under my knees like in the past as well. 

The facial itself was OK. For all I know she could have put the same cold goop on my face all 3 times and I would have never had known the difference. Because the room was located in the back by the mixing station I had the unfortunate opportunity of overhearing all of stylists conversations. I overheard 2 stylists talking about the ultimate mac and cheese recipe and another talking about her weekend plans of going to a color class then off to Del Frescos with her boyfriend. The way this was going I was more excited about possibly overhearing that ultimate mac and cheese recipe but no such luck. Before the facial was over the Esthetician asked if my towel was on nice and tight because she was going to give me a big final stretch. What towel I asked, I was never directed to put a towel on. She walked around the table and realized the towel had fallen on the floor. She apologized and said we would just skip that part. My 1 hour facial turned out to be 50 minutes.

Upon exiting the room I was smacked in the face with the bright florescent light and my girl standing there empty handed. Normally I am handed a glass of water and taken back the quiet room, which no longer seems to exist. 

I walked up to the Receptionist who was still clueless and waited for about 10 minutes to pay because I was forth in line.  Meanwhile two other employees were up at the desk as well folding towels and never offered to help. 

After frequenting CC for 10+ years I am sad to say I will not be going back. The ""spa' is gone. Carmen no longer offers mani pedis or massages. The entire spa experience is no more.  My suggestion is to take the word Spa out of your company name or you are going to tick off a lot of people.",Beauty
SllNNe3oOVFzbXXgoXpDbw,E5xx_Z_kMAlzbIS72zY8Hw,JXS5uSc0lMPMl_JOkJq6Kg,2015-09-04,"This review pains me to write because I wanted it to be perfect, I wanted to have my bridal moment once I found my dress, but that luxury was not afforded to me.

I recently got engaged and we have excitedly began plans for our wedding. We chose an amazing venue along with a wedding coordinator so the only thing that I would have to worry about is my dress. I was so excited to start my adventure of looking for The dress.

I requested an appointment online a week in advance and came with my mother. We were both beaming with excitement as we walked in and saw aisles of dresses. We were greeted by a wonderful associate, although they had me fill out information onto a piece of paper that I had already done online and I felt like no one knew we had an appointment. She told us to look around the store for what we like and that my Stylist would be over to meet with us shortly. My Stylist came over after a long wait and greeted us. I excitedly told her that this is my first time looking for wedding dresses, that I was not sure what would look great on my body type, and that I needed some guidance. Response: ""Okay, well just look around, see what you like and we can go from there."" What? What do you mean? I am literally asking you for help and you are labeled as a STYLIST. I pep-talked myself to not let any setbacks take me away from the experience so we moved on from there.

We looked around and found quite a few beautiful-looking dresses, but all different styles because we were still lost. I've heard of many women thinking that they know what they want, or see something amazing on the rack, but it looks completely different once they have tried it on. Unlike a few other Yelpers, I did not get measured and had to guess what size dress I would fit in. From there, we were directed to a dressing room near the corner and in the middle of the dressing rooms was another bride with her large party. All of the other associates\/stylists were with her and were eagerly raving about how wonderful she looked in the dress - including my stylist. I am very happy for the other bride, and so happy she found her dream dress and seemed to have had the perfect ""I found The dress"" bridal moment, but I am also a bride and I would have loved to felt the same energy, even if it was from my one stylist.

We waited near the dressing room for awhile, and then our Stylist finally came over to help me set up. It was the original associate who greeted us that got me my corset shape-wear and checked on us, not my Stylist. We were constantly waiting for her to go back and forth between us and the other bride only because she wanted to see what the commotion was all about. She apologized for the wait and said that they were short today, but 1. David's Bridal not having enough associates\/stylists on the schedule should still not impact the guest experience, especially when this was a lie and many associates\/stylists were working that day and 2. Please don't tell me that you were there to help when we see that you were only going over there to join the crowd. She helped me into the dresses just fine, but kept talking about herself more than asking me anything about the wedding or trying to figure out what I want in my dream dress. My mom even joked, ""Hey! Did you forget about my daughter?"" because we spent such long periods just standing there and waiting for her - with an appointment, it should be my time. I felt her energy while dressing me and how she was getting annoyed that I was choosing corset back dresses because she commented on it every time. 

We put on one dress, and I knew that this was the dress for me. I went out to the mirrors, twirled around in my dress and saw one of the most magnificent piece of clothing I have ever put on my body. I contained my excitement and tried on two other dresses just to make sure. When that special dress was put on me for the second time, I teared because I felt beautiful in that dress. My Stylist said that they have a tradition, anytime a bride finds her dress, she has to ring the bell. I rang the bell and was quickly interrupted with ""So, what are we doing?"" meaning am I going to purchase the dress or not. We told her that we would like to think about it and she proceeded to give me a dress ordering timeline sheet. She asked what my wedding colors are and came over with fabric color swatches recommending that I purchase them. I politely declined and she asked if she could call me to follow up on the dress. I told her that October would be good and she then said September would be better so she will call me then. My wedding is not for another 13 months. Unfortunately, while we were looking for MOB dresses my mother overheard the Stylist discussing us to her colleagues, and how we were still deciding and did not purchase the dress. 

To be honest, I love that dress. If it had not been for this experience, I would have purchased it on the spot.",Shopping

He  saw  I was a bit fussy about where I wanted to sit so he invited me to choose the place that I would be most comfortable!!  He was so nice about it.  I asked how long they were there for, he said, family owned for over 50 years, and yes it is true- I had it checked out. My grandparents who are in their 90s said they used to go there all the time when there were dating and first married.  Bread was put on our table nice and warm and really delicious bread!!! The entree was amazing. I was not too hungry so I shared my mate's ( I'm suddenly speaking like a Brit) :)  Cesar Slade, initially I did not want to try the Cesar salad as it is usually made with raw eggs and I was nervous about that- but after him moaning about how good it was I took a bite-. I did not want my own as I was not that hungry and wanted to enjoy my main meal. I do not know what it was called but I asked him if he could make me a Penni with prosciutto and mushroom rose. He said of course!!  My stunning dish came hot and looked so good and smelled amazing, my mouth watered.  It was the best I have ever had and I am truly a restaurant person. I  have dined all over the world except the corner ( assuming there r four) China,  and I have to say it was the most delicious dish I have ever had. My mate had some kind of stuffed pasta with a rose sauce as well. Wow... it was so delicious. He is very fussy about the rose sauce and he said as soon as he took his second bite we are coming back here!!  We kept picking from each others plates!!! The waiter smiled and gave us extra plates if we wanted or needed them. We did not want desert. We asked the waiter anyway, just a tad curious what was for dessert, and he said- chocolate cake mousse and strawberry cheese cake. I said no, my mate who was reading my body language more than my words ordered both.  He is not a chocolate guy but he polished off the chocolate mousse cake within a nano second, as I did with the cheese cake- with his help of course. We     had house wine- which was fair- I think it should be a little lighter, easier  to swallow- easier for non wine connoisseurs, ... maybe we should have  chosen a better wine- but that was more our fault. The service was  amazing, and I mean superior and the most friendly I have ever had. The  meal with all that that I described was about 50.00- approx it is what I sort of saw. My mate  is really weird about me never seeing the bill... but whatever, (I believe  between 50.00 and 60.00-though not sure)     He said to me that could be our new go to restaurant as we live in Montreal- and now I am kind of living in Calgary.     I think the thing I enjoyed so much just before leaving I got to meet his baby, who was more delicious than the meal (an expression). He was so so so cute, I insisted the baby sit on me, the waiter (son of owner)  did not want to disturb us - but it was one of the highlights of my night!!  The cutest baby ever. His wife came over at my insistence and was so much fun to speak with.  As i said this will be my go to place for pasta. ((  SIDE NOTE IT WAS A TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THEY HAD A SPECIAL - PIZZA AND SOME PASTA FOR A REAL DEAL - VERY INEXPENSIVE)  It was a wonderful family owned restaurant and those are hard to come by today.  It is really nice inside - if you judge by the out side - DON'T- its really clean and pretty.",Restaurant
We853schI2SMtGPJHYHYtA,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA,Egn5h9fStvVKcFH7kaLQig,2013-04-27,"3030 has young-professional written all over it. Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.

3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).

One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.

Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.

But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.

Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.

If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.

With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.",Restaurant

Since I work next door, I was hoping to really really love this place. I think we will be back for drinks at the bar, but may pass on dining next time (for a bit atleast).

My husband and I came for dinner with another couple on Saturday after doing the 4th Ward Holiday Home Tour. Probably was around 8pm and we were seated immediately. The setup and decorations are so cute. I love the Edison light bulb look for lighting. I passed this former fountain space every day before Essex was built and am just shocked with what they were able to do with this corner space!

I have heard that the mixed drinks here were outstanding and I can not wait to go back to try some. However, after looking at the bottled wine prices, both couples decided to go with a bottle of wine. I appreciate restaurants that have retail prices for wine bottles! My husband and I decided on a Sangiovese, which was delish.

We started with the Mediterranean trio dip and the gnocchi. The dip was nicely presented. The hummus and babaganoush were just ok but the tomato dip was absolutely fantastic. The gnocchi was pretty good as well.....I am a slightly harsh critic of Italian dishes, as my large Italian family makes pasta from scratch. Thought the gnocchi held up to standards :). After these starters, we ordered the following:
-Short rib ravioli - Pretty good. Nothing stellar. Weirdly enough, i liked the veggies in this dish better than the ravioli
-Tuna tartar- Winner! I love tuna tartar and this one was super tasty. A bit spicy but the chips cut that spice some. 
-Asian steak - Good flavor in the steak. The best part of this dish was the puree under the steak! Amazing flavors
-Shrimp and grits - This was pretty good. I liked that their was also sausage in it. Grits were very creamy

While we had some decent food, here are some areas that changed this review from a 4\/5 star to a 3:
-Service- Basically non-existent. I am not a needy customer. However, our waiter forgot to put in our first two items. Thus, we waited about 45 minutes from when we got wine to when we got food. Normally, that would have been ok, but this girl was hangry major and it was just a dip we ordered! He thought we were perusing the menu and we thought he was just waiting for our food. Didn't really apologize for forgetting to put the food in. Once the food started coming out, it was steady and as expected for a tapas place. It was fairly bare minimum service. 
-Noise level- I recognize they are trying to go for a hip restaurant vibe but it was so freaking loud in there that I couldn't hear across the table, much less beside me. Between the loud music and all the people, it was just insane. I'm totally great with that loud atmosphere vibe but this felt above and beyond the normal loudness. I know this sounds whiny to complain about but if I can't even hear you from right across from me, that's a problem.
-Price to Value- Been to many tapas restaurants in this city and I thought that everything was priced a bit higher than others. I am totally great with paying higher prices, if I think it is worth the value. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the value matches the price. 

Maybe my expectations were a bit higher. Regardless, I think this is a place in Uptown that everyone should check out cause I feel that, once some kinks are worked out, this place will shine.",Restaurant
rK0mpVEpA40CY77T6jXSQg,AugVfQPFLA4-J-qqI0VD9A,YE-LFtEuvVW3YWDj-ZrHOw,2014-07-12,"Let me write some praise first: the sales department is fantastic.  We bought a bike for my wife and were pretty pleased with how things went.  The salesperson who assisted us recognized us each time we returned to the store, and inquired as to our ongoing satisfaction with the bike.  It made the store feel like a friendly environment, one in which we were valued.  They have a nice selection of bicycles from good brands, too.  I would not hesitate to buy another bicycle from them in the future.  4-5 stars for the sales department, and the only reason why this review isn't a single star.

The mechanical repairs department, on the other hand, has completely lost my trust.

I brought my own bicycle in for their tune-up service.  They ask if there were any problem areas to focus on, and I noted some minor shifting issues and a tear in my front tire; I wanted their opinion on if it was still safe to use.  The tune-up would be $70, but any other repairs that I wanted would be extra.  The wait time would be two weeks.  It's summer - probably their busiest season.

One week and six days later, I received a call that my bike was ready.  I went to pick it up and was shocked when I was told that I owed a little over $210.  They had gone and changed a number of shifting-related components, and they had replaced my front tire with something of their own choosing (which was also the highest-priced item on the receipt, tuneup excluded, and which cost close to double that of the original tire).  I never received a call to ask about tire preference, nor to receive a go-ahead on making the repairs.  If I had known the cost up-front, I would have sold the bike and bought a new one.  Adding insult to injury, they had evidently tossed the NEW inner tube in the front tire, and charged me for another.  I inwardly grumbled and considered making a fuss, but ultimately paid and took my bike home.  I wanted to ride, and I trusted that the mechanics had chosen what they did for good reason.

Within the first 20 miles of receiving the bicycle after the repairs, I discovered that my front tire had a flat.  I was riding along paved paths and crushed gravel; the usual Pittsburgh bicycle paths that had never given me problems before.  I changed the tube and discovered that they had installed a tube meant for tires of 20-25mm width, whereas mine are 32mm.  Such a mistake meant that tube was destined to have a very, very short life.  This was listed on the receipt, but it was such a sloppy error that I was certain that the cashier had simply rung it up incorrectly.  I changed the tube and grumbled to myself, and then noted that my shifting issues still existed - only now at a different set of gears.

Looking at these issues and expenses, what did I get by bringing my bicycle to the shop?  They tossed my inner tube and charged me for the luxury of buying and changing yet another inner tube due to their carelessness, putting a major damper on a weekend ride with my wife, and they charged me around $100 to simply modify the shifting problems that I was having.

After verifying with cycling friends that this was truly a sub-par experience, I went ahead and contacted the shop to express my grievances.  The manager on duty, Dennis, stated that the shop is supposed to call the customer before performing the repairs, and offered that I could come by at any time and he would adjust my bike for me on the spot in order to resolve the shifting problem once and for all.  He would also do something to rectify the inner tube situation, stating that he wanted me to be ""100% happy"" and ""it isn't really an excuse for what had happened, but we're incredibly busy.""

I returned to the shop the day after speaking to Dennis.  He didn't seem to remember our full conversation when I met him, but he did adjust the bike while I wandered around the store.  ""The problem is that the mechanic who installed everything didn't test-ride it after making the adjustments,"" Dennis told me, before assuring me that everything should be fine after this.  I was somewhat shocked by this bit of news.  I take the bike to the shop because I don't know how to make those adjustments.  If the mechanic isn't even going to ensure that everything is tuned properly, what's the point?  I might as well save myself the time of driving back and forth between my home and the shop and save a lot of money by fumbling through it myself.  With regard to the inner tube issue, Dennis gave me two new, packaged inner tubes with a higher sale price than what I had been sold (not that the performance should be any different, but I appreciated the gesture).  No effort was made to rectify the fact that repairs and changes had been made without my consent, other than the statement the day before that the mechanics would be spoken to.

Will go elsewhere or attempt repairs myself before bringing my bike in for service here again.",Shopping
Xp1ZHunL7VYG8dTsqSxy7g,G8gaMCgNIZjXeAQSii1QPA,54mFqsRyxH-ud7dX1zwejg,2012-01-10,"Their customer service or interest in retaining a client base is an absolute joke.

When I was living in Pittsburgh for a few months, I was excited to find an Aveda salon, as I trusted an Aveda salon when I got my hair cut in Atlanta. Needless to say, I felt comfortable with booking an appointment with them.

Chelsea is very talented and was very helpful while I was in the chair. She was pleasant and helped guide me through my process. In fact, everyone was nice and welcoming. I had several people introduce themselves to me, and I appreciated the way the employees actually got to know new clients. Very impressive. Van Salon is certainly a place I felt like I could revisit at the time.

However, I have to complain for a few reasons. Though the overall experience was very pleasurable, it is how they handled (or didn't handle) my dissatisfaction with my experience that has me smearing negativties at this joint whenever possible. 

I hate to do it, since I am not quick to complain or gripe. 

I booked my appointment with the intention of simply touching up a previous color job from another salon and trimming my bangs. I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a full cut or full color, so I wanted to make my visit to Van an ""in between visit."" 

While I was booking this appointment, I emphasized that with the gentleman at the front desk. I also was getting my hair cut over my lunch break. I was only allotted an hour, so I made sure to mention this to the gentleman. With that, he said that I could just go in and out without a blow dry or style, as this was an added service as well. That seemed perfectly fine. A quick spot of color, a snip of the bangs, in-out, boom--no problem and I'd be back to work on time. 

I don't know if there was a miscommunication, but for that type of service, I would've expected it to be reasonably priced. I saw in their service menu that the prices of color started at $45 and a cut was around the same. Since my requests were incredibly low maintenance, I was expecting the total bill to be around that general price--$75 at the absolute highest. Imagine my shock when the total was over $100. I was sickened that Chelsea literally put color only on the top of my head, made a few snips, and I swiped my credit card for a service that was, quite frankly, one of the easiest services I've ever asked for. There were no foils involved, there were not outlandish requests. I fail to see how charging a new client over $100 for a simple service of root-touch up and a bang trim while also requesting to not have a blow dry\/style as to get back to work on time is hardly justifiable. 

There is something about getting your hair cut at a salon like Van. You want to feel refreshed and proud of your new style. Getting my hair done is something I am only able treat myself to every few weeks. I did not have that feeling when I walked out of the salon, over $100 poorer.

I understand that Sewickly has an expensive cost of living. I do. But the Aveda salon I went to in Atlanta was a place I had been frequenting for over 12 years. Their services were also in an affluent area, but a service full color and full cut would only pull $85 from my pockets. I was always happy to pay that because I knew I got a full service and they always did a fantastic job.

 It troubles me that the service menu says the prices ""start at $45"" and when I had something incredibly simple done to my hair, I was charged beyond the ""starts at"" price. What service it is then, exactly, that is $45? I would not have opted to make an appointment if I knew I would be unfairly charged for my requested services.

But, that's just half of it. I contacted Van after this incident to make them aware of my disappointment, and to perhaps explain the breakdown of why I paid too much money for the simple service. I sent them an email AND a follow up when I hadn't heard from them 10 months ago and am thinking that I won't ever be hearing from them.

f7VmscYCEVd1DzFT0s-rfQ,g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,2012-11-25,"Location: Meh. Nice looking place, Boca Park, but I can't stand the uppitiness of the majority of patrons here.

Ambiance: Cute, but way wannabe-fancy-er than authentic-feeling. That probably comes with the Boca Park territory, though.

Drinks\/Food: Excellent! Both my coffee drink (an iced cappuccino -- or iced latte (we'll discuss in the next section)) was super tasty, with just the right amount of smoky, roasted flavor, and the quiche Lorraine was delicious!).

Sustainability: I likes that they use actual cups\/glasses\/silverware if you're staying there to consume your tasty loot, and I loved that their to-go containers\/bags (which I *eventually* got... read below story) were recyclable\/biodegradable.

Service: Not awesome, but not the worst either. The big, bearded dude making drinks was awesomely friendly and non-hipster-douchey (refreshing in these sorts of places). However, the girl who took my order had no listening skills whatsoever. She also wasn't very friendly. It wasn't that she was UN-friendly, per se; it was more like she was on narcotics. Blank stare, no emotion. Eh, whatever -- I digress.

While in line, I had looked at the board behind the counter and picked out an iced cappuccino, which was said to come in either 12 or 16 oz, and a quiche Lorraine (they had a few different yummy-sounding quiches, soups, salads, and maybe also sandwiches. For once, I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich). I asked for the 12 oz iced cappuccino and a quiche Lorraine, and I specified that my order was to-go. The big, bearded dude leaned over a bit and gently corrected me, ""We do have an iced cappuccino here, but we just call it a latte. Also, it only comes in 6 oz."" I stared confusedly back at the board, then back at him. ""Ok, that's fine. I was just looking at the board, I've never been here before."" He said something else in reply that I couldn't hear, but it had a kind feel to it. I didn't feel like arguing over what their own menu said, so just I made sure to reiterate that I'd like it iced and to-go. The girl rang up only the coffee and asked if I wanted anything else. I again ordered the quiche Lorraine and again reminded her I wanted them both to-go. She took my payment and thanked me. I went to go wait.

My iced cappuccino\/latte came out first in a normal glass; a different girl brought it out, so I'm sure the order-taker did not actually mark my order to-go. I asked the drink-bringer if I could get it in a cup to-go. She looked at me like I should've said that when ordering, but changed it out without a word. The order-taker comes out from behind the counter around 10 mins later with my quiche on a regular plate with silverware and walks right past me to where the tables are, saying ""Veronica?"" I called over ""Um, I'm right here."" She handed out the plate to me. I try a different tactic. ""Could I please have you put this in something for me so I can take it with me?"" She looks at me blankly with the same you-should-have-specified-that-before face the other girl had and said, ""You mean to-go?"" I'm quiet for a good three seconds. ""Yes,"" I reply with my best equally blank face. She disappears for a while and then reemerges with my quiche, nicely packaged in a to-go container and bag. I smile at her and thank her. She appears about the same as usual.

Summing it up: A tasty, though frustrating experience. You come to a local coffee shop to relax & get good service. Sambalatte failed me there, but I'm definitely willing to give them another shot. (Woah, there was no pun intended there, but now that I see that it could totally be an espresso pub, I'm still leaving it there.)

UPDATE: I received a Yelp message from the business apologizing for my experience, which I appreciate. He also gave this comment and asked that I correct my language, if possible: ""I believe the languague narcotics it is strong and offensive for a drug free work place. As well, we check background of our Team Members."" I would like to clarify that I did not intend to accuse the cashier that day of actually being on drugs; the language used was simply meant to be analogically descriptive. I will leave the original review as-is to preserve artistic integrity, but I did feel it was important to make that clarification, as politely requested.",Restaurant

First off I love the atmosphere and decor of the place. Upscale bayou? can that exist? seems like they were able to do it. Plus its nice and dark and comfortable.

One thing I recall is how great the service is EVERY TIME i go. Three different visits.. three different servers.. top notch each time.

Food!

Appetizers

Wings:
Delicious! These are smoked, fried, and then sauced. I hate(strong word on purpose) baked wings. I thought I was going to hate these but the combo of the smoked then fried works amazingly. It allows them to only flash fry for crisp. This keeps the wings juicy and plump but with the fried crispy skin that wings should have.

Brisket Fire-Pie:
Don't bother :\/ I knew this was risky but I had a pizza craving. Normally BBQ pizzas have way to much BBQ sauce. This was the opposite it had very little sauce.. so little that it had no flavor impact leaving you wondering what that funky after taste is.

Cornbread:
Strong corn flavor.. not overly sweet. Could feel the grease\/butter levels killing me not so slowly. But was good to the taste buds.
-----------------
BBQ

Pulled Pork:
Nice smoke flavor and good moisture content without being overly fatty. Not the best I've had but no complaints.

Brisket:
Same feelings as the pork. It was good and executed properly but certainly not the best I've ever had. None of the BBQ was overly salty but some of it was to far on the other end of the scope and could have used some more salt. There was no real bark on the brisket which was a little disappointing.

Smoke Links:
I didn't care for these at all. They were to fatty for my taste and needed more... something in your face. I think everyone agreed these were the our least favorite items.

Baby Back Ribs:
Very tasty ribs but surprisingly not my favorite out of the three offered. These are usually the safe best for best ribs at whatever place your at. There was something out of whack with the meat itself. It failed to really pick up the smoke flavor maybe? They were moist and tender and fall off the bone. But fall off the bone on the side of smoked to long.

Beef Ribs:
Surprisingly lean for beef ribs. Since they were so lean these could have used a little more time in the smoke unlike the baby backs. Beef ribs take a much longer time to break down to perfection.

St Louis Style Ribs:
YUM! Best ribs on the menu. Next time this is all I will order in the rib category. Flavor was great., meat was great., still a little over done but it took nothing away from them. I would come back for this alone.
-------------------

Sides

Mac & Cheese:
Delicious but they went the fake cheese route. It is hard to make good mac and cheese the old fashion way. Its hard in small quantity let alone restaurant quantity. I would rather have them understand this and serve it with primarily fake cheese and be tasty then try and do from scratch and serve me curdled cheese fail.

Pecan Cole Slaw:
Also sexy! Crisp, cold, refreshing, and not soggy. The nuts were a nice addition but if they could have somehow brought it out more in the dish it would have been ever better.

Potato Salad:
Mmmmmm. This was great and a tie for best side dish with the mac and cheese. Be warned.. This is HEAVY. Its probably 90% mayo but its potato salad.. its not healthy don't try and make it healthy. They did it right. It took a year off my life and I loved every bite of it. Its the bad years anyway! Creamy, perfect amount of mustard, great seasoning, lots of fresh dill.

Beans:
Interesting.. Sweet but not grossly sweet like some. Smokey but almost to a crazy level. When I tasted this I honestly felt like I was eating something with a liquid tobacco smoke flavor. It also had a lot of what was probably the BBQ beef in it. Not sure what I thought about this.

Planned Return Order:
Wings
St Louis Ribs
Mac & Cheese
Potato Salad
Pecan Coleslaw

Get these if nothing else and I would be shocked if you didn't leave grinning ear to ear.

Cons:
Awkward Location
Awkward Parking
Pricey

For those still stumped by the ""how can fall off the bone be bad"" the best test for ribs done correctly would be ribs tender enough to pull apart with your teeth but ones you can pick up and hold by a bone and not have fall apart. If you pick up ribs by the bone and the meat stays on the plate and the bone comes up clean its been neglected. I know this sounds crazy to most but when you have enough ribs done properly you will taste and appreciate a rib that was on as long as it was supposed to be and no longer.",Restaurant
v_iFnKOf0qimzzB5eKkZPA,-ARdx8hOcEWlMDjzwLYZ_g,BlvO20Oag6FZfq9zLk9LMg,2012-05-10,"Fifteen months ago I had great cause to write an old-fashioned complaint letter, but I didn't.  I am hoping to remedy that lapse in judgement right now by sharing this review and writing directly to the offending party as well, first thing tomorrow.

My fear of guns has been a lifelong fear.  There is a personal reason why this fear is stronger now, but I worry that that story might sully the facts of this situation, so I'll just stick to the facts for now. When two friends asked me to join them for a gun class at Anthony's Arms in March of last year I reluctantly agreed, feeling that I might conquer my fear and ""arm"" myself for the future, should I end up in a comprising situation with an armed individual.  From the moment I set foot in Anthony's Arms I was resolved to treat the class fairly; leaving my preconceived notions of ""gun people"" at the door.  I patiently listened to the politically-charged introduction about how ""lucky"" we are to live in a country that recognizes an individual's right to gun ownership.  I didn't even smirk when the instructor swore that guns were not ""weapons"" at all - instead insisting that PEOPLE are the weapons. I was determined to learn how to use a gun properly...and promptly write to my congressperson about the necessity for stricter gun control immediately after the class.  

All 10+ members of the class were seated at a series of 8 ft. tables lined end to end, all facing the instructor and the cinder blocked walls of what could best be described as a long, enclosed hallway.  I was not asked for identification and after  the introduction was promptly issued a gun.  At one point my attention turned to a woman seated nearby.  Whereas I had difficulty picking up the gun, she was all too happy to play with it and spent much of the first part of the class twirling the gun around and pulling the trigger (we'd been assured the guns were not loaded).  When our instruction officially began I gave it my full attention and tried to keep my mind off of the ""Wild Card"" seated near me.  We reviewed the parts of the gun and started by removing the ""magazine"" - to those of you like me, who think ""Newsweek"" when you think ""magazine,"" this is otherwise known as the ""clip.""  Anyway you put it, it's where the bullets go.  I took the magazine out, I put the magazine in...I took the magazine out - you get it...it was a hokey-pokey with guns.  

At one point I paused, holding the magazine in my left hand and the gun in my right.  With my right elbow propped up on the table I started to push the magazine back in with my left hand, but the Wild Card caught my eye again. She just wouldn't stop pulling the trigger and I thought, ""How can she be so comfortable doing that?""  I pulled the magazine out again to make sure I was doing it right and something small and metal fell out.  It didn't fall out of the magazine.  It fell out of the gun; specifically, the chamber (that place from where the bullet fires).  A small, metal thing lay before me on the table.  I didn't know what it was, I just stared at it.  The man seated to my left looked at me, then at the metal thing, then back at me and said ""That's pretty bad.""  I stared some more and asked him, ""What is that?""  ""A shell,"" he said.  I wondered, ""Is a shell the outside of a bullet?  That little metal thing can't be a REAL bullet, can it?""  It was.  For the past several minutes I'd been working intimately with a loaded gun, getting ready to pull the trigger.  Seated to my right were two of my closest friends - to my left, a seasoned gun owner who seemed equally as scared as I felt at this very moment.  At some point the instructor came over and I calmly explained to him what had just happened. He grabbed the gun and quietly conferred with his colleague; all the while looking at me, gauging my reaction, I'm assuming.  I just stared.  What if I had pulled the trigger?  Would the bullet have ricocheted back at me or worse, at one of my friends?  How did it get there?  Why was the gun not checked by the instructor? What if the Wild Card had been given this gun instead?  

These questions plagued me long after I left Anthony's Arms.  In fact, they plague me still.  I left that day in shock, but arrived home in a fury.  I planned to write to anyone who would listen: Congress, Anthony's Arms, the NRA, the President, etc.  I stopped myself a few times, wondering if I was overreacting and found myself at odds with my own feelings. I was so upset but at the same time, didn't want to think about it...at all...ever.again.  So, I tried to forget about it.  Over a year later I haven't forgotten about it and I don't think I was overreacting.  An unidentified individual (me) drove to Anthony' s Arms and paid $75 to take a class, during which I was given the opportunity to fire a loaded gun in a room full of strangers.  Yes, it was an accident, but those are the facts. Shame on them for letting it happen and shame on me for keeping quiet for so long.",Shopping
UKhXz3ediGdhVa5J67H1RQ,5SestduEtjxmUMPeQmgNmA,v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,2014-01-10,"SUMMARY:  biggest problem at this hotel is no thermostats in the room.  Read on...

First, this historic hotel has 3 different Yelp listings, all with their own set of reviews.  Not sure why that is, but make sure you read all of them.  Yelp really should consolidate them, but for now, make sure you go to the other Arizona Biltmore listings on Yelp and check out the reviews there too....

I've spent many Christmas Eve's on the Biltmore's patio because I have family that lives just a mile away and we love the atmo.  This year I decided to splurge and rent a room at Christmas.  Everything you read about the ""fallen on hard times"" aspect of the guest rooms is true.  It's obvious that Hilton (aka Waldorf Astoria) has decided to not sink any more money into this property for upkeep and they're relying on the majesty of the architecture and main lobby etc. to pull them through.  The result is generally disappointing but then they're offering pretty good deals for rooms (and you can understand why since the guest rooms are somewhat run down or falling apart).

The reason we loved our stay: the pet policy.  You can bring Fido and Fifi with you on your vacation.  That was the big upside.

The downside:

1)  NO THERMOSTATS IN THE FREAKING ROOM!  Ok, Waldorf Astoria WTF?  It's cold in Arizona in the winter.  We needed to use the heater.  Guess what?  It doesn't turn off on its own once it reaches a certain\/any temperature.  It just keeps on blowing.  So you have to get out of bed multiple times during the night to continuously turn on\/off the mother-bleeping heater.  After it gets too hot, jump out of bed to turn it off, then an hour later, it's cold again and you have to jump out of bed again to turn it back on.  NO - it wasn't broken.  We had engineering to our room twice.  Each time the guys just shrugged and explained that there was no thermostat.  Considering that thermostats cost all of $30, it's a travesty that GM of this hotel hasn't ordered thermostats for the guest rooms.

2)  Clueless, absolutely clueless front desk personnel.  The front desk personnel are mostly under 30 and maybe even under 25.   Let's just say that you get what you pay for.  They don't know about their own property, give out lots of wrong information and don't know themselves that there are NO THERMOSTATS IN THE GUEST ROOMS!  If they knew, they wouldn't have to send engineering over to tell us.  Our final bill was wrong and I had to explain to the person that checked us out how the debit\/credit columns worked on the receipt I was given, explaining that we weren't credited for something we'd already paid for.  They also didn't know how the bike rentals worked.

3)  Severely understaffed.  We had to call the front desk (or ""0"") many times during our stay and there were times when the phone rang over 5 minutes before ANYONE picked up, even the operator.

4)  Noisy spa.  Forget about that ""renewal"" and ""rejuvenation"" that the pretty brochure promises.  I went to the spa 3 times and each time there were annoying chattering women dittering away about nonsense, their voices echoing against the tile, each freaking time.  Some of those times it was spa personnel speaking in their loud ""stage"" voice.  Unbelievable.  Imagine trying to relax when that dittering female chatter is in Hebrew (probably the ugliest language on the planet next to German) and understand that it is no place to go if you want some peace and quiet -- no one enforces the ""quiet"" zones and there are no signs or verbal prompts to please keep quiet from staff.

5)  Dirty premises.  We saw a room service tray lying on the ground for two whole days outside the door of the room next to us and no one came to pick it up.  We walked by it each time we went in\/out of our room.  Another time we waited all day for our room to be serviced and no one came, even 4 hours after we put in a request for it.

Our stay wasn't a total disaster, but want to realistically explain to wide-eyed potential guests that, as romantic as the premises are, the hotel is not being well managed and it is sorely in need of some repair and upgrades, and possibly a whole lot of re-training of personnel too.

We'll still probably come back, but only if they get some freaking $30 thermostats installed into the guest rooms.  3 Stars are for Frank Lloyd Wright's vision and subtract two stars for some shoddy management.",Beauty

Some of the casino employees didn't even know what we were talking about. You have to go up the escalators to the 2nd floor of the Aria and head in the direction of the buffet. The restaurant is before the buffet on the right, next to Jean Georges Steakhouse. They have a few tables outside of the restaurant but since it's inside the Aria, that's the closest to outdoor seating that you're going to get. The dress is business casual. Love the liquor rack over the bar. Simply gorgeous! BTW, HH is daily from 5-7PM in the bar area only. Spacious with very simple but classic decor and very dim lighting. The fancy bathrooms are in the back corner, close to the kitchen on the side of the entrance. 

BF was very skeptical about coming here because he is not a Michael Mina fan (he's been to a few of his other restaurants and wasn't impressed). One of my foodie besties went for Valentine's Day and loved it so I was able to convince him to go here with the group. Initially I had wanted to just come here for HH but we all had evening shows to attend so we had a late dinner reservation.

Full Menu: https:\/\/butterfly1465.wordpress.com\/2015\/03\/15\/bardot-brasserie\/

For appetizers I had the Foie Gras Parfait. While it was good, I would've liked more of the Gelee to go with it to balance it out more. There wasn't enough bread to eat with the foie gras so I used the complimentary bread which was fine. We ordered an order of the Duck a l'orange for the table that everyone devoured because they all really enjoyed it. Our friends who ordered the Onion Soup thought that it was amazing (it looked and smelled really good too!).

I had the Sauteed Skate which I would say it was more fried. I had wanted something fairly light since I had all the foie gras earlier in the meal and was a bit disappointed in the skate. It still tasted pretty good (just a bit on the dry side). Loved the pureed cauliflower. Tried some of the BFs Filet Mignon w\/ Foie Gras Butter. He wasn't going to have any sauce but I wanted to try the butter so he asked for it on the side. It was ok but the filet mignon tasted better on its own (which is how it should be). Tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi and thought it was very tender and pretty good. Not the best I've had like in an authentic Italian restaurant though.

Absolutely amazing service! Even though we had a late dinner reservation that was close to their closing time, we never once felt rushed. Our chairs were pulled out for us and when someone left the table, our napkins were still folded when we came back. Plates and drinks constantly refilled. The wine list is long so the waiter had the sommelier come by to assist in picking a bottle. The sommelier tried to sell the table a $2k bottle, even though we wanted a mid-range bottle so that wasn't to helpful initially. Ended up with a really good bottle though (I'm not a wine drinker and thought it was easy to drink).

Apparently this dinner (and one later in the weekend) got me nominated in picking all the Vegas meals in the future. Would definitely come back. Hopefully for HH next time. Want to try the marrow & escargot!",Restaurant
TIsW7Cy7VceQYAgtUOH3WA,sZxXpvmBUN2fSCtK_BZFoQ,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,2009-08-18,"This place needs to be imploded.  And if it weren't directly connected to the convention center, I'm certain it would have been imploded (or sold and renamed some third rate dump casino).

While walking in, the bellhop didn't even attempt to greet or otherwise assist with baggage.  Upon check-in, you're given the choice to upgrade to a ""renovated"" room for $20.  Problem #1.  So right away, they're taking away from your experience by saying ""well, if you're not going to spend more money, you're getting a less than stellar room"" ... Gold\/diamond level members get the renovated room.  They didn't have a single bed, and the staff was unwilling to offer us a nicer room to get the room we had booked. Staff was lacking in general, I think they know they're working for a dump and hear it all day long.

After examining our first room, we found it to be pretty dirty.  I wouldn't have wanted to walk barefoot in that room.  Outside of the 1982 pink Formica tile in the bathroom, there was a stash of pubic hair on the floor.  A carpeted bath mat (gross).  The lamp shade was ripped in half.  Everything about the place felt like a low grade motel.  After finding the pubic hair, we called at 4am to complain and the next day we got upgraded to a renovated room in the East tower (2575).  It was nicer, but still below any other modern hotel's quality in Las Vegas.  I would call it ""partially renovated.""  DNA on the desk chair.  Also, the tub leaked so there was a stream of water across the floor all day, every day (a real waste in the middle of a desert!).  The place smelled strongly like sewer gas every time we entered the room.

The buffet is DISGUSTING.  And for $18 for brunch, not worth it.  Actually, if it were $8 I probably wouldn't go back.   Most disgusting, low grade food you've ever seen.  Everything is cooked to a shrivel and sits out.  Eggs benedict were inedible.  Super low quality everything.  Patrons that aren't smart enough to not leave the tongs sitting on the food (gross).  The only redeeming thing were the crab legs (snow crab though, not king).  But really, how many of those can one eat before you feel sick?   Only fake HFCS iced tea.  They have no club, so gold\/diamond members get the buffet for free in the morning.  I felt so dirty just sitting there eating the food.  I'd classify the buffet quality to be on the level of Old Country Buffet, at best.

The casino is so-so, mayyybe on par with other dive casinos.  It's smokier than just about any dive casino I went to.   There's not enough of a border between the hotel and casino; the second you set foot in the hotel door you're encased in a stench that you won't not smell until you leave the premises. If you're staying there for a convention and not to gamble, this is probably annoying.  The crowd in general is older on average, nobody young purposely goes here.  The only time we spent gambling there, the power went out for a brief second and the slots rebooted mid-play.  The nearby Riviera (the closest casino to the Hilton--a 10 minute walk or so)--is just as old but smelled 100 times better and was a much younger crowd.  The sports book room is pretty nice--it's huge with projection TV's (though it needs an HD update).  Still a fine place to bet on some horses while getting free drinks.  Their roulette minimums were $10, when other comparable casinos would be at $5 or less minimums.  No rapid roulette.  Pretty sad that the minimums here were the same as the minimums at Wynn.

The Wynn\/Encore are probably a 15-20 minute walk, and since you'll be looking for excuses to escape, probably a walk you'll do several times.

What's sad for the Hilton is their food pricing is about the same as Encore\/Wynn's, yet anyone who has been to Wynn\/Encore knows everything about those two places STOMPS the Hilton.  Hilton actually had the balls to have a page of appetizers on their room service menu where everything was $21-29 for a quantity of 6.  6 jalapeno poppers for $25.  6 chicken wings. etc etc.  Are they insane?

They nickel and dime you to death, more than just about any other hotel chain is doing right now.  $14 Internet.  No free water.  No free ""if you forgot"" toiletries.  No free business center.  They even charge $5-10 to accept a Fedex package for you, that's just insane. They charge a room service fee $2.50 *per person* 

There's no reason in the world to stay here, unless forced to because of a convention where employers require it.  Still though, there's a newish Renaissance on the opposite end of the Convention Center if you're needing to be close to the convention center.  Outside of that, there are much nicer hotels with much cheaper rates (i.e., MGM).

They're promoting that the building is 40 years old with posters and free T-shirts.. Guess what guys, AGE is not something you should be bragging about.

Amidst all the upscale dining options on the Strip, lies First Food & Bar @ Palazzo, where the food and service are non-pretentious, but the ambiance is not sacrificed. Who wouldn't  enjoy a meal overlooking the Strip?

My friend and I were fortunate enough to stumble across FF&B through our Foursquare App while checking into Zine Dim Sum downstairs. One of the tips was to try the 21oz ""Big Dobranski Burger"" - 1ft diameter, 6 cheese pieces, 6 bacon slices...sounded like from an episode of Man vs. Food, so we were game. 

We came here on Saturday, 7.31.10 at 5:45 PM and were promptly seated.

DRINKS\/FOOD:
As an FYI, FF&B doesn't have the Big Dobranski Burger anymore (BOO!) b\/c their menu changes seasonally.

*Cotton Candy Kiss ($14): More for ""show"" than anything. The martini was beautifully presented; as you pour the cocktail into the martini glass, you watch the fluffy cotton candy quickly dissipate. The cocktail itself tasted like a jolly rancher, so if you're into sweets, you will like it.

*Philly Cheese Steak Dumplings ($15.55): OMFG--A MUST ORDER! The PCSD were pan-fried to a golden crisp and was filled w\/ tender seasoned slices of beef and savory gooey cheddar cheese. The sirachi added the perfect kick to the dumplings. 

*Buffalo Wing Lollipops ($16): YUM! The meaty wings were crisp, tender, moist, spicy, and had the right amount of tang. The blue cheese dressing was creamy, savory, and slightly pungent which helped tone down the spiciness of the wings.

*Doritos Mac 'N Cheese ($7):  OK! Mac 'N Cheese is normally a treat b\/c it's a gut buster that you can only have in small doses. So, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as rich and decadent (ooeey gooey) as I expected it to be. The elbow noodles were lightly smothered in slightly runny cheese sauce, and topped w\/ Doritos crumbs to give a light crunch. Although the noodles were perfectly al-dente, the cheese sauce was really lacking in texture and taste. 

*Dr. Pepper Ribs w\/ Cheesy Grits ($24.44): YUM! The ribs were fall-of-the-bone, tender and moist. It was well-seasoned, savory, smoky and slightly sweet from the Dr. Pepper glaze. 

Oh, the grits...I normally HATE grits, but FF&B completely made me do a 180. It was extremely creamy, yet it had a slight chunky consistency for a bite. The cheese brightened up the grits by adding a salty and savoryness. Spoon-licking GOOD!

SERVICE:
Our waitress Magan was awesome; she was upbeat, friendly, and attentive. Once our orders were promptly taken and the food started rolling in w\/ in 10 minutes. 

AMBIANCE\/DÉCOR:
Nothing like your typical dive bar\/restaurant (well it's Vegas after all); dark ceilings w\/ textured wood walls, gold embossed ceilings, and dark furnishings accented w\/ bright orange chairs and orange rose-lined booths.

There are LCDs throughout FF&B, so you can keep abreast of the latest game. 

The highlight of FF&B is the view. There's like grubbing while overlooking the Strip and getting a bird eyes view of TI. Even better is getting a front-row seat when the TI show is happening.

For a Saturday dinner time, only half the dining room was full. But then again, from my understanding this place is fairly new. It's right in the Silver Star plaza, about one or two doors away from Destiny.

The fiance and I were greeted with smiles, and quickly seated. We were then handed an iPad (always cool) to order off from. While ordering they were quick to place our lemon water down, in fancy glasses I may add. The menu is very simple and easy to navigate so I appreciate that. 

There's quite a few food options, but from what I can recall, I don't remember a side dish menu, it's really not coming to me. Because I would've honestly ordered from it. You get the choice of fried noodles or soup noodles. I thought I would change it up and get the fried noodles. I had ordered the beef fried noodles and the fiance had gotten the szechuan spicy noodles. Also with bubble tea for the both of us. Mind you, it costs an extra dollar to upsize your bubble tea size. 

The one thing I really liked about the iPad menu ordering was the customization of the food options you chose. For example the noodles, you can choose if you want it to be spicy or not. For the bubble tea, you can choose what kind of topping you want and also the sugar level etc. Kinda like Chatime!

You then look over your choices, and hit send and off your order goes into the kitchen! Very cool! It might be obvious though that I've never done iPad ordering at a restaurant before. 

While waiting for the food, I found myself admiring the beautiful decor even more. There's always something exciting in every corner. The place is impeccably clean, and I love how you can watch the chef's through a window making your meals fresh. Even down to the bubble tea corner was spruced up and modernized! 

The one thing that made me uneasy is the wait staff tend to kinda ... Stare. Not in a creepy way, but in the ""I am ready to help you"" way. I don't know if it's because iPad ordering may be new and difficult to navigate for some people or the fact the place wasn't as rammed and they were just looking for something to do. I guess great customer service, but it was a little bit irritating watching a wait staff watch you eat.

Food came out fairly quick, as I would assume with any noodle place. The flavouring of my beef fried noodle was spot on, and I would for sure order it again. I was a huge fan! I'm kinda kicking myself in the butt for forgetting to take a picture of it.The beef was tender and the noodles were fried to perfection. Super delicious! The beef to noodle ratio was good also, tons of beef for you to munch on! My only complaint about the dish is that it was literally rained on by way too much green onion, fried onion and green peppers. Those ingredients alone kinda drowned out the noodles and beef which should've been the star of the dish. But again, very tasty.

My fiance on the other hand wasn't a fan of his Szechuan chicken dish. I had tried a little, and the seasoning was delicious, but there was something about the chicken. It tasted too ... Chickeny? I don't know how to put it. It's almost as if it weren't marinated with the dish (which it shouldve been to absorb the flavours) and it was just thrown in there in the frying process. All in all, the chicken just couldn't absorb those super flavourful flavours. Which was a down vote for me. And just like my beef plate, his was drowned out also by the sheer volume of green peppers, fried onions and green onions. It's good to have in a dish, but it was a bit too much.

Another thing was how slow our bubble tea took to come out. I was already 3\/4 done when it finally came out. Which kinda sucked, because I kept looking over to the bubble tea corner and there was just a lot of standing around over there. Maybe they get the iPad orders a little slower? Or some kind of delay? I don't know.

My overall experience of the place was good, not perfect but what restaurant is right? There was this one guy that stood out to me though, telling by the way he was dressed I could only assume he was the owner of the place. He was up front and centre of the eating area with nothing but sheer professionalism on his face ready to serve. You don't get to see that a lot, and I can tell he wants nothing but this restaurant to succeed. So it was quite refreshing. I recall him going over to another table and happily helping out when they were having a bit of trouble ordering off the iPad. 

I 100% will be coming back to this place, but will be trying the soup noodles. And hopefully I will be able to find the side dishes (if there even were any). I will update my review till then. But for sure a must try!",Restaurant
FMEz5IQazQP1tqghuW4h0Q,CTdOTzDz1tZHV5pQZ1eHkg,eVUmrTEqZeTKLdCS0Xf5tQ,2013-06-20,"It was hard to give this place a review.  Here's my story: (the juicy part is half way down)
My GF wanted to buy me a road bike to get me into road biking.  I had always been into mountain biking but wanted a ""get around town"" bike too.  She ended up buying me a used ""all original"" bike from AZ Bike Exchange for 500$.  The bike looked great, except for the pink break cables, but they assured me they would change them before the Tour De Fat the following weekend.
I went to pick up the bike the day before the Tour De Fat and saw they had done no work.  No big deal, its peak season for them and Tour De Fat is a big deal for the bike community.  My bike ended up getting damaged during the Tour which was no fault of their own.  When I took the bike back to get fixed it took 1 month of hounding and several trips before the bike was finally close to being ready to be picked up.  a couple of weeks later I picked up the bike.

Here's where the fun begins!
I take the newly repaired bike out for a test ride and almost get hit by a F150 because when I go to turn left at an intersection the handlebars go left BUT THE FRONT TIRE DOES NOT.  That's right ladies and gentlemen, they didn't even bother to tighten the headset.  And that wasn't all.  They took my quick release and rear break light (I was told these didn't belong on a ""classic"" bike).  After almost dieing on the bike, I decided to give it another go.  After about 10 miles, the right pedal fell off because the threads were stripped.  Back to the shop I go... again.

At this point I have made about 10 trips to the shop and rode about 20 miles on the bike in ~2 months.  I told them about the pedal and they said no problem we will just re-thread it.  Knowing this was impossible but not interested in arguing I left.  3 weeks later I called them about the bike.  They said ""no one called you?  You need a new crank arm because we can't re-thread it""...  

At this point I was done with the bike.  Too many problems and not enough saddle time.  I said I wanted to trade in.  Here starts chapter 2...

I came in to their shop to see their trade ins.  The first thing that happens when I walk in the door is I say how much the bike I bought was.  The shop guy tells me ""well I hope you have the receipt because you say 500 maybe he (the owner) says you bought it for 400"".  WHAT?!  Shady....
The first bike I was showed was a bright purple which I was coming around to until one of the shop guys came by and laughed at me and said ""Purple huh?!""  On to the next bike...
The next bike I looked at had a cracked and repaired frame.  Not that they told me it had a repaired frame, which I have to think was intentional.  I looked at some more bikes and didn't find anything I liked so I left again.   Next time I arrived they said the would sell me a ""custom hand built frame"" (fetish cycles) and put a bike together for me.  That went nowhere.  

Oh, did I mention they made my GF cry 2 times by now because of their blatant lies (like, ""these pedals only cost us like 2 dollars"", ""woah what a deal on this bike"", ""this fetish cycle frame sells for 500$"", etc.)?  No?  Well they did...

I will spare you all more details here, but after another 3-5 trips I get a hold of the owner who is the only reason this place isn't getting a 1 star.  He told me of a nice bike I could come look at.  I came by and found the bike was exactly as described.  It was in good shape, clean, and was priced 1000$.  He took my full price for my trade and lowered the price on the bike to 750$ tax included.  I left that day and have been riding the bike ever sense without any issues.  Rob is a great person to deal with.  Do not, under any circumstance, attempt to buy a bike without dealing with him.  The people he employes are unprofessional liars.  Do not take a bike here for repairs.  Do shop here for a deal on a used bike.  Just know what you are looking for and appropriate pricing before you go.  

Summary:
Rob is a good guy to deal with.
The people in the shop are greasy car salesmen and will lie to your face.
The people who do the repairs do not check their work.
The people in the shop do not call you, you have to stay on top of them.
They have a lot of bikes to choose from so you can probably find what you are looking for.",Shopping

Okay, so, the 40 taps are awesome. I'm a beer nerd from Boston so being in a new city and a new state, I like to try as many local beers as possible. They had two local beers - Great Lakes and Fathead - as well as some other beers not distributed to Boston. Now, Boston doesn't do happy hour so when I walked in, grabbed a stool with a great view of the Bruins-Blackhawks game and they then told me from 8-9pm that all drafts were nearly $2, I nearly wept. When I walked in the bar was pretty crowded for some March Madness\/after work stress release. I could see this place being an absolute ZOO during Tribe season.

I was also pretty hungry so I grabbed their Black Swamp burger, medium rare. Told em to forget about the bun (I'm a bit health conscious\/carb avoidant...I save the carbs for the beer) and sub in sweet potato fries (for a $1). So, the burger is ridiculously delicious, perfectly cooked, totally awesome. Then we get to the sweet potato fries - now, maybe it's because I just spent 2.5 months in SC at Basic Combat Training for the US Army and I am unaccustomed to anything that remotely tastes good, but these SP fries were OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. The fries themselves were amazing, but they came with some sort of maple flavored mayo\/butter\/I don't know what concoction that made me eat said fries like I haven't eaten in three weeks. I asked for an extra container of whatever that magic elixir was and I'm not a big condiment person whatsoever. That shit was like crack.

So, when the beers aren't being $2, they're very reasonably priced - lots of options under $4. My only complaint is that you have to walk up to their (very large) tap board behind the bar to get a full sense of their taps. They do have a printed menu for about half their taps, but I like knowing where they're made, the style, the ABV, etc without having to awkwardly hover next to some people trying to get their drink on as well. That being said, I could pretty much see the whole tap board from my seat so it wasn't really that bad. 

**This is the part I most want to share with Yelp. THE STAFF. WAS. AWESOME. So attentive, so friendly, so accommodating. I have found all of Cleveland to be exceptionally nice (I'm from NJ and we are actually a very nice and friendly species; Boston is cold and rude and unforgiving sometimes so I think I'm just used to my waitstaff and bartenders being arrogant pricks) but the two servers that took care of me (and the random couple from KY that happened to sit down next to me, they were awesome too) were crazy great. Always asking me if I needed another beer or water or anything, made sure I got to watch the Bruins, and when I did order another beer it got there in about 2 minutes. Like, zero wait time. Like, City Tap, if you're reading this...give your servers a high five. Or a bonus. Everyone kicked ass. Or bring them to Boston, I will give y'all the hook up.

Upstairs area has more seating and a pool table which I did not get to partake in but I am in Cleveland through Saturday so there is still time to change that. 

Basically, this bar is 2 feet from my hotel and I could not be any more pleased about it. I will send everyone I know to this bar and when we come back, I will absolutely, I mean ABSOLUTELY be back.",Restaurant
eN1xdYnvG9D51nwTbsQWpg,HCKZEpXv8CNdYLepoSMlDQ,LHyj66waFlDcw9UToo27JQ,2016-08-24,"Let me preface this review by stating that I did NOT eat any seafood here, so my review is purely based on their BBQ.
I understand this is a popular place for seafood and my friends say it's one of the best in the valley. So I can imagine a seafood review getting at least 4 stars, if not 5.
But.... I am here to talk about the BBQ portion of their menu.... which is a 3 star experience at best.

The restaurant itself is very casual and spacious, and has a fun but not overbearing atmosphere. Great place for families and big groups as well as something more casually intimate for 2. I like that there is butcher paper instead of tablecloths... their meals are VERY messy! you also get bibs and gloves if you order the seafood.  The staff is very friendly. 

I have been here twice now, and while I can tell my fellow diners really enjoyed their plastic bags full of seafood that you eat by hand, I can't say I was very impressed with their Louisiana style BBQ. 
The beef brisket is only slightly tender, but not particularly so. Compared to Bootlegger's in Old Town Scottsdale where the brisket just melts in your mouth, this is just a hair above average. The brisket definitely had a ""smoked"" flavour, but it was not coalescing very well with any flavour from the meat - which seemed a little more dry than it should. It was a smokey flavour that leaned more towards a burnt taste, than a savory beef taste.  
There are two sauce options - one is a sugary tangy sweet bbq sauce and the other a New Orleans style mustard. Both were pretty good, though nothing sensational. 
On my first visit I got the 2 meat platter - brisket and ribs. While the brisket failed to impress me, the ribs were so forgettable that I can't really think of anything to write about them. They were just very average, not memorable at all. 
On my 2nd visit, I decided to try the brisket sandwich. an utter failure! While the meat itself was the same as the platter from my initial visit (at least they are consistent), as a sandwich it was a disaster... because of the bread. Un-toasted Texas toast... with the consistency of a wonder bread. I picked up the sandwich with both hands, and before even 1 bite, it had completely fallen apart. Honestly, I don't get how in the world they get away with calling this a sandwich -  its a nasty mess because of the utterly generic low quality bread. I had to peel off the soggy broken up bread and just ate the brisket with a fork after that. NOT worth $11. no way. 
The menu said the sandwich was topped with cole slaw. I asked the waitress to add red onion and she asked ""on the sandwich, with the cole slaw?"" ""yes!""... well they brought it out and both the slaw and the onion were on the side. So either the waitress was not listening to me, or the cook was not paying attention. Either way, that is how it was brought out to me and it was pretty annoying to have to try and assemble the sandwich myself now - made that much more difficult by the fact that assembly is impossible when you can't even pick it up without it disintegrating in your hands. I had also asked for both sauces on the side, and only 1 came. While they were very nice, the service left a little to be desired. Not to mention we had a table of multiple people and only my food came out first and everyone else sat there for 10 minutes while I awkwardly stared at my food because I didn't want to start eating before anyone was even served! That's just rude and inconsiderate.

Along with the sandwich, which I would NEVER order again, I got a side of cajun fries which were excellent, and a side of mac n cheese that came out ice cold and wasn't that good. 

If you are looking for really good BBQ in the valley, I would recommend Bootlegger's in Old Town Scottsdale, and not the Angry Crab and their Louisiana style smokehouse, which is average at best.
For seafood? This place is probably quite recommendable, but again, this review is solely to critique the 2nd half of their menu, the BBQ, a ""meh"" experience.",Restaurant
qlsZDFHnscFacCUXdwwxIg,Ha7RVM-PHlgojH3dYuaPWw,cVtpNvkn5e6DZ1HEZSSGTA,2012-09-05,"Went to Montreal on Labour Day weekend for my partner's birthday and decided on Le Bremner for the celebration dinner.  We had a fantastic time. 

Neither of us drink alcohol so I can't comment on the cocktails that others have mentioned.  We've both had iffy experiences at restaurants when the server finds out we won't be drinking but no issue here.  The waiter took the drink menu and wine glasses away with a smile and told us about the house made sodas instead. Their take on cola was fun with an aftertaste I couldn't quite identify but really enjoyed.  I think it may have been cloves but the waiter told me his lips were sealed as it's a secret recipe. They also make their own sparkling water which was fine but honestly could have used a little more ""sparkle"".  

Started with the night's amuse bouche which was tuna dipped in tempura batter and fried with a spicy sauce on the side.  The sauce had a nice little kick to it without being overpowering.  Also had some oysters while we decided on our appetizers. The oysters were good but nothing special. For our appetizers we shared the raw scallops with pear, raw salmon with avacado and beef tartare with matchstick potatoes.  All of them were incredible.  Hard to pick a winner but I voted for the beef and my partner for the salmon.  

For our mains, my partner chose the hake and clams which he raved over.  The couple of bites I had of it were pretty sensational.  I had the robella and pulled pork which the waiter described as their take on surf and turf.  It was basically a white fish with a cut of pork shoulder.  It was very good but didn't blow me away when compared with some of the other dishes we had.    

Desert time.  The waiter ran through the list which included house made doughnuts, crème brule, strawberry upside down cake and a couple of other options that escape me.  My partner went with the doughnuts and I went with the upside down cake after hearing that it was the waiter's favourite, .

The doughnuts came in three and were filled with lemon, blueberry and spicey chocolate.  The bite I had of the blueberry version was great - filling was sweet and thick without verging into ""jam"" territory and the dough was nice and light.  Apparently the spicey chocolate was the best one although I didn't get a taste (damn it!).  My upside down cake was the clear winner though.  It was definitely big enough to share but I managed to eat most of it myself with a couple of bites somewhat begrudgingly offered up to my partner.  It was the perfect mix of vanilla cake, cinnamon and strawberries with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

I read some so-so reviews of the service, but didn't get even a hint of poor or distracted service at all.  Our waiter was engaging, answered all of our questions about the menu and his recommendations were spot on.  In fact every person who came to our table was helpful, funny and chatty without being intrusive.  They really set the tone for a fun night.  

Not sure when we'll be back in Montreal, but when we are, we'll definitely be visiting Le Bremner again.",Restaurant
VghsZSQQla7ONRlURpAyXA,PcTKD5172Yer60ZBiev4rg,8qAtou9A4ksXGkjyLibWDg,2010-05-28,"Arghle.  I wanted to like d.Vino so badly, with its adorable kitschy little posters all over the Monte Carlo of a pin-up riding a Vespa on a red checked background.  I'm a total sucker for stuff like that.

A quick note: If you're the guy at the $25 blackjack table playing $50 a hand, you can go ahead and skip the rest of this review because you are for shizz not going to have the same problems at d.Vino that I had.

The night started out promisingly, with a cute little area at the front for our party of 9 to wait (and a teal Vespa on a pedestal behind the bar) , and a just-right round table where we could all see each other.  We were brought the d.Vino ""house water,"" which comes in clear wine bottles and which, at first, we were not sure was free.  Our server explained that they sterilize wine bottles to serve their triple-filtered tap water, and to their credit, it was very good water.  (Weird, I agree, but a nice touch.)

A couple of us ordered the soup del giorno, a cream of artichoke and sweet corn garnished with a quenelle of ricotta and a drizzle of olive oil, and it was incredible (although the puree was sort of an off-putting non-color).  They brought out baskets of several kinds of yummy breads with fresh pesto and little cigars of butter drizzled with something tomatoey and salty.

Things went downhill from there.  The Caesar salad is $12, and a few in our party split a couple for appetizers.  They're not for splitting.  They're salad-sized square glass plates with a couple leaves of romaine, two small sheets of parmesan, and maybe five or six croutons.  I don't care how good your salad is (and it wasn't great), $12 for the ingredients on that plate is beyond outrageous.  Worse, two in our party ordered salads plus chicken as meals, and the meal-sized salads, while $5 more, were no bigger.  Just, there was also some chicken.  WTF?  The rest of the entree portions were similarly deplorable, employing the Big Empty Plate aesthetic that I despise so, so much.  

I had the chicken parmigiana, easily the largest entree on the table, and it was average.  The breading was overly herby and quite spikey, not quite fine enough, which gave it a weird texture, and the mozzarella was giving off a ""they just opened a bag of Kraft"" vibes.  However, the sauce on the accompanying spaghetti was a light, buttery pomodoro that was the highlight of the plate.  There was just nothing about it that was worth $22.

One of us got the prix-fixe meal, which came with tirimasu that was similarly average.  It was small, mostly ladyfingers, and served with two ladyfingers as garnish.  Maybe it's me, but ladyfingers are useless cookies unless they're soaked in espresso and smothered in marscapone custard, and they were just too dry to eat.  We didn't finish the tirimasu, which would surprise you if you knew my family, and should maybe surprise you anyway since I'll remind you that there were nine of us.

Worst point of the evening was the service, which was grumpy and lacking.  They seemed understaffed, but the place was sort of empty.  When we realized that they had tacked on 20% gratuity to the bill, it became clear that our server knew she wouldn't have to work for a very decent tip (came out to be like $56, pretty nice for an hour's work) so she just didn't bother.  We were sort of disgusted by the tip issue... it's not surprising to have a tip added to a large party, but it's almost always mentioned verbally or on the menu, and it's never more than 18%.  The food wasn't worth the price, the service wasn't worth the tip.  Go to the Cafe instead.",Restaurant

The place was not too busy yet but a decent crowed had begun to make its way in by this time. We were seated upstairs where its a bit more quiet. I was not aware they had an upstairs until this visit. Our waiter was very informative and knowledgeable of the menu items and the preparation of the foods and sauces, and the way several drinks were made and how they taste. The others in my group all got either  beer or an Old Fashioned of their choosing, I passed on drinks to save room for what I had been reading reviews on over the past week. Yelp gave the menu overwhelming positive reviews across the board so I was pretty sure I was going to have an easy time finding something both filling, tasty and affordable on this visit. Lets take a quick walk through this visit so prep your senses for some teasing because that's just what your in for!

My appetizer was the soup of the day($3). I got the bowl sized serving of spicy black bean and pork with corn. This was a beef broth based soup with a slight peppery note to it. The pork was shaved and very tasty. The black beans could have been cooked a little bit softer but a great soup none the less.

My main course was the No 30. Old Fashioned House Burger. ($9.95) A 6 oz burger (ordered mine medium) with fried onions, hickory smoked bacon, aged cheddar, garlic sauce, a soft cooked egg and a buttered, toasted roll. I upgraded my side item to the very highly recommended (yelp) beer battered cheese curds ($3 extra). The burger was absolutely phenomenal! Messy but not like sloppy-joe messy, simply so much substance to the burger that it becomes hard to handle. But worth it of course! My only comment here is that my burger was cooked well done (I checked after a couple bites in) vs the medium I had asked for. Outside of that, a hit for sure! The cheese curds were so good I could feel myself becoming more and more connected with all things Wisconsin on every bite I took I swear! Like small peaces of golden softness that melted in your mouth. The nice part about them is that they use a very light and thin breading leaving mostly pure Wisconsin cheese to hit your pallet! These are a must if you have not had cheese curds before or have not had them in a long time (such as my case).

If that was not enough read on.....I did go and ask to see a dessert menu (the only one in my party with room to dare ask for more). The waiter told me that the Fruit Crisp with Vanilla Spice Ice Cream ($4.95) was currently stawberry-rhubarb. That sold me right there! The ice cream was spiced with cinnamon and was good but not amazing. I was expecting a cold ice cream topping with a warm pie underneath and perhaps a crust at the bottom. Instead the fruit portion of the pie was also cold as well. Not a bad thing just not the contrast I expected. Nor did I find the crusty top or bottom I would have liked either but still, a very sweet, fruity and satisfying end to a great meal indeed!

My bill which came to just under $24 was a fair price to pay for the portions, quality and service my group and I received on this visit. I will be looking to make a return to The Old Fashioned soon to try several of their other burger listing but also to try what looks to be (and has been reviewed as) a fantastic brunch menu which for this food blogger always gets my attention!",Restaurant

I purchased a TechTouch massage chair that sells for over $5,000 after taxes.  I paid in full... no financing or anything.

They sent two delivery men to setup and install the chair.  One of them must have been having a horrible day because he was pretty rude to me as well as his coworker.  I should mention his eyes were very bloodshot, but he did not smell like drugs or alcohol.  

They spent roughly an hour setting it up.  As soon as they left I inspected the chair and found they didn't even hook the back up correctly.  I immediately called the store and asked for them to come back and finish assembly.  The rude employee came back in and 1-2 minutes later popped it into place and left without saying a single word.  During this visit they damaged my doorway (chipped the wood and paint) because they didn't have the patience or courtesy to bring it in carefully.  Plus, my $5,000 massage chair came brand new with a long streak of paint off of my own door.  So not only did they damage my doorway, they also stained the chair.

Also worth mentioning is that the delivery men trampled an expensive Turkish rug that was several feet away from the hardwood area where they were assembling the chair.  It's almost like they wiped their shoes on it over and over because it's filthy.  I bought it 3 days before their arrival so it was brand new until they showed up.  I shampooed it for an hour and it's still stained.  Thanks, Relax the Back, for trashing my doorway, chair, and new rug.

I used the chair that night and found the shoulder pads were not functioning.  Upon further inspection there was an air hose and 2 electrical connectors dangling from the back that were not connected.  I called them again and got another bothered employee.  They insisted this was a manufacturer defect.  They repeatedly said that some hoses get kinked and that this is causing the shoulders not to work.

Funny, why WOULDN'T THEY HAVE TOLD ME THIS PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE?... they wanted your money at all costs.  After my insisting they come back out and that I see hoses and connectors dangling they finally agreed to send someone out several days later.

A salesperson came out to repair the chair.  He spent 30 minutes or so opening the chair and connecting it.  Turns out the first crew didn't connect everything, which is why the shoulder bags weren't functioning. Three days later I noticed there was an issue with the speakers and that they were not operating properly.  I again called the store.

This time I was told this would be a warranty issue (EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD THE CHAIR LESS THAN 10 DAYS) and that I would need to contact the manufacturer... again, this shows a lack of service AFTER they got my money.  Before then they were accommodating and polite.  

I contacted the manufacturer.  They sent a rep to my home to fix the speaker issue.  Upon his arrival he noticed hoses running along the side of the chair and he said that is not how the chair should be assembled.  Big surprise... Relax the Back failed me again.

He replaced the speaker section of the chair and still found the speakers not functioning properly.  He then wondered if the issue was in the assembly, which wouldn't surprise me one bit.  He had to leave and reschedule so that he could have adequate time to disassemble and reassemble the chair.

It is now January 21, only 18 days since the chair was delivered and I'm already experiencing every issue a customer can.

Spend 10 minutes online comparing prices and you'll see for yourself that they're overpriced.  I purchased a Jesper sit stand desk online for $1160 shipped and assembled... Relax the Back charged $2,300 for the very same one!

Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from this place.  It will only lead to headaches and high blood pressure.


UPDATE 1\/31\/14:  Despite his friendly response below, I want to point out that Chris knew of my situation from the start and didn't do anything to try and resolve it until 2 days ago after reading my negative Yelp review.  In fact, he knew I purchased the desk somewhere else for a cheaper price over 2 months ago... I told them right in the store, yet this is the first I'm hearing of a price match or anything of that sort.  Funny how he never addressed any of this until my review was seen.  

Also of note, he has known of the issues with the chair\/delivery\/etc., since they first occurred.  Unless of course, this happens to all of their customers and he has me confused with another customer whose new chair was setup incorrectly, doorway was damaged, and brand new $1,000 area rug was ruined.  I did speak with him this week.  They offered to reimburse me the cost of having it cleaned, although I'm skeptical.  I will update my review if that happens.",Shopping

I still really like this location, however I would suggest being choosing in who you select as your tech. the owners work is on point. Also there are two female artists that sit in the center w\/ precision work skills. All three are my favorite when it comes to creating the standard of work in which I need to keep from obsessing over length or gaps. 

Also the color changing acrylic powder is worth the splurge. I had tons of compliments on it. Very cool.

Extremely pleased with I had done as a Saturday walk in. The previous week, I had my nails done by a location that wasn't my usual. I called Seasonal Nails because two nails were broken, my paint looked streaky and uneven, and my nails were really, really long. Things were bad. UGLY BAD when I arrived. 

I was hesitant to try the location as a walk in but my nails were looking beyond rough. They were terrible. I could wait until Monday and walk around looking crazy with broken and fracked nails for the rest of the weekend. So I figured I'd give Seasonal Nails a try. 

The first thing I did was call. They said they could take me in an hour. So since I was down the street I said I'd see them then. Despite walking by, I'd never been inside. I noticed right away that the store was quite clean and when I was directed to the back to pick polish, they were organized. Very organized. The gel colors that had matching enamels were matched with them. I loved it. So if there was a color I loved - I could decide if I wanted it in gel or enamel. Or do gel on my toes and the matching color on my fingers.  Picking colors is always hard for me. Disorganized salon nail color makes it even harder. Finding a salon with highly organized polish had my inner self completely geeking out from excitement. I loved it! 

It's no secret that I treat my nails with very little love. Which is why I get them done. Without doing so they tend to look like I've been substituted my hands for a shovel while out digging trenches. 

Well Seasonal Nails fixed my horrible looking nails by cutting down all of my nails. Removing the bad paint job. Painting my nails. Fixing my two broken nails. Filing and filing my uneven nails. All in all they looked awesome when I left. The best part. The price. They were extremely reasonable considering the amount of work done. $14 total. 

I was so pleased with Seasonal Nails work & how pleasant the employees and other customers were to be around that I returned for my next appointment. I did feel guilty cheating on my regular place but their location is extremely convenient. The staff have great personalities. 

One if the things that I really like about the staff is their willingness to explain processes and services that I haven't tried. Other salons have tried to pressure me into up-charges and sales but have never really explained in depth or carefully the pros and cons. It's usually more about a sale. The staff at Seasonal Nails were extremely patient in explaining ombré pink and white gel to me and not only how to apply them but also how they are maintained and the cost benefits and cons. This isn't something other salons have been upfront with. I liked that the staff have their own nails done and use nail products themselves so they can show how various services maintain their look. 

I'm very pleased with my nails. They look fantastic. Color is fabulous. No lifting. Length is even. Meticulously shaped exactly as I asked. Clean work. My cuticles and skin weren't irritated or cut. Very professional and stress free service. Very chill, personable store.",Beauty

I decided to purchase a Groupon from this business for my fiancé and I to have a creative date. I made the mistake of purchasing the Groupon before scoping out the business or looking at the reviews. After I purchased the Groupon I decided to call the business to get more info as sometimes there is ""small print"" on Groupons. A lady answered the phone... I kindly said ""hello how are you"" she replied ""OK how can I help you?!"" she seemed to be bothered, busy or just be an old bitter lady. I asked her how the Groupon would work and she explained that I needed to make an appointment to be in one of her classes. The classes would be a group class and she said she did not have slots open for Groupons until a month out. This was disappointing but I thought ""what the heck, I already bought the thing"" so I asked her to book us. She made a very rude ""ugh"" sighing sound and asked me to hold because she was in the middle of something. Totally unprofessional! If she was in the middle of something she shouldn't have answered the phone so that she wouldn't be rude or she needs to get herself a receptionist if she can't handle answering phones!  She comes back on the phone a few minutes later, again making rude sound effects (not necessary) how is it I am helping YOU with YOUR business and you want to be rude?! Truly makes no type of sense! Anyhow she gave me a date and time. We were booked for a Saturday morning class and I hung up. At the time I did not live in Arizona and this was a long distance relationship, so I planned my trip to PHX for this weekend to enjoy this date.  A month later My finance and I were ready to go to the class I woke up excited and looking forward to having a nice, interesting and fun date. Interesting was all it was! The location was about 40 minutes away from where he lived so we left early just in case there was an inconvenience on the way. We arrived 10 minutes before our booked appointment and upon entering the business there was a class going on with about 8-10 people. We stood at the front desk for a few minutes unacknowledged. After 3 minutes of not being greeted or asked if we needed help, I decided to walk up to the class to ask for assistance\/guidance as our appointment was about to start. A lady walks up to me and says ""what can I do for you?""  Again, rude! I let her know we were there for an appointment and that we have a Groupon. She walks away and as she is walking away from me she is speaking and saying that there is no way that we have an appointment because Groupons are not booked at that time and that she has another appointment coming in at that time. She gets her calendar book out and points to the date. I see my name CLEARLY on there and pointed it out to her. She then says that is not me. I was like ""what?!, that is my name on there!"" She tells me ""It must be another person with the same name"" OK, another person with my EXACT name? What are the odds? LOL if my name was Jane Doe, I might agree with her.  I felt we were in the twilight zone. At this point I was fed up with her lies and attitude! From the moment she saw us she was nonchalant, rude and unprofessional to say the least. We felt discriminated! I advised her that we didn't even want to take her class and that we would simply like to be refunded the money. She began to talk over me and not allowing me to finish what I was saying. Mind you there is a class going on a few feet away and she seems to not even care about her attitude in front of those people.  She blatantly told me she was not giving me my money back and I could re-schedule my class. I told her ""ok, so reschedule means you acknowledge this was my appointment"" she stayed quiet as if she did not know what to say. That is when I realized this lady is not all there and she is being racist. How can you reschedule if you weren't scheduled to begin with?!  So we walked away and decided to call Groupon instead to complain and get the money back. I immediately called Groupon and made them aware of what happened and let them know how this lady was running her business and using Groupon, a reputable company. After being placed on hold for a few minutes (to investigate) the agent advised me that the lady\/business owner marked my Groupon as ""used"" that I had ""redeemed"" the Groupon. She not only is rude and a liar but now she committed FRAUD! Like really? Anyhow after more explaining, Groupon decided to refund my credit card and it was over with. I would NEVER recommend this business to ANYONE. It was the absolute worst and all I wanted was to have a fun date. Instead it was the worst and the most annoying part was that we drove all that way (40 min) for that type of treatment. Honestly I believe the lady was being racist and discriminatory towards us.

oxpSTcsUf7kqQAUlFWR1RQ,m33gSTi0Fyo3W2Qw6WVdtA,P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw,2014-07-29,"First of all, I want to start off by saying that the Cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. Everything that is the Cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. The types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- the bottom of the barrel. Don't get me wrong. The building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. LCD screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. I just can't stand how un-classically Vegas it is. They try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. The addition of Holsteins Shakes and Buns to the property is just the cherry on top. I heard ravenous reviews about Holsteins and I was excited to try this place. Things like, ""the best burgers in Vegas,"" and ""I Love Love Love Hoslteins"" were some of many glowing reviews. Here is my 2 cents.

The lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. Surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. Unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. Lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. Theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. The truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. My favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. It consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.

Upon request, which I thought was complimentary, was popcorn. Though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. I read that it was truffle popcorn. Excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. It was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. This was a weird mix and though not appetizing, I found myself reaching for the popcorn. I ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. The sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. I guess my curiosity superseded my palate.

Quite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food I am most knit picking about, the burger is a classic. From the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, the burger is a great vessel to work with. With such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.

And now, the Rising Sun burger -- It had Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Their take on a Japanese burger sounds good on paper. The fried avocado alone would make me happy. It was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. I just didn't have enough of it. That probably was the only thing good about this burger. Everything else was a mistake. First of all, what is wrong with this is the Kobe. I hate when restaurants advertise as serving Kobe when we all know most of that is just an American breed, if not, from Australia. Second of all, when you cook a ""Kobe"" beef burger, it has to be rare. Nothing else will do. What I got was all grey inside. The crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. That is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. The teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. Did I order the wrong burger? Maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.

If anything, the drunken monkey shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. It had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. The adult version has Frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from Italy. I opted out and went with just a regular. ""You are in Vegas. Live a little!"", you say? In hind sight, maybe I should have made this shake alcoholic. It would have made me feel better about the sub-par meal I just had. Still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.

Pretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. I just can't associate this restaurant with good food. The same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe Johnny Rockets, with a lower price, and I still wouldn't think twice about it. I mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. Come on! The food really needs an upgrade. How awesome would it be if finally, the Las Vegas Strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? I think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. I guess I just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. For now at the Cosmo, I guess Secret Pizza will have to do.",Restaurant
DJ_YvzTUSOPIt4TnBGSSbg,d8Nz9m-8pYosZKPjd9yNBA,8NA8aAHSgbFiLEgpAWVT1A,2017-07-12,"Really disgusted with their service. Had maybe 1 good experience ever at this location. Their employees here do not care about customer service or making your experience exceptional. Many visits I've made with my family ended up dealing with inattentive sales associates that ran off to gossip or help other people and leaving you all alone with the product. 

The sales staff isn't helpful, but very lazy when they are assigned to help you. If asked about specific information or products, they are a deer and headlights. Or like a almost dead fly buzzing around trying to figure out where to even start for the answers. 
Don't have any sense of the product knowledge or what's available. Make up excuses so that they may be lazy and not check for you if items are available elsewhere. 

Basically for a luxury retailer that sells items around 2k and up should really be going above and beyond regardless of how you dress, or how long you take to decide on a product or how many questions you have. Just to see if they know anything, ( I am an avid brand junkie who knows way too much for their own good ) I would ask specific questions myself to make sure of the answers, only to be answered with falsified information to save themselves the trouble of finding the real answer, when confronted about what I had been told or researched. 

One experience recently was when I was inside the store hoping to spend some good $$$ (3-4K or more for my anniversary present that could have been any other designer like Chanel or Hermes and I stupidly chose Louis Vuitton) the whole time whilst trying on the item another sales associate who wanted to make her sale hovered around my husband and I while we were trying the bag and looking. Our sales associate wasn't attentive to listening to what we really wanted and which products we described. She would keep showing us items that we hated and not even close to what was asked for. Obviously just to make a sale. 

Which ruined the experience of purchasing as it put pressure on us to quickly decide on the purchase or else she would take the bag away. This is terrible business practice to pressure customers while they are trying the product. This is a sure way to lose a sale for the staff. Although even after we made it very apparent we would be taking the item, the other sales staff still hovered around for 30 minutes or more standing beside me and my husband plus our sales associate while her other customers waited just to steal the bag away. 

At this point we decided that since they were negligent in helping the situation and making the experience of our purchase exceptional, we did not buy the item. We confronted the sales staff we felt uncomfortable during the shopping experience, and that she shouldn't have let her colleague do that. Her answer was "" It doesn't matter because your not buying the bag anyways. Her customers wanted to see it"" and we had told her that still it wasn't right to stand around the whole time while I was trying on the item whispering "" is she done yet"" to you while we are looking. Soon after not taking the bag our sales associate got quite hostile and began to clunk and grab everything away from us. My husband wanted to make a formal complaint, and was told "" Well since your gonna complain about me I might as well write EVERYONES name too"" ( then shoves the card in his face). Soon after speaking to another sales associate who is my personal shopper for Holts, I had been told the name for the person whom had done that or was involved was fake and she had lied to us about who she was to stay away from getting the complaint but rather gave another girls name to take her fall unknowingly. I feel bad for people who have experiences like this who are just trying to get a slice of luxury with their hard earned money. Nobody deserves to be treated like this, and discriminated against while shopping.  

If it was me running LVMH group I'd be disgusted with this brand and how they've let their staff run ramped. 

Piece of advice if you don't want to be treated like crap, stick to the originals like Bloor St. Or Holt Renfrew. They are mostly older sales associates not hooligan millennial girls who got lucky and hired cause it was cheaper. The old school sales associates will pamper you to the high heavens and actually appreciate and see the value in creating an overall fabulous luxury experience while purchasing an item!",Shopping

It's an effort for an employee to even answer a question, and when they do attempt to help, you should expect MAJOR attitude. My last visit, I feared for my safety. I came back to my office and told a colleague ""I thought I was going to get beat up."" 

I was standing in an aisle trying to find a spray that I purchased here before, and I could not find it. I kept looking, hoping to find it before having to ask someone to speak to me. No luck, so I finally ask the person at the front counter and she directs me down the aisle I was in. After finding the spray, which is in new packaging,  I turn and see some polishes in the clearance section. 

There was a bowl with a front opening, tilted on a downward angle. Something you find tootsie rolls or something in at a candy shop. You know the bowl.  Probably not the best container to jam polishes in. I take one out and the one behind it comes tumbling out and on the floor. It breaks in pieces and sparkly nail polish splatters all over my designer jeans and leather shoes. I say ""i'm sorry"" as I look towards the cashier counter. I get no response. I'm standing there a mess for a few minutes, and I finally ask ""do you have something for my shoes, can i have a paper towel?"" The same girl that attempted to help me earlier (I wouldn't call it help when it's a struggle to show me an item) got some paper towels and slowly made her way down the aisle not making any eye contact. I tell her that I simply removed one polish and show her how it was set up. She moans, asks the other girl if there's acetone (which i didn't quite understand as i just passed an aisle of acetone) and she then begrudgingly started to pick up the nail polish bottle with paper towels.

 I attempt to help with the one paper towel she gave me and then decided it wasn't worth getting myself more of a mess since she wouldn't even offer me something for my shoe, pants or even attempt to agree with me that it wasn't my fault. She mumbled a curse word under her breathe, so I made my way to the counter. I ask the other employee about a product I previously purchased at this location. In complete disbelief that I would even have the nerve to ask for more help, she asks what brand. I tell her and say it's in a black and white bottle. Her reply ""They are all black and white."" Really? We just passed brands and bottles displaying every color of the rainbow. I bring her to the brand, which clearly is the only plain black and white generic brand.  She grunts and says, ""oh, we don't carry that anymore. "" She shows me another brand and holds it out in front of my face until i take it. I look at it and hand it back. I thought she was going to growl at me. Seriously at this point, I was in fear for my safety thinking the other girl was going to attack me from behind, so I go to pay. 

I don't know what possessed me to think a return at this point was a good idea, but I tell her I have a return. Wow, first time no questions were asked. Just dirty looks and grunts. I do get my return and purchase complete and thank her. Believe me, the Jersey in me wanted so bad to say something to both of them, something to the affect of ""If you're so miserable go work somewhere else or have you heard of customer service?! Sorry you had to work today!""  But for my own safety, I hightail it out of there and decide I won't be going back to this location EVER. I'll visit the Sally in my neighborhood that actually has customer service. 

I don't expect management will be reading this or do anything about it, especially considering they are the ones that hired these miserable, unengaged employees. But, for the customers that might come across this location searching for some beauty supplies, please do yourself a huge favor and go to another! I sure hope my $7 spray was worth it.",Beauty

I am from Vegas, so like anyone else that is, or lived here long enough, you more than likely came here for a field trip with school, summer camp or simply with family and friends over the years. We are the ones who know what to expect from the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden, so the overpriced chocolates and hot chocolate don't phase us because we know better not to ""buy"" into that part of the experience. For everyone else, you will learn your lesson once and always know better from there on out, or maybe not? I personally think that locals and tourists see Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden differently and both have specific reasons for going. This is why the prices of what's for sale and size of the tour will not cause me to give a lower rating.

This isn't a place you will be spending a lot of time, so don't plan for it to be an all day event. The chocolate factory and cactus garden are self-guided tours, so absolutely go at your own pace and take in all that you can or you might blink and it will be over. When I first walked into the chocolate factory, I noticed they have a small version of M&M's World now which surprises me they took this long to put that wall of M&M's in priced at $8.99 per pound. All I can figure is people want to say they had M&M's at the actual plant in Vegas and maybe that's why they pay it. If you just ask an employee they will let you pick a color and have a sample, which is free! They are pretty good about letting you try stuff if you just ask. Then you will know if it is something you would actually buy. 

The chocolate tour isn't long. You just walk down a hallway, one side having windows so you can see the equipment and if you come during the day, when the chocolate is being made, you will see it all going down in action. You can read stuff they have posted about how they make certain chocolates and what some of the machines do. At the end of the hallway is what most us came here for. FREE CHOCOLATE! There is usually a sweet lady waiting with free chocolate, but today she was not there! Oh no! Oh well lol. After the chocolate tour, you end up in the gift shop (of course!) where you can purchase a variety of sweet goodies they have to offer which includes a sugar-free section. I always walk through the gift shop to the exit since I don't buy anything and always stop at 7-11 before coming here to get hot chocolate. The hot chocolate here cost $4.95 and is smaller sized. 

The cactus garden is beautiful all year, but when it comes to Christmas time it is simply magical! There are over 300 species of plants and most of them are covered in lights. The lights are done a little different each year because of the growth of the plants, which makes for a bit of something new and not just the same ole thing every time. So many of the plants are covered in lights that I am one of those people that wonder every year ""why didn't they fill in that spot?"". I saw an article about the guy who is in charge of the lights each year and he mentioned that they have to know their limits. Some branches might break or a cactus might fall over he mentioned if lights were put on them. Makes sense! I will not wonder anymore! If you are lucky you might catch Santa and get to take a picture with him or if he isn't, you can still sit in his chair and take a picture. If you are one of those people (like me) who spends one night during the Christmas season going on a tour of the best decorated houses in town (you can get a current list each year of neighborhoods participating from local radio, paper and news sites) then you should add Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden to your list. It is just like stopping by to see a really nicely decorated house, but it's tons of colorfully and beautifully lit plants. It's free and a fun memory for the whole family!",Shopping

My boyfriend (soon to be fiance) and I had been looking around at engagement rings for OVER an ENTIRE YEAR trying to find something that I liked enough to wear for the rest of my life. I had looked for so long at so many different styles, designs, the 4 C's, retailers, major chains, local jeweler chains and on and on and on it was turning into an engagement ring nightmare. So many overwhelming choices with a lot of retailers with low quality diamonds, and totally over priced settings. 

We stumbled upon this place totally on accident one day while we were driving around the north hills (we recently moved here and aren't too familiar with the area) and happened to find the Wexford Antique shops near route 19. 

I noticed the Diamond Design building immediately (right next to the antique shops), but never actually went into the store that day. As I continued to look at big name retail chains for rings later that week and had a HORRIBLE experience at a Kay Jewelers in Cranberry, I thought back to the Jewelry store that I had not gone into. 

I went the next day after work and am SO BEYOND glad that I did. It was literally the best decision I have ever made. Upon walking in I was greeted by the ONE and ONLY fabulous Alicia. She is the heart and soul of this business and KNOWS HER STUFF. She is highly qualified in gemology as well as diamond certifications. She could answer every question I asked her and was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about all types of stones, settings, and diamonds.  I explained my engagement ring nightmare to her and explained to her how frustrated I was and how frustrated my boyfriend was that we could not find ANYTHING that we liked. She sat down with me, was realistic with me about budget and quality, asked and listened to things I liked and wanted and also worked with me for 2 HOURS - let me try on everything and anything in the entire store, made suggestions and always kept my budget in mind. She also told me that she would NEVER EVER let me leave her store with a diamond of low quality as the major retailers do...be weary out there! She is absolutely FANTASTIC. At the end of our 2 hour consult, (which really ended up being me just hanging out and having fun with her for 2 hours with some productive conversation), I had a ring design that I LOVED as well as the diamond of my dreams, all within my budget. Before walking in there, I didn't even think that ever would have been possible for me, as I am EXTREMELY picky, particular and endlessly have champagne tastes on a beer budget. 

When we went in for our second consult, Alicia and Chuck answered all of my boyfriend's questions and eased any hesitations he had. They also told us that we would receive a discount on custom made wedding bands as we will have purchased my engagement ring there....a definite perk of doing business with them! Needless to say, we now have a jeweler we are totally loyal to and are already planning our next pieces with them. 

The most amazing thing about this place is their hand made, beyond GORGEOUS pieces. They are incredibly high quality...so much so that even holding one of their pieces in your hand you can really tell how well it is made...with a lot of care, detail and intricacy - much different from the big chain stores. Each piece is custom and designed for you specifically, or one of a kind. 

The service here is SECOND TO NONE. I felt like I was the most important person to both Alicia and Chuck  while I was there (he is the co-owner along with Alicia and also hand makes the pieces). They made me feel like I was heard, like I was ""VIP"" level important, and like my ring truly mattered to them. They were genuinely happy and excited to create my piece. I don't think you can really ask for more in your engagement ring experience as it is something SO important and meaningful! 

All of our experiences with them have been fantastic. If you happen to find yourself going through an engagement ring nightmare like I was, do yourself a favor and get to Diamond Design. They are truly the epitome of what a jeweler should be. Shop local and family owned on this one, you will NOT be disappointed!",Shopping
wekGAi_BQ4_KHPsQxjWE5Q,AyiU_jhvSYm0asLsb52rRQ,VYNriOotbFZ7Qj_6jwUB5g,2013-12-10,"After several days of business meetings in Vegas, my boss selected Sergio's as the venue for our team celebration dinner last Friday night. Our group included a total of 10 people, and although we did not make a reservation until Friday afternoon, Sergio's was very accomodating. They quickly and kindly responded to my email inquiry, confirming our reservation. Their website mentions that they provide complimentary transportation to and from the strip, so I called to make an arrangement with the driver. The gentleman who answered the call said that they typcially require 24-hours' notice for shuttle pickups, but that he would do his best to have one of the servers help us, which he did. I got a phone call about 15 minutes before our reservation from Herb, our server, saying that he would be waiting for us at our hotel valet stop. When we met him there, he was all politeness and good humor, joking with us as he helped us into the van that the restaurant uses as a shuttle. A short drive away from the strip (I think it was between 5 and 10 minutes), we arrived at Sergio's and Herb welcomed us warmly to the lovely dining room. Another gentleman (also very welcoming) ushered us to our seats at a long table that they had set perfectly and placed near the piano, at which a pianist sat and played beautifully throughout the evening. Although the place was not very crowded, it still felt cozy and intimate. It was absolutely spotless in terms of cleanliness; the decor and ambience were truly charming, with real candles lit on every table in use. The menus provided an abundance of delicious options for our meal, but Herb himself recommended a Seafood Pasta dish and the Oso Buco (which apparently they make in house over a course of 5 hours). My boss (a very well-traveled man, who has a refined palate and deep appreciation for high-quality food) ordered the Seafood Pasta and told me afterwards that it was not only the highlight among all his meals that week in Vegas, but also one of the best dishes he had ever enjoyed in his life. That compliment meant a great deal coming from him, especially after a week full of outstanding meals, in addition to bread, appetizers, and salad immediately preceeding our entrees at Sergio's. The bread disappeared very quickly, and the appetizers themselves could have been our dinner. We ordered the fried calamari (which Herb quite rightly called the best in town), the sauteed calamari (another recommendation from Herb), and the grilled vegetables platter that came with prosciutto and tomato with mozzarella. Everything was positively mouth-watering. My personal favorite was the sauteed calamari with its phenomenal sauce that was savory without being overly salty. The grilled vegetables were also perfectly done, such that the smoke and heat served to enhance all of the inherent flavors rather than overwhelm them. Everyone enjoyed each dish immensely and already began to wonder whether we would be able to finish our meals. When the house salads that came with every entree arrived, they were the ideal light and crisp interlude between the appetizers and main dishes. I would usually skip the house salad, which tends to be boring and flavorless at many restaurants, but this one was actually good enough to stand alone. I would recommend it as an entree for someone looking for a small portion \/ low-calorie option with plenty of taste to it. When the table was once again clear (which the servers did a fantastic job of throughout the evening - and our water glasses were never empty), Herb and several other servers brought out our entrees all at once (so we did not have to sit waiting for anyone while the dishes that came out first got cold). We were all thrilled with our choices. My dish, Pollo alla Marchigiana, was absolutely excellent. The chicken and eggplant were tender and juicy, and the sauce was so addictive that I ended up dipping the carrots and broccoli that came as a side on the plate into every last drop of it. The plate also came with a small piece of polenta, which I had never tried before, but was good (if not quite as amazing as the rest of the meal). Some green beans and a peeled, boiled potato remained uneaten on my plate, as I was simply too full to finish everything. After the table was clear once more (albeit littered with several to-go boxes), Herb cheerfully asked if we had saved room for dessert and showed us a tray of their dessert choices. We all deeply regretted that we had not saved room, because they all looked sinfully good. My colleagues who had ordered Herb's specialty, a Pomegranate Martini, also thought those were fantastic. While Herb drove us back to our hotel, he continued to joke with us and gave us some knowledgeable recommendations about shows to see and nightclubs to visit. The next time we make a trip to Vegas, you can be sure that we will revisit Sergio's with pleasure and ask for Herb in particular.",Restaurant

And because I ordered this, my mom went w\/the curry pork quesadilla. My dad was able to find one thing on the menu that wasn't completely gross, in his taste: the Berkshire ham sandwich.

Fifteen minutes later, the Stetson arrived. I'd heard so much about this salad and had even gone to Cowboy Ciao's website to see what all the fanfare was about. Well, as beautiful as the salad looked online, it looked even more so in person. Delivered to the table, the salad is separated in six clean sections, each vibrantly colored and chopped into teeny, tiny pieces. All the flavors are complementary to one another. Topping the salad is a light, tangy, just-acidic-enough dressing that pulls all the pieces together, resulting in a well-composed salad that works perfectly as an appetizer for two.

About 15-20 minutes later, our entrees arrived at the table. My dad's ham sandwich, topped w\/caramelized onions and bourbon mustard, and served on grilled brioche, was a tall sandwich w\/thick slices of tender ham. The meat isn't your typical Hormel variety of deli meat; it was obvious that this came from a real piece of pork, not from a vacuum-sealed pack from the grocery store. Alongside the sandwich were thick, homemade potato chips. My dad dug in immediately, enjoying the sweet onions a lot. Although this sandwich is pretty gourmet, it was simple enough to please even my father's simple palate.

The presentation of the elk tostada was beautiful. The base of the tostada was a blue corn tortilla topped w\/the white bean ""hummus"" and some melted cheddar cheese. Atop that were four or five large pieces of cornmeal-dredged elk. The consistency is similar to beef, but with a gamier taste. I would have expected it to be prepared medium-rare, but the elk seemed to be well-done, making it just a bit moister than a Phoenix summer. The creamy ""hummus"" and mild salsa helped lubricate the elk, though, so it wasn't a total bust. The entire dish could have also used some salt and pepper.

The standout meal on the table was my mom's quesadilla of the day. A large flour tortilla was stuffed w\/pulled curry pork, caramelized onions, and cheese, and was topped w\/a dollop of dollop of chipotle sour cream. The pork was tender, while the curry provided an unexpected but very welcome contrast in flavor. I'd never had pork w\/curry, but I'd certainly give it another go because of the success of this dish. The quesadilla was a tad floppy due to it not being toasted\/grilled\/broiled quite long enough. I come from a family that appreciates crispness (it's a good thing my dad likes things burned, 'cause my mom tends to burn things), so I would have preferred more color and crunch in the tortilla.

Throughout the afternoon, the service continued to be attentive and friendly. We were brought our check not too long after the table was cleared, and we slipped the gift certificate into the folder-thingy to pay for our lunch. Our waiter wasn't quite sure what to do w\/the certificate, but w\/the help of the older gentleman who greeted and seated us, there were no problems. $50 later (not including tip), my parents and I were well-fed and content w\/our lunches.

I'd like to go back to Cowboy Ciao for dinner, as my lunchtime experience there was so positive. The creative dishes on the menu make Cowboy Ciao a staple on my brother's culinary roster when he's in Phoenix, and I look forward to seeing how the restaurant's menu evolves as trends in the restaurant world change.",Restaurant
bYdhj5hbiDnNgd0Lo0uuXA,-Biq3Dt8YhkRJEO_ITrvww,jRePPkwob0NjLtSP_ZVQag,2015-08-30,"I am in shock by what has happened to me from Hawaiian Experience Spa. 

Booking with this spa is a joke. They have one esthetician who only works a couple days. I will say she is a kind and courteous esthetician, this review has nothing to do with her. With how busy they probably get one esthetician? As someone who works full time and goes to school full time it was a hassle and chore to get an appointment booked as they never had any preferable times for me. It was very inconvenient. 

About two weeks ago, I booked a Saturday appointment at 11:00. This time is again, inconvenient for me because I am up at 4:00 AM daily. I went with it though because what other choice do I have. The girl over the phone told me the time and date and I wrote it down as we spoke. I put the note on the fridge. That Saturday rolls around and I wait all morning from 4:00 to 11:00 and show up for my appointment. I walk in and they ask if I have an appointment. Yes, I do. Oh, you are next Saturday they say. Really? I say okay, I've been waiting all morning but that's fine I'll come in next Saturday. I'm irritated but don't say anything else and just leave. They do not seem to care at all, no apologies or anything. It's alright, I guess the fact that their customers have schedules and lives outside of the spa means absolutely nothing to them! 

So, now comes the straw that broke the camels back and got me to write this review. I let them know via email that I had to cancel the membership as I am moving and it would be a 20 minute drive one way. I get an email back saying there is a $200 cancellation fee per the contract. I did not sign the contract, my husband went and signed up for this place because he was wanting to be sweet and surprise me. I would never have signed the contract after reading the terms. I read the contract, yes it does state there is a cancellation fee. I emailed this Davis guy back, I believe he is the owner. I explained the situation and asked if he could make an exception as I did not even sign and I am not going to be able to get there with my schedule. I also offered to repay the free first facial that we received as a concession when we signed up. I also asked why they did not briefly go over this when my husband signed? I'm not talking reading the whole thing. I'm talking spending 1-2 minutes skimming before he signed. He knew we were moving and would not have signed had he known there was a contract break fee. We all know 90% of people do not actually read contracts before signing. I'm one of the 10% that does, but again, I was not there to sign MY agreement. Now let me clarify, I fully understand that he signed a contract and I know what a contract entails. I have been a property manager for 10 years and I can go over a 30 page rental contract in my sleep. However, one of the things I ALWAYS do to avoid situations like this is to briefly go over the lease break fee before they sign it. This way, if they need to break their contract they aren't thrown a back by the charges. They don't feel like I conned them into something. The way Hawaiian Experience went about this is just tacky and I feel like I just bought a lemon used car.  

After emailing with Davis I decided to just stick it out and pay per month and just drive 40 minutes per visit. I would rather pay and receive something than pay $200 for nothing. He mentioned that there was a $100 break fee after 6 months, I figured I'd just do that. I went in for my facial yesterday and was polite. I was not super sweet like I typically am but I was not rude either. Did my normal thing, tipped the esthetician thank you and all that fun stuff. I then get an email a couple hours later (shown in the pics) that Davis decided to cancel my membership and charge my card. After I was told of the fee, I did not say I wanted to cancel and I did not authorize to charge. One cannot just decide to charge my card as they so please. Had I initiated the cancel, yes charge the card. However, if the owner decided they want to cancel my membership at their discretion they cannot just charge as they.

I was not rude, disorderly, or threatening to Davis or any of his staff. He decided to cancel me based on the fact that I was questioning his policies and my situation. He obviously is unable to deal with upset customers. Someone like that should not be in the business of customer service. I have been dealing with irate people for some time now, and dealing with some that are going through the eviction process. I have always gone out of my way to assist and be as courteous as I can even in the worst situations. This guy just can not do it. He emailed back and forth with someone who disagreed with him and just decided to run from rather than fix the situation. He needs to gain some customer service skills and learn how to deal with people. Just because you are in the spa business does not mean all will always be sunshine and roses! Good luck! I'll be in contact with the BBB Monday.",Beauty
AZHg_vZtoI5QD641NBLkVQ,nhxgGth8pHdioirKrOvHeQ,I5QvL9LwQFuece4NXXUtSg,2013-04-08,"Update #2: I've now no longer a client. After going for a few follow-up color\/cut appointments, post our initial lightening, I've went back to my original stylist. He immediately saw the issue with my color (the ""band"" of hair color lighter than the rest) & that was fixed pretty fast. I've realized the issue at this place is completely inadequate light which made it hard for the stylist to see exactly what the problem with my color was.

Update: I just wanted to add that after seeing Sabrina today (April 11th) for the correction, I'm left with a much better impression overall. Thank you for making me happy! Both the color and the cut were fixed to my liking!

Contrary to all the previous amazing reviews, my experience was not up to par to my (high) expectations. I have purchased a Buytopia deal for 39 for ""cut, color or highlights, deep conditioning treatment, neck and shoulder massage, champagne and chocolates"". I also intended to do a color correction at this salon. I have booked a consultation session with Sabrina regarding the process, which went extremely well - we discussed and agreed on the color I wanted to achieve & Sabrina even snipped a lock of my hair to experiment the color correction treatment on. Needless to say, I was going into my appointment with extremely high hopes - sort of really excited to change up my color & having faith in stylists' work.
We have started off with the color ""stripping"" process so we could lighten up my very dark brown shade. The treatment didn't feel uncomfortable but at one point I could hear the girls chatting about the steps of this procedure and one of them told my stylist that she can Google it for her. That was a bit worrying. After the treatment was done, my hair was washed out a few times, and next the new color was applied. By the way, at no point during my 3 hour appoint was I offered water or the massage that my purchase was including. When I asked about the massage at the receptionist desk, she suggested that that it was done while I was getting my hair washed - how can a shoulder and a neck massage be given during the wash beats me. 
The coloring part of the appointment seemed to go well - my hair was washed off once again, Sabrina has assured me that it looks nice - from what I could see in the mirrors in the salon light it did look good. Next was my cut appointment with Melanie, who immediately assured me that she loves bobs & loves cutting them as well. I was under full impression that I will leave the salon with a fantastic cut. Well it wasn't - one side was left longer than the other which I noticed in the washroom mirror and went back to ask for a fix. For some reason Melanie insisted on layering the opposite side of my cut more..? After the first fix, I decided to fix my parting and noticed that one side is still longer than the other. My cut was basically done around my side parting - which would mean every time I change the spot where my hair parted, it would make one side longer. By this time Melanie's next client was waiting and she was seemingly in a rush to finish up with me. From what I could see the cut was fixed. Both girls have told me repeatedly that the color looks great. I've looked at my color at both the washroom mirror and the salon mirrors and everything looked good.
Like I mentioned, the massage wasn't done and neither was the champagne offered. The trouble started when I got home and looked in my mirror - the color was NOT what we agreed on. The roots are now darker and a big section of my hair looks brassy, and it goes back to brown on the ends. It seems that the new color was not able to set in properly to cover all the ""stripped"" sections. My cut is still not symmetrical, with one side being longer. I have called the salon immediately and we have made an appointment for Thursday to have the color fixed, somehow. To top it all, I think I'm having an allergy reaction to the treatment that I had done to strip the hair of color - the left side of my scalp is numb for 2 days now 
All in all I feel very let down - I have forgone the trip to my usual salon because I felt that their charge for color correction was very high, and decided to try out a ""deal"" place instead. I've had much better cuts in the past & my color, well I feel it would look much better if I just asked for a root touch-up instead.",Shopping
lqGbZMJ37kRyLlKlWzOAnA,EuHu9vgW6jHF4vCgvM1ZTw,p0iEUamJVp_QpaheE-Nz_g,2013-02-04,"Gonna try to fit this all within the word limit. All in all will *definitely* stay here again, but this our first stay was very iffy and we had issues.

Arrived for a Thursday-Saturday stay, room was $49 1st night and $60 2nd night. Hotel has 2000+ rooms, so it is not a small place.

Rooms
1) HUGE and clean. Liked the white comforters and sheets on the bed (because you can tell when white is dirty, ok). HUGE bathroom, cute designer type toiletries. Rainshower type showerhead, Lots of hot water, but you have to crank it up.
2) Yes, a lady who speaks little English came by at friggin' 9am on Friday morning knocking on all the doors announcing Housekeeping was ready to go. You could hear her coming so I got up before she knocked and woke us all up as we could not find the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. But hey, she came back at 10am too - they just want our rooms to be clean :) They did not come by on Saturday morning.
3) IDIOT front desk and\/or locksmith: in 12 hours we had to have our room keys redone 6 times!!!! They said they get demagnetized quickly - one key demagnetized from the time we opened the door to the time we retested it 30 SECONDS later!!! Not near cell phones, magnets, credit cards, radiation, etc.. The Security guard's **Master Key** also did not work and they had to call a guy to take the lock apart to let us in. Only got a new room Friday night. Manager was named Jason Presley (Say Priestly if you wanna piss him off) and he came to our room to make sure the keys worked... 5 minutes later in the NEW room, my key stopped working.
4) Coffeemaker with disposable filters and coffee packs, less mess, great coffee smell.
5) No in room fridge, maybe I am spoiled? I recall having a fridge in Vegas lots of times - not mini-bar but a fridge.
6) Longish hike through casino to the hotel elevators if you use parking garage or front entrance
7) STUPID Bell Service - they come get your stuff from the car, and even if you are standing there with your keys in hand, they MUST take your stuff to the Bell Desk, you walk to your room, then call them to bring it up. Do you understand - you are there with your room key, and they cannot come up with you!?!? Never had that happen at a hotel before.

Casino
1) The air system here is odd in that you walk in and it immediately feels stuffy as other reviewers have said, but it is not overpowering. Did not smell horses even though there was an equestrian event, however there appears to be a connecting hallway between equestrian center and hotel elevators, so maybe some folks got a whiff of horse.
2) Casino is pretty big, crazy amount of slots, lots of bars, like one every 20 feet.
Didn't really seem crowded. There were lots of cowboys for an event and bowlers and locals and we weren't bumping in to each other or anything.

Food
1) Seafood buffet overrated, but not bad for $19. Crab tasteless depending on the batch, decent variety (steamed clams, 2 salmons, crab hot and on ice, shrimp on ice, calamari, mussels, oysters, more but I forget and nothing really stood out). Save some time, look for crab legs at the other food stations - Italian, Mexican - if you want to avoid the long line at the Seafood station. Mashed potatoes rocked. Little fish ""dumplings"" were raw in the inside - gross! I think it was like rolled up halibut or whitefish in a cream sauce, still raw and cold on the inside - stupid to serve it without checking!
2) Coffee shop prices high\/average except for midnight $3.99 specials. Stupid to have $3.99 food then charge $2.99 for coffee. Asian food selection pricey compared to other hotel places catering to and trying to attract Asian clientele. Fast service, really nice servers.
3) Del Mar Deli - AWFUL PASTRAMI!!! I guess the sign saying ""We carry Boar's head Turkey Pastrami"" was a warning, but I thought it was a choice for people who don't eat red meat - Pastrami is supposed to be greasy, dripping and moist, Turkey pastrami is NOT pastrami!!!! Soooooo disappointing as I was looking forward to a hot pastrami and a beer. I didn't even finish the sandwich - just threw it out. Service is decent - call and order from your room for pick-up to save time waiting. $7 pizza and soda special, 1\/2 sandwiches other than pastrami are mile-high and worth the price. Crazy pastry case, yummy cakes and danishes. They even sell bagels by the dozen.

Bingo
1) LOVE the bingo! Big room, never crowded = better chances to win. Really nice staff, especially the two British ladies. 
2) Beverage service in Bingo bar iffy, loopy pregnant waitress on the night shift, carded my friend but then when my friend came back with ID said she didn't need it - WTF?

Misc
1) Bowling alley looked like a lot of fun. Lots of league bowlers it looks like. Graveyard Special Monday-Thursday $1 a game from midnight to 6am.
2) Movie theaters seemed popular, all first-run shows.
3) Free WiFi in the rooms, no password needed
4) Not sure if good for kids - bowling adults only after certain time, movies seemed rated R",Beauty

My boyfriend and I have had four fantastic experiences with both their product, and customer service which is why we will continue to buy from them in the future, Just as a pre amble let me just say I agree with the other reviewers the style of their furniture needs a major update, at the same price point you can get a more contemporary look elsewhere. However I understand that there is a sect of people that really feel comfortable with it. Also I have noticed they are offering a more high contemporary pieces. first experience was 2-3 years ago we bought our first mattress when we moved in to an apt together. We got a great deal, looked around and their prices couldn't be beat. We scheduled our delivery for the day we moved in. We only had a moving elevator for 2 hours. He said we would get a conformation call the night before and a courtesy call an hour before delivery. On moving day they were our only delivery that was in any way accommodating. They said sure no problem we will put your mattress right at the front of the truck so we can make your delivery window. They were so fast and polite even taking their shoes off when the new place was clearly a disaster. 

When we bought a house this year we bought a king sized bed from a store downtown and went to the brick for our mattress, we went to the mattress store on Dufferin. Norman the manager there was beyond helpful. He gave us a great deal on a king size with a mattress protector and again gave us a 180 day love it or return it guarantee and also was able to schedule for our moving day which was inconveniently the Saturday of Easter weekend ""not a problem"" he said. Well again the brick phoned to confirm the night before and the day of and was the first of our deliveries. They came 5 minutes into the window they gave us.. Our bed from another store  was supposed to be delivered that same day but didn't end up showing up when it finally did it required a box spring (something we were told it wouldn't require when we bought it) last minute we had to run around looking for a box spring.  The brick to the rescue again!  We called Norman that night he found one that fit the height of our bed and told us we could pick it up special the next day or even that night if we felt like it . Another great experience. 

Now we slept on the mattress for about two weeks and decided it wasn't for us. I don't return things often but I found it way too firm for my taste that being said others laid on it and thought it was perfect. Yesterday we went back and it was no problem at all.  They did not make it difficult to exchange the mattress and was even able to schedule a delivery for this Friday even though the new mattress was not in stock. This mattress was more expensive then the one we originally purchased but Norman fixed it so that we didn't have to pay any difference or delivery charge. 

    I have been looking around for a bedroom set for our new master since march. I couldn't find anything I really liked in the colour or style I wanted. I felt like I looked everywhere and if there was something I wanted it wouldn't come for ages (restoration hardware 12-14 weeks!). Also if you order from an American store they have to order it In from the US and you pay  the applicable international fees. Why should I end up paying close to double because I'm Canadian?   I have never bought actual furniture from any big box store but it seemed like our only option if we wanted our clothes off the floor and out of boxes soon. Our furniture is absolutely beautiful! no one would be able to tell it is the brick also we ordered it on Monday it came 5 minutes into the delivery window on Wednesday. It too was hugely discounted I think 30% off. It came fully assembled and the delivery people arranged it for us as well .",Shopping
1In46VYQQ6GWvzTvIhsqhw,gORMSwDEdgX8gYQzRVydLA,1xO2LvScpcMfl2BNm1aISg,2009-11-24,"On my my first trip to Vegas (yes ever) I wanted to go all out. So the morning after we flew in, I booked myself a morning at the spa. 

The entrance is lovely; you check it at a desk next to the salon and pay up front, which I really liked. You then walk through the gift shop (haha) to enter a long, stone hallway. There is water cascading down the walls, soft blue lighting; it really begins to set the mood for your experience. 

At the 'T' intersection, women go left, men go right. Yes, separate facilities. Lovely. 

At the desk, I was given a robe and slippers in my size and then given a short tour of the Roman Baths, the robe warmer (keeps it warm while you enjoy the baths), and given a locker. The 4 key lock for the locker was ridiculously easy to understand. 

After changing, I wandered to the waiting area; the Tea room, where a Tea sommelier prepares tea for you, according to your tastes or treatments. It's a lovely space, with lots of cushy seating. There are two fridges, filled with all sorts of fruit juices and water. As well as coffee, iced tea, water and snacks. 

My esthetician, Lisa, was very prompt, and led me through the crazy maze of treatment rooms. She left me to change and fill out the skin analysis form, which seemed to be a bit lacking in pertinent questions. I took maybe 2 minutes to fill out the form, and another 2 minutes to change. She knocked on the door 3 times in that span. Give a girl a second, okay?!

At the start of the facial, she seemed hurried and rushed. I guess my 4 minutes threw her off. And when she broke out the Clairsonic brush, all I could think was 'well, there goes $180 down the drain'. But as she relaxed and settled, I was able to as well. Her pace slowed, her touch became more methodical. 

At the end of the facial, I had lovely, un-angry skin and felt incredibly relaxed. It was an incredibly in-depth facial, with elements I'd never experienced before. 

I then took off to the Roman Baths...and realized I'd forgotten my suit. Well...it's suit-optional, so in I went! I started in the body temperature pool and then quickly doused myself in the cold and jumped into the hot. My skin was on icy-fire! It was amazing. At the back of each pool was a waterfall, and it felt amazing to let that pelt down on my head as my body was submerged. 

A few of the lounge chairs around the pool are made of stone and heated! Oh, that was heavenly. 

I also checked out the Arctic Ice Room, which was interesting. It's chilled to 55 degrees, with heated benches. The chute on the left side of the room delivers crushed ice for use in exfoliation and tiny purple\/blue LEDs light the space. Ever few minutes, tiny, tiny bits of foam\/snow rain down from the ceiling. It's pretty fun. :) 

I wasn't able to check out the steam room as my esthetician recommended against it. 

The dry sauna was delightful. Bone-melting-ly delightful. Not insanely hot, which I so appreciated. 

Once I was ready to leave, I hit the showers. Each shower has a small ante-room, for you to hang your robe\/clothing and it's completely out of the way of the shower. Lots of hooks and towel bars. The shower itself was great; three shower heads. The pressure could of been better....a lot better. But nice. 

The vanity\/bathroom area was lovely. Lots of seating space and great amenities provided. The moveable makeup mirrors were an amazing extra and I was able to take my sweet time getting ready for the day.
 
I spent about 2 hours total there and enjoyed (nearly) all of it. :)",Beauty

I love reviews because it gives another person the opportunity to learn somethings about what their experience maybe like... I really hate this had to end this way... I have gotten my hair done by Cyn 3 times now since June 2015. The very first time she did my hair I didn't like it as much I thought it was going to be something different but it did turn out to be cute... However the second time she did my hair it was fabulous I loved it I bought a lace front closure for 120 something dollars and she gave me a frontal natural part , a couple days later my hair lifted in the front where she sewed in my lace front closure which is awesome No Glue loved that technique .... When I texted her she was shocked that it came loose and I told her I didn't do anything and I didn't let my hair down until until later...then she kept saying this has never ever ever ever happened to me before I've never had a client have a problem with their install and I was like really.... Never ever wow nothing's ever perfect.... I wasn't blaming her that she did something wrong I just was letting her know that it came out and can she sew it back in.... Now here's a little bit about my hair I have a natural ""birth mark"" in the back of my head in the middle it is normally thin there. However it will grow back but always thin sometimes even bald.... Now what does that have to do with my front part of my hair coming loose I have pictures.... So naturally I got upset I picked up the phone and I called her because it sounded like through text she was ""bullying"" me about how broke off my hair was,but long enough to do an install,  I explained to her that I had did nothing but wrap my hair the  night that she did it and she said Oh Oh yeah that explains it you don't need to wrap your hair with this lace closure. I said okay I have told her in the beginning I have never had this procedure done.... Okay so we went back and forth with the time. I get it people have lives and families to attend to... SO DO I.... But what she did really only took about 5 mins that I felt bad she came in so early to accommodate me... I was really trying to fit it in at the end of the day but I have to drive 20 mins to her shop .Okay so that was over but I must admit I felt some kind of way and I didn't know if I was going to be returning for her services. But I realize that is hard to find a great stylist that can style my  hair the way I liked.... Now I'm not a hater I will give to her that she has a great craft however she is not humble in her spirit everything is always a confrontation (I have the text messages to show) it's never Awww  I'm sorry how can I help you how can I make it better it's always something you did wrong... i'm going to wrap this up last night threw me over the edge...I have been trying to contact Cyn since last Friday I left a text and I figured she will contact me the next morning which was Saturday or even in the evening I didn't expect to get me in right away... my text said that I was available next Friday Nov 13  the following Friday and the weekend if that works for her schedule to fix my hair again..... I had already knew how she was going to respond but I didn't think it was going to take five days she never answered my text so I did the next best thing and went on Instagram and of course I received the message right away a text message that is. I was wondering if it was anything wrong because I hadn't heard from her, but then I saw the Instagram post and that's why left the message on Instagram. I told her it seems like she was ignoring my text in which she was... And how that was unprofessional ( it usually takes a business 24- 48 hours to respond) not 5 days  she said she had over 200 messages and she doesn't do business via text oh yes you do!! I suggested since she says she pays someone to do her Instagram than maybe she should pay someone to manage her business phone... Who does this Young lady think she dealing with??? Also her website have always giving me problems she herself had said it was double booking so why always send someone to a website that gives you problems but doesn't have a problem taking your deposit......To make  a long story short of course she went off like I knew she would.... And said I was being disrespectful and she will not have a disrespectful client and that she is not the Stylist for me I said that's the first truth I heard from you... I agreed now mind  you I'm a professional I deal with people all the time I'm no where near negative or envious I love on people all the time... I'm just speaking truth. You be the judge of how your services go and I hope it goes well I do hope she change her ways with how she treats her clients.. I wish her nothing but the best in life. I give 2 stars because of the way she treats people and how jacked up my style is today 1 week later",Beauty
s1lB-rz37bs_YcjsOZWXEA,UyuWAvDcLp4zU1Wfc1PNXg,Wpd_2mn5d792KgPZUOOMHQ,2011-07-03,"The challenge for a place like 'the mint' is that it is trying to be sooooo many things at once. Somewhat of a restaurant, a dance club, a lounge, and that means people judge it on whatever category they think mot important. For me, I went to try the food. A work associate noted that her and her husband had been meaning to check it out and since I was going to a movie with some friends at Camelview I thought, what the hell, I like Asian Tapas, at least the ones I've had at Sens Asian Tapa bar downtown so I'll check this one out. I was leery of the lounge\/dance club aspect but I figured 7 pm was several hours before the late night party crowd would be out.

First thing I noticed was that even though it was early, the whole parking lot was blocked off for valet parking, and that was $7 even before tipping the valet. I mean, I understand setting that up about 9 pm but 7 pm, when you know it is basically a dinner crowd? Oh well, we parked, I shelled out my $7 and we went in to the place.

Once inside you see a large main room, with a bar to the far left, entrance to another bar area all the way to the back, and then tables and booths in the middle and lounge seating to the right. The primary wait staff was generally the pretty young woman group you see at Scottsdale bar though some key ones were wearing these slim black dresses with décolletage so that their...shall we say assets, were very much on display. But it is Scottsdale and it is also a lounge so....


*Update* I had initially noted that the Mint seemed to have copied the menu at Sens, a place I love. Well, the manager of the Mint replied that Johnny Chu, The owner and head chef at Sens is also the executive chef at the Mint, which explains why so many of the dishes are similar, same chef with modifications to items based on location.


 As our dishes started to arrive, and this must have been around 7:15 I noticed they started to turn up the music and it got pretty loud and once again i was thinking....can't we wait till a bit later...the party crowd has not arrived. 

Now, the food. The edamame with seal salt and truffle oil\/butter, wonderful. it was my favorite dish of the evening, and the Korean short ribs were pretty good as well. What, surprisingly, was not good, was the chicken wing lollipops, they use the mid part of the wing and not the drumstick and for me, it was actually kind of  gross. My group tried and we all agreed, ugh. 

We had some sort of spicy tofu dish, which was fried tofu in some sort of spicy sauce and it was good and my friend liked the Wasabi slider, which was was beef with some sort of Wasabi sauce, but it came on a piece of flat bread which looked like it was designed to fold and that did not work very well. I recommend they make actual sliders so that is easy to eat. 

As for service, the waitress recommended rice with the meal we said yes and we got one small single serving pot and you can tell they were designed for one per person so I ordered two more from the guy filling up the water and we had two different people come by to confirm we had...indeed, ordered more rice. I recommend the wait staff ask if everyone wants rice and avoid the confusion.

Look, if you want to out drinking and dancing late at night and hand out with the Scottsdale crowd this is probably a good late night lounge and even though the food is similar I like the lower music level and intimacy of Sens a bit more, though it is good to know Johnny Chu's menu is available in more than one place. Once again, big thanks to the Mint for the reply and letting my know why so much of their menu replicates what you can get at Sens downtown.",Restaurant

Let me just say right off the bat that I was thoroughly impressed with the clinic!  I happen to be in the middle of relocating to the area from Colorado and I caught a really nasty cold\/virus that has been going around (likely as a result of the stress of the move and new job).  I didn't go into Walgreens with the intent on going to the clinic but rather I was looking to find something that might help me breath a bit better as I was finding it difficult to take good, deep breaths without hacking my brains out and\/or feeling out of breath with even the slightest activity. With that said, I noticed the clinic and thought it would probably be a good idea to be seen if possible. I used their easy registration kiosk\/computer to set myself up for a walk in appointment (there are options to schedule an appointment also). There was only one person ahead of me so figured it likely wouldn't take too long and I was right. I waited for about 20 minutes which I thought was totally reasonable for a walk-in. I saw Jenny who is an NP (Nurse Practitioner) and she was awesome!  I definitely made the right choice to be seen because my pulse oximetry (Oxygen level) was quite low and Jenny was rightly concerned about that. She immediately gave me a Breathing Treatment and talk about night and day in terms of how I felt. My Oxygen level came up to where it needed to be during the treatment and while obviously I was still sick, I felt much better. Jenny spent a good 30 minutes or so with me and it didn't feel rushed at all (regular Dr might have spent 5-10 min tops). Jenny certainly showed that she cared about my health and I guess I just didn't expect that in the clinic setting. The main reason I am writing this review is because I never really thought about using a clinic like this one before and to be honest, were it not for the fact that I am new to the area, I likely wouldn't have this time but I am sure glad I did!!  I wish that I knew about the convenience of this option before and will be singing the praises of this clinic anytime someone I know has an illness that isn't critical or a true emergency. To be clear, do NOT go to this clinic if you think you may be having a heart attack  or some other life threatening emergency. GO TO THE ER AT A HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY!!  Also important to note, this office doesn't have the ability to do X-rays or sutures\/stitches so you would need to go to the ER or possibly Urgent Care (which is a bit of a bummer and the only reason I rated 4 instead of 5)
To summarize this somewhat lengthy review, for their intended purpose, this clinic is awesome and I will be utilizing them again in the future for basic healthcare needs. Jenny deserves a special shout out for really doing an excellent and taking the necessary time with me and caring about me!  I did also receive a call from the manager of the clinic with about 48 hours after my visit. She was checking on me to see how I was doing. 
One note, it is awesome that the clinic can transfer prescriptions electronically right to the pharmacy but I will mention to make sure you get what you are supposed to from the pharmacy. The NP specifically prescribed a device that she wanted me to use with the inhaler she prescribed (I saw it written in script) but the pharmacy didn't include it. Luckily before I left the store, I noticed it wasn't there. When I went back to the pharmacy counter, a fairly rude employee  (don't know if Tech or Pharmacist) said that the device doesn't come with the medication. I don't know why they would just ignore the instruction and not even speak to me about it. I stated that I needed to get one anyway and a pharmacist then walked over and I believe in an attempt to back up the other guy, stated the device ""must be prescribed"" and I told him it was, please go back and look at prescription. He did and immediately changed his demeanor and became helpful. He did go out of his way to help find a reasonable option because I had to pay cash for it and I did appreciate that. It was just disappointing that had I not known that I needed it and\/or fully understood the PA's instruction on how to take my medications, I would not have gotten the needed device. Anyway, I am NOT factoring this into my review because it has nothing g to do with the clinic.",Beauty

Let's be clear, as a customer, you can give them every single opportunity in to the world to admit some fault or wrong doing and they will dig their heels into the ground and give you every excuse under the sun why they are not responsible. If the employees aren't related by blood, the owner will tell you they are ""like family"" and while he doesn't say it, he's implying that keeping them happy is more important than keeping you as a customer, even when the employee is at fault.
  I had pool service with this company for a year. First I communicated with the man who serviced the pool himself. I asked him for a time card for him to fill out each time he was here. He said the company didn't have those. I asked for a day or two a week that he could guarantee being able to service the pool. According to him, impossible. It was whenever he felt like it and if he didn't bother to show up, I had no way to prove he had never completed the service. Multiple times I had to request he come because it was obvious he did not service the pool that week and if he had, he had done an extremely poor job.
  After a year of sending photos of my dirty pool to Eric, the man B & L enlisted to service my pool, I had an accident that caused an injury requiring physical therapy in the pool. Once I started using the pool every day, my disappointment with the lack of services I was paying for caused me to call B & L Pools directly. The phone was answered by an immature sounding employee, Marissa Benson, who as it turns out is the manager's daughter. I told her that once again, Eric had not showed up for over a week to service the pool and once again, it was gross. She promised to talk to Eric and get back to me. She didn't call back that day or the next morning so I called her back. Her solution was that Eric would be out later that day. No apologies or explanations for the poor service or her inability to return a call. I told her that was fine, but this kind of service needed to change. For instance, do they have a check off list or a card for Eric to leave for him to prove he was here every week? She said they did. I told her Eric had said the company did not have such a sheet. She gave no explanation or apology for why I was lied to and instead just said that she would have him bring a sheet his next service. Because her reaction made it seem like these kind of problems were standard, I wanted to let her know that I was simply not going to allow this kind of ""service"" to continue. I stated that I was going to be loud and obnoxious until I started getting the service I signed up for, weekly service that resulted in a pool that looked like someone spent more than five minutes cleaning it. I stated I had been polite and had asked Eric to do his job for nearly a year, which produced no results. Her response was in no way reassuring that service was going to get better. Immediately Marissa's defenses were up and she reacted to criticism of a business in the way young people often react -- as if you had criticized them. She raised her voice and said that if I was going to be loud and obnoxious, she didn't have to help and acted as if I needed to be grateful for sub-par pool service. She continued that they didn't have to guarantee a day of the week for weekly pool service. I understood that I was never going to get my pool service every Thursday at 9 a.m. But I thought it was beyond reasonable to ask for service to guarantee to be completed one of two days a week that they could pick. Her resistance makes me think that the reason they don't want to commit to service being completed on certain days allows them to scam people and do service every 10 days or 12 or whatever is convenient for them. Because Marissa was acting so childish and taking the whole thing so personally, I had to ask her if she owned the company, because in my experience, only people who own the company are that secure with unprofessional behavior. She told me she did not, so I asked to speak with a manager. She was happy to hand me over the manager, Blaine Benson, otherwise known as her dad.
  There's lot more including the owner, Dale Howard, defending all of his employees unprofessional behavior but Yelp only allows so much space. Feel free to check out the full review on the Better Business Bureau of AZ website. But the bottom line is these guys are liars and can't complete basic pool service. There are plenty of pool companies who actually want your business and will do a great job, B & L pools isn't one of them.",Shopping
aU5EGo8oa6ORdLs8JGm80g,RrJR7sNSbCD6EoxSkgOzZw,v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,2017-11-30,"I am a Trip Advisor top contributor and have the 5th most likes to my reviews in NYC. The reason why I want to highlight this is because i want to emphasize that I visit a lot of hotels every year especially hiltons because I have a card with them.

In my 20 odd years of travelling, this is by far the worst hotel I have ever come across.

We booked an Ocatilla room through Southwest Airlines. When we arrived Carlton Stokes (who is apparently the manager there) gave us a regular room. When I inquired why I did not get an Ocatilla lounge, (superior room) I was then told that they never got info from the airlines that I have a superior room. Now thats a lie. I showed him my confirmation email and then he said all he has is a superior 'accessible' room and he gave me that. That room had torn furniture, no tub and was completely out of order. I asked if I could be changed to a superior room, and was told that there are no rooms available. BIG LIE! 

I was travelling with toddlers and specifically took the superior rooms for their comfort. Next morning I spoke to the manager (Nick) and he changed us to a superior room. Was not sure how suddenly they got a room available for the length of my stay. Nick was acting as if he was doing me a favor while doing the swap. I paid for the superior room and its not my problem if their system is wrong. I showed them the proof and emailed it to them too.

Now the super pricey room (Ocatilla) comes with the following add ons as per their website and the piece of paper they give you...

1. Complimentary beer, wine & refreshments: This was the only saving grace along with the old white guy and the lady in the Ocatilla lobby who were very helpful.

2. Complimentary continental breakfast - This is just a few sweet puffs, fruits and yogurt. This is no breakfast. And they dont ensure its available all the times during breakfast. They say that this is available from 6:30AM but it aint available by around 7:15 AM.

3. Personal Ocatilla Concierge - to arrange your visit and tend to your needs - This is a joke. Never seen my personal concierge. I asked for the concierge and nobody knew of anything like that

4. Personalized ""morning start"" - coffee, tea or orange juice to your room upon request - Big Lie. Nobody gets them to your room. They did on day 1 and told us that they are not obligated to do so.

5. Therapeutic turndown bath - a hot bath drawn with soothing sea salts - Bigger lie. I asked them some 4-5 times and nobody knew what I was talking about. When I showed them the piece of paper on which it said about it, they said its not available anymore.

6. Pre-departure services arranged by your Ocatilla Concierge - airport transportation, printing airline boarding passes, shipping needs and rental car returns - OMG...an even bigger joke. There are a couple of computers there and you need to take care of yourself. Nobody knows nothing around there

7. Two-hour pressing service - guaranteed to keep your clothing fresh and crisp daily - Another joke. The staff of this hotel did not clean the dishes we left by the room entrance for two days. And they are promising on their website that they have a 2 hour service.

Added to the lies above, what makes this an even terrible hotel is the following...

- We head out one of the days and on our way out at around 9 AM, we specifically informed 3 staff personnel to clean our room by around 2PM. When we arrived to our surprise, nobody did nothing. I called up the manager and he said that they will clean by 430PM as per their contract with the service company. I have never heard an answer like that. After calling them again and again, they finally cleaned the room at 3:30PM.

- We asked the house keeping to send us some plates and they said they wont send them. We asked the guy at the Ocatilla lobby and this chap was the rudest ever saying that they dont give plates.

- I called the manager (Nick) asking him for the timings of the pool. His answer was 'we have 8 pools on property and everyone is open 24x7'. I go to the main pool and the slides are closed. The staff there told me that they open at 9AM. Thats how well he knows his hotel.

The Ocatilla wing is farthest from the parking lot and it takes a good 10 mins to walk and they do offer a ride on the goft carts but you have to call them and wait.

All in all I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. 

The staff at this hotel do not do their job properly. They are more interested in pushing the work to someone else or giving you some random answer than helping you out. 

You will basically ruin your vacation if you end up choosing this hotel.

I would rather stay in a motel on the street than come back or recommend this hotel. I wish Hilton hotels look into this nonsense and strip them off the Waldorf brand...

I should never have a reason to call the manager in a luxury brand hotel. unfortunately in this nonsense hotel, I had to speak to the manager every day",Beauty
Psqg7W7ex9nj5jCTzvizzA,rg77cgcdn84ROlv4JmEYWQ,FOqYmI24hSVP4EUibW-9zQ,2015-05-11,"My husband found this place based on reviews that he read on Yelp, it's also a plus that it's right down the street from our house. I came here for the first time for a Mother's Day treat from my husband. I was pretty excited about this, because as a full time working mom, and also pregnant with my second child,  I haven't really given myself a chance to be pampered in a long time. So here's my first time experience...
 
Walked in for my appointment and was told by the receptionist in the front to pick any colors I'd like. Another girl came up to me and told me that if I'm ready, my chair is available for me for my pedicure. I sat there for a few mins soaking my feet and during my wait I was offered to have something to drink which was a plus. And then finally I had someone come to me to get my pedicure started. The lady that did my feet was Lily. She was very kind, sweet and did an awesome job. The only negative thing I have to say was when a couple of the girls (the receptionist and another girl) hurrying her up towards the end of my pedicure. I'm assuming she had another appointment that needed to be attended to. I also want to add I did the Deluxe Package that includes a hot stone massage and paraffin wax so everything took a while to do and also costly. I understand that customers have appointments and it needs to be met on a timely manner, but to remind Lily in such an unprofessional way, to me, is unacceptable. Lily was taking her time with me, knowing the fact that it was my first time and ensuring that I have a great first time experience, but unfortunately her peers slightly ruined that for me. I appreciate that even though Lily was being told this, she remained calm and collected and made sure to still take her time. 

After my pedicure I was guided to go to another station for my manicure. The lady that did my nails is the manager. How did I know she was a manager? Because of her demeanor and I asked her if she was and she said yes. My first impression of her? She lacks people skills. I may be wrong,  but that was her first impression with me. She sat down and started doing work on my nails as she ordered her staff around at the same time. Didn't say ""hello"" or ""how are you"" to me, nothing. Well, I expected a little bit better for someone who is in charged but I guess I set my standards a little bit too high. As a matter of fact,  I almost let out a chuckle as she multi-tasked because it was  beginning to feel like this experience was a joke. I also am a manager, and I manage a multi-million dollar store that gets busy all the time...but I still am able to keep everything under control because I trust that my staff can handle the overwhelming demand. When your staff\/team is competent, micro-managing is unnecessary. And there was a lot of micro-managing happening during this time.  When you have been in the environment everyday where you know how a customer should be serviced\/treated, you kind of expect the same for yourself. Great quality service is what I look for especially when I'm trying out new places. In this case it started with a great service provided by Lily and then it kind of started going downhill from there. Although the manager did a great job on my nails and even made a good  suggestion to add another color that would go well underneath the glitter that I have already chosen, my experience with her was already tainted the moment she started. She could've sprinkled gold on my nails and I wouldn't have cared because the professionalism wasn't there nor any type of friendliness. She talked to her staff, ordered them around, as she chatted with another lady who she introduced to her staff as her grandmother. 

When dealing with a customer, the only focus should solely be the customer in front of you. And if you have to manage the place, give the task (of doing the manicure) to someone else that would provide their undivided attention ONLY to that customer. And if your short staffed and need to do the task yourself, I, your customer, shouldn't be the one to suffer such an experience on what should have been a great and a relaxing one.  

I didn't tell my husband about my overall experience because I didn't want him to feel bad for picking such a place that he paid a great amount of money for, (Ladies, this place ain't cheap!) . The only reason I gave this place 3 stars, which should've been a 2 is because of the wonderful service I had with Lily. The manager should thank her for a job well done. Lily is the type of worker\/employee that makes their bosses's working environment look good and Lily definitely earns a pat on the back. Also would I come back? Maybe, and if I did, I would set up an appointment with Lily to do my pedicure and definitely someone else to do my manicure.",Beauty
2BwZFtIv9mkpo4WqpKYf4g,dvPDmiAgS0yG60qeBh5HEw,XYeDsiDb4ZpflXTngrWnww,2012-09-19,"This is a fair reflection of what I have experience on the particular day I was there in mid-September 2012 with the particular hairdresser. Maybe other people are lucky and came later and things have improved, I cannot judge that. This is simple an account of my experience. Maybe because I didn't walk in there with a high end make-up, wearing a Prada purse and some Dior dress? Maybe this is why I got a second class treatment? I am sorry, I aint dressing to impress hairdressers, I need to take long ride in the subway, pick up my son from daycare and spend a day at university lab. A-a-anyway...
I came there by a Groupon (validated exploring new places), otherwise I wouldn't walk into a salon where haircut starts at $65. Anyway, for an expensive place in Yorkville as it tried to portray itself it screwed up on:
- for these prices, I shouldn't be made to listen to Kiss92 and their adds through my visit.They could buy a used CD player and borrow some CDs in the library or buy some in the thrift store if they're that cheap. This was a big put down. 
- it's a big place area-wise but the change room is tiny and was cramped with some supplies.
- There were three stuff (or four including a weird gentleman with a laptop at the front table, it wasn't a desk), yet, when I walked it, there were hair all over the floor around the chair where I was seated. It was mopped closer to the end of my stay, but in the two other Yorkville salons I've had it first free stuff would wipe the floor clean instead of hanging around.
- the girl that has done my cut had hair in her scissors pouch, which is both yucky and unsanitary. 
- the washing station had a very weirdly shaped thing (whatever it's called) where you place your head, it was actually very painful and my head has hurt in that place for 2 days after. I believe they're supposed to place a towel under, although I cannot recollect from other places.
- my hairdresser didn't ask me how I part my hair, she just proceeded to part it in the middle. Everywhere I've been to before has asked that, in my option, basic question, before doing any damage.
- I've asked for a wash-and-go cut and I've got something that looks just like one sticking-out-everywhere mess that is constantly in my eyes. Mind you, *usually* at least with all previous haircuts, my hair actually looks great after wash with no more than just brushing. My hubby likes this cut (very odd since he's very conservative), this perhaps is the only good thing. After it has grown out over a month and with a bit of trimming it finally looks ok after wash.
- the girl wasn't even able to style my hair by curling it outside, as I've asked. She was surprised when I did. Ok, yes, it's probably not the latest style, but whatever, this is what I wanted. I've ended up with the hair curled inside. And she didn't use any product to shape the hair.

Bottom line, spend your money elsewhere. Out of close by places I've been to Mark Anthony, Rosh Salon and Paul Pecorella with a much better (though perhaps not perfect) experience, which was just a bit more pricey (well, actually Rosh was a Groupon too and it was cheaper. It's kind of funny, I've actually complained that time that the guy took an hour on me but (just the cut and I had an appointment after) in the end it was a perfect haircut that didn't need small corrections afterwards - which is a natural thing for me as my straight hair do wave a bit an all sorts of funny directions that are not obvious on wet (or styled) hair, maybe I should go there again :-) )",Beauty
xni0798TFHJZ1u2aRkZaQg,_isjlAWhwxeCNMhjDuyd6Q,gOOdzjVxP7Z7bGjsstRjcw,2011-01-02,"Beer aficionados rejoice!

If you're like me, you're sick and tired of going out for dinner and having 3-5 draft beers to choose from. I'm thrilled if I can pull a beer not slapped with a ""Lite"" label; or when I ask for a stout the waitress has something other than Guinness to provide. I crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly named cheeses. I'm pretty sure, in fact, that the Saucer was created for people exactly like me.

Walking into the door I instantly get the same feeling of the hole-in-the-wall pubs I frequented back in college - just much larger. And cleaner! Almost every surface not walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense that your grandma's cabinet just shed a tear. It's cluttered but not oppressive, and again, it always feels clean and comfortable. There's a couched section up front for those really lazy days; elevated booths on the wall for small parties; and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize. And then there's the bar...

Bellying up to the bar at the Saucer is easy - it's roughly 50 feet long. From this bastion of beervana, you can see the real reason you came here - the jaw-dropping wall of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers. It's a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool's errand - you could easily down a pint just while trying to weigh the options. Thankfully, they have a well-organized (and four-page dense) beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you're looking for. I want to give some kind of feeling for what you'll find here, but the simple answer is - everything. I've had everything from double IPAs aged in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory coffee milk stout. Any style you could ever want, well, it's here. It's impressive. It's a little terrifying. It's very, very delicious. There are $3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well. Saturday's ""Beer Poker"" is my favorite - a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks. I've scored a few Victory and Rogue bottles there, so it is definitely not just the leftovers. 

As for the food, well... It's decent. Let's be fair, I'm not coming here for their burgers. Food at the saucer is a means to an end; the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews. That being said, there are a few musts on the menu. For a snack, you cannot beat the soft pretzels. You get two, they're huge, warm, salty and soft - if you're on a date and you don't get this, don't expect a second date. The brats are decent, the burgers have flavor, and oh yeah - spicy cheesy pepper tater tots. You'll find something. 

I guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service. A place with this diverse a beer selection could rest on its laurels, but the Saucer follows through with an excellent staff. Beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous smiling Beer Goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee-hi stockings... They're genuinely nice and know what they've got on the menu. Talking with them is talking with peers. They check in on the table frequently and always have a good recommendation on what beer is next. A few of them pay attention enough to recognize me and remember what I had on the last visit. Coming to the saucer is like hanging out with friends.

One last word of advice - if you're serious about your beer exploration, sign up for the UFO club. For $18 you get a commemorative t-shirt and a membership which clears you from (very infrequent) cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit. Drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor, a commemorative plate on the wall, and a $100 tab for a party for you and your friends. There's a reward every 50 - I just earned a free pint - and you get the benefit of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer. You will find new favorites and probably a few that you can't stand. But that's the point of the journey, now, isn't it?

So bottoms up, there's a lot to drink. As for me, I'm going to discuss with my Beer Goddess which brew is next on my list!",Restaurant

We arrived rather early in the morning since we drove to beat traffic so when we arrived around 9 am there was no room available for us.  So the held onto our luggage for us while we waited.  We waited till about 1pm which I was really bummed about because I am the type of person who would rather settle in before seeing the sites than the other way around but we didn't want to waste time by waiting in the lobby.  The neat thing about The Signature is that it's connected by tunnels and malls to the MGM Grand which is at the very beginning of the strip so you can easily walk through and access food courts, spas, pools, clothing stores, casinos, and fine dining, they even have the Cirque Du Soleil Ka theatre there as well as a Rainforest Cafe.  So we did our site seeing for a few hours and were called the moment a room became available.  When we got to our one bedroom suite you could tell they were in a hurry to clean it so we could get settled because the carpet was still wet from washing, there was women's underwear in the closet, and the bath robes didn't look replaced because they had hair stuck to them and one was a dingy off white.  The view is AMAZING!  You can see all the pretty lights at night and see really far in the day.  We happened to be placed on the side that had a view of the airport and surprisingly it was hardly ever loud because of it.  We heard a plane once or twice but other than that it was pretty peaceful.  Our suite came with a fully equipped kitchen including a dishwasher, fridge, oven, stove, microwave, as well as wine glasses, regular glasses, a toaster, a blender, pots, pans, forks, spoons, butter knives, steak knives, and more.  So we brought our own food to cook most of the time and it was nice to have home cooked meals away from home.  The master bathroom has a TV in it and is VERY spacious.  The shower was large and easy to step into but because of the way the glass door sealed it had a tendency to leak a bit of water.  Next to it is a very HUGE jet spa tub which is big enough for two!  Very relaxing.  

I would have to say my overall experience with this hotel was very nice, I think we must have caught them on an off weekend because when we were getting ready to check out we called around 1015 am for a luggage cart,  we waited till 11 am (which is when check out is) and called again for the cart.  We waited some more and then called for a third time at 1215 pm for a cart in which we were given an apology and a luggage cart arrived within 15 minutes.  We told the guy they must of been busy and he replied with a ""no not really, it's been slow this morning""   I can understand a request falling through the cracks but it shouldn't take three phone calls over the course of 2 hours to get a luggage cart.

Now don't get me wrong.  It is a very nice and peaceful hotel and I very much enjoyed the luxuries of the room and the hotel itself and my boyfriend had stayed here before and said he had a much better experience with no problems the last time he was there.

I also like that there are no casinos inside this hotel so its more relaxing and you don't have a bunch of idiots running around that aren't staying at the hotel  in fact at night around 9pm the doors connecting the signature to the MGM mall, automatically lock, and only those with a room key can get in.  and the entrance to the hotel is also gated and Valet parking is complimentary.",Beauty

I've been to Four Peaks between 15 and 30 times--this is one of the best spots in Tempe without a doubt. Through a beer class I took at ASU, I've also had the privilege of touring the brewery and comparing the equipment and techniques of other Tempe breweries such as Sleepy Dog, Electric Brewing (which I believe is now under new management and has changed names), and even Gordon Biersch. This is a very sanitary brewery that goes above and beyond just having pride in craft beer. Since Four Peaks has become so big and successful, they are able to budget experimenting with new techniques, ingredients, and temperatures which has enabled them to learn from and refine their regular processes and deliver their standard lineup of like 7 or 8 beers consistently at any time of year.  Furthermore, they often have unique seasonals that go beyond traditional beer--try to catch them when they have cask ale, barley wine, or something else out of the ordinary. You won't be disappointed  and you'll have had yourself a one-of-a-kind experience--I think they have a calendar online where you can track this stuff. Creative freedom is a huge asset for Four Peaks and it clearly shows. 

I've had a birthday at Four Peaks, many great game days, and I've even brought friends' parents here; this place is great for all (maybe not small children). The food is above average bar food (some pizza options, fish and chips, great burgers, etc.) and the seating arrangement is great. They DON'T have a\/c so the summers can get a bit rough if you're not in direct line of a mister or fan, but it's very pleasant at all other times. There was this one time however (here comes qualm reason #2), when I came back from a Thanksgiving in Chicago and decided to catch up with some friends at Four Peaks. I had just bought a new pea coat (go Black Friday shopping) and it was getting pretty cold at night this time of year, so I brought it along. Towards the end of our meal, I stepped out of the restaurant, realized that it was too cold and I forgot my coat, walked back inside, and it was GONE. What. The. Hell. I asked my server about it, talked to the bartender, spoke with the manager, called back every day for the next few days, anything I could to recover my coat. Nothing. I'm a bit disappointed with the management for not making this right because I'm pretty sure our shady server that night (who I haven't seen there since) took it. She was really uneasy when I approached her and kept directing me to different people I should talk to. She also slipped in something like ""someone came in and picked up a similar jacket tonight"" and then when I started asking more about it, she was standoffish. I told the manager this, hoping that maybe someone could at the very least buy me a beer since my coat vanished into thin air (I suppose this is my fault mostly, I admit that) at their establishment, but whatever. I replaced the pea coat the following Black Friday.

Park along the street or in the back when you come by, but I strongly suggest finding a ride or dusting off the old bike because you're going to want to spend a ""lager"" time here... hahaha... ha.... hah....",Restaurant
uKNzvxHJK1QxZdkLhjdRQA,qygModUyyK_Hi_b1uxSLFA,5qsjQ2FiMrtXGTmkhCWalw,2008-10-30,"I found myself in a bind (and not the kinky kind) last Friday when, after spending all my allotted ""costume shopping time"" dealing with car issues, I faced the threat of having to appear at a Halloween party sans costume. Quelle horreur! 

I had six hours to find a costume that would befit a woman of my fabulous reputation. Deciding that this was far more important than, you know, helping students scan documents or walking professors through checking their e-mail, I picked up the office phone and started making calls.

First I called Torrid. I wasn't thrilled at their selection, but I'm a fashion-minded plus-size girl, and they fit that niche. While I was tempted to get their flight attendant costume (I would've put on some corpse paint and gone as a ""Fright Attendant""...get it? Get it? Fuck you, tool, I know I'm funny), Misty S and I have a rule about dressing up as each other's parents. I don't dress up as a flight attendant, and she doesn't dress up in an air force uniform. It's helped save our relationship.

They had a Ms. Lovett costume (""The Barber's Mistress?"" Really?) but some hosebeast I work with and totally hate was going as that at another party, and she hand-made her costume and I could not possibly stand to have my costume compared to hers. So that went.

I got the idea to go as Little Red Riding Hood. Having exhausted my options at Torrid and not quite daring enough to risk the vomitorium that is Party City, I looked up Easley's. 

Back when I was a mere Theater major (you called it, huh?) Easley's was synonymous with ""knows their shit"". Everyone who took costuming\/cosplay\/halloween parties (too) seriously went there. It was a name I could trust. In fact, I still have all the makeup I've bought from them over the years tucked away in a First Aid box (one day someone will figure out it doesn't contain gauze...but until then I can't afford a new box). So I gave it a try.

""Easley's, how may I help you?""
""Yeah, I was looking on your site, do you have the Plus Size Miss Red Riding Hood costume in stock?""
*Sounds of checking inventory* ""No, we don't, but we do have the other one, with the long black skirt, and we found another one not on the site.""
""Describe it to me, please?""
""Corset with gold braiding, short black skirt, red hood.""
""Oh wow. That sounds perfect. Can I have you hold it for me so I can come by and see?""
""No. You have to pay for them online before we can hold them.""
""But you said it's not available online.""
""Oh, we're going to upload it to the site right now.""
""Oh, okay, I see it...but...there's no picture.""
""Yeah. We don't have a picture of it. It'll be $39.95.""
""Wait, I'm supposed to pay for this sight unseen? Can't you just set it aside? I'll be there in like an hour. I can't afford to pay for this, drive over there and find that it doesn't fit, I don't like it, etc.""
""Sorry, no, we can't.""
""Ugh, okay. Thank you.""

Desperate (and a little curious) I went to order the mystery costume, and what do you know, not only was it invisble, but shape-shifting. Once in my checkout cart the price had changed (WITH MAGIC!) to 53.95. 

I called back. And was put on hold.  

Yeah, that's great, Endlessly Looping Sound Clip, but I really don't give a shit about the rental policy. I just want my costume.

I ended up hanging up. I wasn't even sure I could afford the costume even if it was only 39.95.

So I went home, threw on the pink tafetta nightmare I wore at Fetish Prom, slipped on a domino mask and some high heeled boots and went as a prom queen dominatrix. I was the life of the party

I know it sounds a little harsh of me to give them a 3 star for this one mixup, but seriously, I've never needed to get plastic involved to get anyone to hold something for me. I don't see what makes Easley's so special. What are the odds of another full-figured girl walking in within that hour time frame screaming ""QUICK! I NEED A SEXY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD STAT!"" 

I say relatively low, but that's only because I don't want to imagine that there's another me out there in the world. I'm enough.

After the Halloween fervor I fully intend to stop by and see if they have that costume available still. Because it sounds fabulous. But I think it's important to know whether or not it'll make my ass look fat before I make the commitment.",Beauty
FyUsqOCjl_mZ-ki3g-6HAg,zo2vscKNvDzXWj7YOrdJVA,Cyy95sS5r6MGzgEA4UZX5g,2009-12-14,"It has taken me a while to figure out how to rate Parlour.

Parlour is not your regular salon.  It is a large room filled with artists.  If your experience with hair before has been stylists doing a fair to pretty good job, you will be impressed by Parlour.  The staff here take pride in their work and truly perform masterpieces.

A week ago I had my hair cut and coloured here, and really enjoyed it.  I wanted to wait a few days to see how the hair was working out and to sort out my ratings system.  Overall, 4 stars.  But, the breakdown is as such:

Decor: Okay.  The pictures on Yelp were taken a while back I think.  I guess I had high expectations as this place was top rated and raved about.  But, the couch could be replaced, there is paint chipped in the back and the green in the bathroom makes ya kinda dizzy.  There is however this amazing painting in the bathroom that I so love and want to have in my apartment!!!!  Decor rating: 3 stars

Hair cut:  I was fortunate enough to have Brionie cut my hair.  This girl is amazing!  Turns out, as I was waiting for Brionie to come into the salon, I was staring at this woman who looked so familiar but I couldn't place her.  Said woman sat next to me and had her hair coloured.  Turns out it was Brionie's mom and I had worked at the same law firm as her when I just got out of university.  Small effen world.

Brionie looked at my hair and decided to flat iron it first before cutting.  I was impressed.  I have very fine hair and by flat ironing it, she was able to give me va-va-voom layers that I have never been able to get my regular hair dresser to do.  *disclaimer - still love my regular hair dresser, Brionie is an artist and was able to sculpt my tresses into the ability to have Texan big hair opportunity if I so choose to do so*

I must also stress that Brionie has the touch of an angel.  Very, very gentle and relaxing!!  Highly, highly, highly recommend Brionie.  I will be back to have her cut my hair.  5+++++ stars!!!  Cost for hair cut - just over $60

Colour:  I noticed not many other people were getting their hair coloured (just Brionie's mom and I).  I thought this was kind of odd, but didn't pay too much attention to it.  Once Brionie gave me a kick ass hair cut, I was whisked off to get coloured by Francis (aka Franz).  Francis looked at my hair and listed to my thoughts.  I usually stick with a form of red and he found a colour that matched my skin tone PERFECTLY.  He highlighted in the right spots, and left other spots untouched.  The end result - a masterpiece that just ""highlighted"" my cut.  I was impressed.

I must also point out that when Francis washed my hair, I was in heaven.  My scalp and hair want to marry his fingers.  

When Francis styled my hair he even gave me some handy tips and did a great job!

Cost for hair colour - $145.  Yes, $145.  I wish I was lying or kidding here, alas I am not.  This is part of the reason that it took me so long to write this review.  I love the colour, but I cannot afford the price.  When I looked on Parlour's website, the costs were expensive, but within reason.  Had I known it was going to cost me that much to have my hair coloured by Francis, I wouldn't have done it.  That being said, again, I love the colour and have had tons of compliments.  I just can't justify the cost.  Overall colour - 5 stars, cost....1 star.

I will be back to Parlour, oh yes I will be back.  But, only for a cut.  I am also thinking with the prices they charge for colour that they could roll on some new paint and get a new couch and chair (the one you sit in to have your colour set is literally falling apart).

I was impressed that I was served coffee...which was awesome and greatly appreciated!!

A final note....check out Sergio.  There is something cute and different about him!!",Beauty
RWEVTIp79lXMy_XBJRin3w,EmeSXFWHiCd0JCZMeiedBw,TN89zi12H1TXgFoELFCE4w,2014-05-04,"Discreet, Intimate, and Las Vegas
Is this a lounge, nightclub, or the refractory period after a successful night in Las Vegas?

Speakeasy - It is not as easy as it sounds.  If you are unfamiliar with the prohibition era you need to know Las Vegas embodies speakeasies and Holly Madison has brought it back with a modern twist.  Like all speakeasies discretion is key.  Inconspicuously tucked in the corner the typical tourist may literally walk past this place because it is seemingly a small bar yet it is camouflaging the experiences within.  This was a soft opening.  With next to no advertisement the onus is on you.  My wife knew where to go.  

You'll see a car, but not the usual car surrounded by slot machines begging to be won. Next to it a well dressed, well groomed man to screen wanderers for the 21+ limit.  I casually struck up conversation and inserted the name of the bar like a secret pass-phrase.  The bouncer knew what I meant and told us the unique password that would grant my spouse and I access.  Tonight was ""Cold War"".  The secrecy and use of codes words threw me back in time to the age of illegal pleasures (and alcohol was illegal).  I moved toward the bar and then used this pass-phrase in a sentence.  ""I'm glad the cold war is over,"" and, reminiscent of a spy film, the secondary bouncer agreed in kind, allowing access to the bar.

When we finished our beverage we progressed to a wonderfully hidden passageway to enter 1923: Bourbon & Burlesque.  Tonight was the second night of operation, the ""soft opening.""  Everything was clean and crisp, and begged to be toured.  There is the cigar room with paintings on the wall demanding the masculine man to breathe in its offerings.  We found our seats on the ground level in front of the main ""stage.""  The bar may be appear small, but I prefer to say intimate.  You can mix and mingle with like minded persons, but I relaxed with my wife.

The bar is fairly priced for the strip.  

Now, to get to my review:  
Many of the men, from the bouncer outside to the band members inside wore the typical fedora or Newboy hat.  There were other hats of that era why not try them out?  See Cloche hat for women, or the Bowler, Homburg and Straw Boater for men. And the Cocktail servers looked like they came off their shift from dancing on the card tables.  Change their attire please.  You can still be sexy.  Speaking of, the cocktail waitresses were no where near the version of 1920s beauty.  See Christina Hendricks in Mad Men.  

I was not a fan of the DJ playing bass bumping music.  Was I in a speakeasy or an attempt at being another club?  Refer to The Great Gatsby and encourage use of the dance floor.  However, as the night progressed things changed from a club to speakeasy with a live band playing off to the side.  The band played mixed songs, more instrumentals of modern music which was perfect for me.  The volume was a bit too loud for my taste, it seemed I was yelling at my wife sitting right next to me.  Allow patrons to have an even conversation about their Vegas conquest without feeling like shouting.  

The Bar and service.  Service was great or perhaps they were overstaffed?  Cause of the soft open.  The first bar you see is the mixology bar, where they can work their magic conjuring any drink you desire.  I went to the secondary bar.  I was able to strike a conversation with the bartender, as though we already knew each other.  We shared a laugh and I enjoyed whiskey.  Oh, no ice please, I prefer whiskey stones.

Then there is the performances.  This makes everything worth it.  Remember how I said this was intimate? Well, if you don't have a good seat, then good luck. The layout is too flat, practically one leveled.  But we were lucky. 
The burlesque performances are supported by Holly Madison aka ""The Girl Next Door"" and she did not fail to put on a show.  Being so close quartered, performers secretly go on stage and the only queue is the change in music, which calmly pulls your attention to the show.  I don't think you'll find a more sultry respectable performance like this anywhere on the strip (and industrial is NOT the strip).  
The piano-singer interaction made me feel I was the only one tucked away in the forbidden speakeasy being serenaded.  One of the singers, even came down to the crowd to entertain us with her vocals.  SKYE .. With an ""E"" for EVERYTHING.  This was not all at once but spread throughout the night; however, I would prefer that someone sing between shows to add to the background band.

My wife and I went on the second night of their soft opening, so things may have changed.  So, why 5 stars?  Even though I have a few critiques I see all its potential.  Our hands on experience and the atmosphere made this local couple look forward to coming back.  Besides, you may run into a celebrity or two.",Restaurant
nK4VVnTkw3wPKa7Xn24hRw,3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,ZCQa7CJxZ-53Zxd_pobWug,2014-07-04,"I think it's sad that I'm writing a one star review about a restaurant on the strip. I don't write these often, but this just goes to show the level of frustaration I had during our visit here. I honestly had high hopes just because of the layout and facade of the restaurant, and I personally love cafes that are ""outdoor"".

Food: Food was mediocre. As far the variety on the menu, there wasn't much. We were there clearly for breakfast, but by the time our waitress Elvia came to our table, we asked if we could also see a lunch menu. There were five of us in our party so some of us ordered and shared our meals. I had the Corned Beef Hash, which wasn't bad, but I felt like the food was on the colder side. Our other companions also mentioned their fries were cold. My other friend who ordered the Foie Gras Burger said he wasn't too happy with his burger patty and his fries were also cold. 

Environment\/Ambiance: The cafe really added to the Paris theme of the hotel. There was a lot of seating indoor and even in the outdoor aspect part of the cafe. We requested there to be seated outdoors. Because the restaurant is part of the casino floor, it tends to be on the louder side. What made it even louder was that they were playing the World Cup on various televisions around the casino, including the restaurant. 

Service: For a restaurant on the strip, I expected better. When we were seated we waited a long time for someone to even offer us drinks. We noticed that although our table of five was in the middle of the outdoor seating area, no one could figure out who was waiting our table. We saw numerous times when the servers, hostess, and what looked like the manager kept talking about our table. We watched as other smaller tables were seated and attended to quickly. I was particularly hungry this day and I was not in the mood to be ignored especially when there were so many people around us enjoying their dining experience. It almost came to the point where we were looking for a manager to complain to. To our dismay, most of the workers around us were staring at the television to watch the game. I was particularly annoyed at the fact that we still had not been even asked about our drinks. One of the hostesses came out and apologized and said our server was coming out shortly...which was completely incorrect. By the time our server arrived, she seemed way too distracted to even welcome us to the restaurant. I was appalled when she came to the table and said ""Hello, I'll be your server today"" and then immediately walked away from the table to start collecting checks. Things like this happened with this particular server a few times. By the time our food was eventually served, another waitress took over our table. We had no idea that they switched servers on us. I'm not sure when this took place, but it may have had something to do with our food being pretty cold. I don't know if someone forgot to run our food, but at this point I was already very unhappy with our overall experience.

Tips: I honestly have nothing good to say about this dining experience. Sure, this was a restaurant on the strip, and it looks like a good place to dine, but the service aspect really killed it. I'm pretty sure I won't be dining here ever again.",Restaurant

That being said, I'm not sure that you get the same quality of service if you're not their type of preferred clientele and what I mean by that is: unless they're going to benefit from you coming in on their social media they probably don't give a shit. I've been twice....first time I waited about 30 mins past my appt time (it was nice that Hudson was super apologetic but the fact that he walked in holding fresh Starbucks drinks and I still waited once brought to the back pretty much diminished any apologies - in addition to the fact that Eva had been in the office the entire time unless there's a back door and in that case Hudson should have used it himself) and second time I waited about an hour past my appointment time. I looked up reviews before going and followed on Instagram and saw great work and what seemed to be great client relationships - photos and videos of clients who agreed to have themselves shared on social media and seemed genuinely happy to be in their office (studio?). I got Botox in my forehead and had also noted in my appointment request that I was interested in a consultation about having my lips done and looking into skin treatments. Hudson is super friendly, I can't say that I don't appreciate that and whether it's genuine or not he does a good job at making it seem like he is. Eva, on the other hand acted like she had no idea why I was there and pretty much just waited for me to talk and gave short answers. I got little information about the services I had wanted a consult on - didn't even give me any literature or pricing for products or services available or ask me if I'd be interested in scheduling anything. A far cry from how she comes across on Instagram. As for the service I did get. This was my 3rd time getting Botox and the previous place I went to the person administering it had told me that he didn't want to treat a certain area due to the fact that it would probably drop my eyelid. I asked her if she agreed and the response was ""Hmm no, I don't see why it would be a problem, but if it is, no big deal we'll just pop it back up"" so I allowed that area to be treated. While I wasn't super happy with the overall feel of the visit - to be honest it felt like she just wanted to get me out of there - because of all of the great reviews and work I had seen and the nonchalant response to my inquiry really seeming to make it as though she knew what was best, I trusted her. Two days later, eyelid starting to drop. Progressively got worse, texted Hudson and he set me up for a second appointment to fix it. At this point I wasn't even upset because she seemed so confident that we could just ""pop it back up"". I waited the full two weeks entirely understanding that any corrections shouldn't be made until the full effect has taken place. So yeah - 2nd appt like I said - waited at least an hour past my appointment time. This time there were two girls getting their lips done before me that I saw. I got in, got more injections - was told ""Yeah this should fix it no problem"" paid again and was on my way - I spent more time waiting in their facility than I did getting any services. Prior to the appt I had been making jokes with my husband that she was probably just going to drop my other eyelid and hope I was stupid enough to not notice. I honestly didn't think that, I truly thought my problem was going to be corrected. Funny thing is, that's actually what happened. Two dropped eyelids. Forehead is smooth as can be....but now both my eyes are half the size they were before. I understand everything I signed. I know that there's no real way of determining what will actually happen once these things are injected...but I'm disappointed in the fact that I trusted this professional opinion and ended up with exactly what I was concerned about. As far as that goes, live and learn, Botox wears off. But I won't be back and I will not recommend them to anyone. More than anything I feel like based on my personal experience there's no way there aren't more people that have left here feeling slighted but don't say anything because they have all positive reviews and a great social media presence.",Beauty

Firstly due to unforseen circumstances we were late to meet our appointment time to which i appreciated being advised that only the Shellac manicure would be done as treatments via Groupon were limited to 1 hour of treatment?, i was led to believe that Shellac manicure was an hours treatment in itself as there was also a Shellac pedicure i was a bit confused! we did ask if we could re-appoint for the pedicure but that was not Groupon policy to which we accepted, so we were asked to wait on the Nail Technician becoming available, we asked to use the toilet, there was NO toilet, we were told to ask at the Pub over the road!!!. We did reluctantly and relieved ourselfs and returned to the Nail Bar. Noticably the Technicians were very hostile therefore making us feel a tad awkward, feeling the reason for this was out late arrival and i had hoped this would fade!. The Groupon offer was very attractive offering you to take a bottle of wine and to have a catch up whilst having your treatment! Asi it was my friends birthday treat i took advantage of this and i asked for Wine Glasses i felt the place stop and i could feel the look for horror from all 3 Technicians, feeling i had said something wrong i referred back to the Groupon offer! Eventually i was given two wet glasses, i felt although i was doing something very wrong!!!! almost left feeling i had an alcohol problem, anyhow it was my friends Birthday and i was gonna allow us to enjoy that.Treatment began and i found myself very inquisitive asking her the process and as the technician was still being very hostile i felt myself asking more and more about the Shellac and manicure in a bid to soften the mood. To my amazement the only CND Shellac Product used was the Shellac polish, the base coat and top coat was another brand namely NSI, i asked why this was and i was told it was easier to use? my friend was asked to place her hand into the curing lamps that were placed either side of her hands, throught the treatment my friend continually asked if she could remove her hands between applications as she felt them hot\/ burning! the technician gave a nod!. I noticed other clients come and go, also noticed technicians disappear whilst clients sat on the bar stools, to my shock & horror i was told the technician was under the bar (desk) performing the pedicure on the clients, the clients has their feet placed onto a chrome pedal bin and the technician was on her knees working! OMG i thought and my friend whispered she was so glad not to be having her pedicure, she nor did i like the idea of the technician sitting below. very intimidating for both client and technician we thought!Anyhow i continued to question the Shellac process as i was very aware that with a CND Shellac manicure the process is a dry manicure that is finished with CND Solar Oil and a hand massage? the technitian had a completely different approach and technique, the nails were soaked with cuitcle softner and the Nails were buffed? this is why Shellac is supposed to be different to other Gel applications NO BUFFING! anyhow the treatment continued, the phone rang, the technician took herself to the phone and was there for a lengthly time, leaving my friend with the top coat on her nails without asking her to place her hand into the curing lamp,this top coat needs to be cured to seal on the other coats of polish applied to complete the treatment ensuring it is completely dry and the treatment is complete, so i advised her to place her hand under the lamp for a further (final)two minutes of the treatment whilst we waited, For a good job i did as the technitian came back no appology or nothing obviously she forgot what stage of the treatment she was at and finished by removing the sticky residue (final stage of treatment) that is left after the last coat is applied and cured (top coat) i mentioned this to the technician? she did not pause nor did she bother! the whole treatment could have been spoilt had I not known the process and completed the last stage myself, feeling i did the technician an IMPORTANT favour as my friends treatment would have been a complete waste of time!. No after care advice was given we were aksed to go sit at the waiting seats, the technician continued with the next client, without a thank you or getting our jackets, feeling totally alienated i was disgusted and embarassed i had bought this treat for my friend, never again although my friend made out she was delighted with her treat ( just to be polite), i had to ask another technician if she would kindly get our jackets and we left!. Big lesson, never to feel your getting a bargain as we certainly got more than we bargained for!!! No Customer service skills, no client safety, no client care\/ aftercare, no personality, for us NO RETURN! NO positive feedback! The quirky",Beauty

Despite knowing this, I still managed to go to First Markham Place in hopes to eat a decent meal with my dad. Since there are oh-so-many choices and a lot of waiting being done at most restaurants during lunch hour, I decided to try something new. With some consideration of the ""Grand Opening"" banner outside, we chose this eatery for a Father's Day lunch, what are the odds?

-----Food: Appetizing-----
Noodle Omelette  --  At first, I had really no idea what I was going to get, the only thing idea thing that I could relate to was the Japanese Omurice, that is, replaced with some sort of noodles. And I was correct. When the waitress brought me the dish, all I could say is that the presentation baffled me. It was made exactly as shown on the menu with mayonnaise, ketchup and Tonkatsu sauce artfully drizzled right on top of the omelette. Unlike some restaurants, they actually wrapped the omelette around the contents, in this case, the noodles. Speaking about the noodles, I've got to praise a heck lot about it. They were not all stuck together, not too oily, got the right amount of flavoring, has pieces of grilled pork and was decently stir-fryed! The grilled vegetables and sauces from the top of the omelette complimented the noodles well. The best part is, this is actually served with a salad and miso soup. End point: Highly recommended!

Gyoza  --  In terms of frying, they certainly did a good job on it, the bottom was nice and crispy. The skin was thin and not too thick. However, the filling I found average, and just a heads up, there are also Chinese chives wrapped into the filling.

Okonomiyaki  --  Like the Noodle Omelette, it was served exactly as photographed. Its serving is very generous, however it was way too thick. The top and bottom was made well, crispy and topped with sauce. The middle however tasted a bit funny to me. The mixture had cheese (very filling), lettuce, octopus, shrimp and the pink Japanese side ginger. I have no idea why they decided to include the shrimp and ginger, because it made the pancake taste fishy and strange. Generally speaking, I think I would have been much better if there were more lettuce in between the Okonomiyaki. 

Tonkotsu Ramen  --  Pretty darn good! Nowadays, many restaurants don't bother creating different soup bases for each one of their noodles or ramen, and Sonoya begs to differ. The tonkotsu soup base goes great with their noodles and best of all, it wasn't too salty! The tonkotsu (Japanese style pork) itself, was flavourful and the egg--oh my, it was cooked beautifully! 

Shio Ramen  --  The same can be applied from the Tonkotsu Ramen. In my opinion, I thought that this one was a bit lighter in taste and really well seasoned. As a side note, this is also served in a clear soup base. 

-----Atmosphere: Good-----
Partially because it is a new business, so the place is well lit and very clean. The overall decor was done nicely to reflect a modern Japanese noodle house. The chairs and table were at an appropriate height and despite being wooden, they were quite comfortable. Noise level wasn't too bad. And props to them for having AC! 

-----Service: Good-----
There was only one waitress who had a Korean accent, but I felt that she could still proficiently understand English. But I could tell that she still struggled to serve the entire restaurant as lunch hour progressed. Some tables were still left uncleaned, but at the end of the day, she still held through! For the most part she was really nice, and brought the food out quickly while it was still piping hot. 

*-----Final Thoughts-----*
Very happy with this new find, will definitely come again!

Go here. Dave Scearce is an amazing artist and a genuinely nice guy. I've spent a lot of time in the shop this year and have seen the other artists' work as well. Lots of fantastic people there.

Prologue

When I was looking for a tattoo studio to custom craft a full color sleeve for me, I took my time searching. At the time I started the sleeve, I lived almost 2 hours away from BST Tattoo, but decided to go there anyways because I simply could not find a studio anywhere close to me that I trusted to tattoo a large and prominent part of my body.

The Search.

I started looking for tattoo studios in April of 2012. I had been thinking about a concept for about 3-4 years and was finally at the point in my life where I could spend the tine and money to get the full sleeve done that had been a goal for so long. I started looking up artists and shops in my local area and couldn't find an artist whose style I liked AND that I would trust with such a large piece. There were plenty of ""tattoo mills"" (pick a piece of flash off the wall and we'll do it wherever you want it) around and I was looking for custom work based on my images and concept. So I broadened the search. I started searching on http:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/tattoos\/ and came upon a tattoo of a Corgie (http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/JsEuM.jpg) that Dave Scearce had done. I saw he was in Charlotte and that pretty much sealed the deal in my mind that i was at least going in for a consultation.

The Consultation

I gathered a few reference photos of sleeves similar to the style and content I was looking for and brought it in for a quick consultation with Dave. At this point, he didn't know me from ""Adam"" or how serious I was about getting the tattoo. He still took a few minutes to talk with me about my idea and to look at the photos I brought in. I showed him some of the ideas I found and some of my reference photos on my iPad. He looked at me and said (in the most serious tone you could imagine), ""I can do a better sleeve for you than those.""
Done. Deal sealed.
I loved his confidence in his craft and the fact that he was also excited about the concept (underwater scene). I talked to my significant other and a few days later put a deposit down to start this multi-session tattoo.

The Shop

The shop is VERY clean. I was amazed when I saw Dave wiping down the floor with alcohol in preparation to start my tattoo. They're NUTS about cleanliness and making sure you're safe. It definitely put me at ease for my first tattoo of significant size. The staff is friendly and the other artists are interested in each others' work. There's all sorts of neat artwork on the walls to look at when you're taking breaks from tattooing.

The Process

On my first visit I brought Dave a lot of images--way too many. Dave works well collaboratively with others and so we just started talking about what i wanted where and how it would fit together into a cohesive piece. After he got a broad idea of the things I wanted, we started printing out the photos (general rule of thumb - do your artist a favor and bring in the images already printed... don't rely on them to print them for you).
Then we got started.
Dave completely FREEHANDED everything onto my skin--no stencil or transfer. I was amazed at the process where he would refine the image from general shapes to fine lines. That process took a little bit for the size of a tattoo I was getting and we finally started tattooing. I was there for a total of over 30 hours in the chair. Dave and I talked... a LOT during that time, and I can say that I think we became friends. He genuinely took an interest in things that were going on in my life at the time. When we came upon a part where I didn't necessarily know what I wanted to fill the area of my arm, Dave would offer up suggestions of what he thought would work well. I wound up with quite a few things integrated into my sleeve that I would have never thought about and that weren't in the original plan, but it all works together wonderfully.

The Final Result

I'm completely ecstatic with my full color sleeve. I've had people tell me that it looks ""painted on""  and that it's the ""best executed sleeve"" they've ever seen. I'm completely in awe at the raw artistic vision and talent that Dave has. I know I'm going to love this custom piece of artwork I have for the rest of my life. I've accomplished a life goal thanks to Blood, Sweat & Tears Tattoo. If you'd like to see my sleeve, click here: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QPyjy.jpg

Maggiano's  also offers a little more reserved dining than the cheese cake factory which sits across the promenade.   We don't eat Italian out much (both having grown up  with parents once removed from the old country and with additional family living in Boston's North End where Italian restaurants and bakeries hire cousin joey for the sole reason he can speak English),  so we're hard to please being transplanted in the south.  
The décor is nice and it was fairly quiet.  You notice that most of the wait staff are young people.  Our waiter spoke so softly we had to tell him to speak up.  He was a little eccentric and seemed to be inexperienced somewhat but he was pleasant and caring.  We enjoyed having him serve us.   We walked in at 3:15 and received the dinner menu which mirrors the lunch but more money.  The food was leagues above your normal run of the mill chain Italian restaurant as the likes of a Carrabba's ""Italian Grill"".  
We started with stuffed mushrooms.  These were to be spinach, garlic with breadcrumbs.  I was looking forward to these.  They came six on the plate, decent size caps with a nice browning on the top and were absolutely tasteless.  BUMMA!   Not only were they tasteless but my wife spit out what looked like a piece of wrapping that was baked into the middle. Whatever it was, it was definitely plastic and therefore not digestible.  We brought it to our waiters attention who inspected it and said with a straight face ""that's disgusting"" followed by and apology and quickly removed the plate.  After he left we chuckled as it was quite humorous.  Don't think his manager would choose to have him say the word disgusting to diners!  Our waiter quickly returned to the table to notified us he had told the manager and ""put it into his hands"" so we should be hearing from him.  Again he made us laugh since he was obviously more grossed out than my wife and wanted no part of it.   The manager came shortly after and offered us a fresh order or something else free of charge.  We politely declined and thank him for his offer.  I had the chicken parm and it came with a side of spags.  The parm had a marinara sauce and the spags a house tomato. The menu read;  Chicken Parmesan Provolone & Marinara Sauce with Spaghetti  Marinara.   I'm assuming the sauces start off with the same base that gets shipped out to the 22 states they're in and they season from there.   The house on my side was most likely a mix up out back.  The marinara was decent!   I thought it could have used a little more oregano but I'm a huge fan of oregano.  I complain to my mom for not using enough.  The house was a little sweet for me and I only had a few forkfuls.  The chicken was thinly sliced from frozen cutlet with a piece of provolone on the top and baked.  Although from frozen, it was decent.  I ate them all.  My wife had the eggplant and she said it was decent too.  It came on a bed of spags and was more than enough for late lunch.  
Our check came with a take home order and a piece of cheese cake on the house.  The mushrooms had been deducted from our check.  We added the 9.95 mushroom deduct to the tip because the waiter made us smile and seemed like a good kid.
This was our first time to a Maggiano's.   It's unlikely we will return to Maggiano's.  If you're going out to dinner during your shopping and don't feel like the food court then it's in the running.  I can't see anyone driving to Maggiano's for dinner. There are way better choices all around the south park area.    I did see that they had family style portions on the menu and looks like it may be a good place for special occasions and\/or large groups.",Restaurant

Who's it for?: Hungry pasta lovers, people in the area looking for a slightly upscale, Italian meal.
Service: 9\/10 (wait 'till you see the number of service staff)
Food: 7\/10 (I'd usually rate this closer to 6)
Value: 8\/10 if you eat a good bit and do the tasting trio, 6\/10 otherwise
Decor\/Environment: Slightly upscale
Recommend or not?: Recommend if you are in a group of pasta lovers, otherwise no.

Full Review:
Lidia's is a slightly upscale Italian restaurant located on Smallman Street.  For those who are regulars, the ""signature"" item on the menu is ""Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio"", an ""as much as you can eat"" of three different kinds of pasta that are updated daily.  This is definitely the highlight for me as well since the rest of the menu, while not bad, don't seem to be a good value for me

Service 9\/10:
This, to me, is Lidia's best point as of this review.  While slightly odd, Lidia's boasts a RIDICULOUS number of service staff.  The record of different faces I've seen who have waited on my table was six with the latest visit numbering five.  Usually, this results with your table being waited on promptly and not being left in the cold during your meal.  

As for the servers themselves, historically (and for the most recent visit), they are absolutely solid.  While you may see some referring to some notes when they read off certain specials or the daily trio, I've yet to encounter someone that had no idea what they were doing.  In addition, they have almost always been friendly and attentive to their work as it is needed.

Everett was the stand out person during service for me today.  He was busing and was full of energy with a happy attitude.  Honestly, this really made a huge difference this visit that I even felt it warranted something extra to really give him a big thumbs up but he was exceptional (the other service staff on this visit were great too)!

Food 7\/10:
This is the real shame for me.  The food itself is not that great.  It's alright and every now and again you'll have a gem within the pasta trio while other times it just ends up being a mess on your plate of (sometimes) watery pasta.  While I will acknowledge that the independent entrees (AKA, not trio) are better in quality, this is not exactly an amazing experience for any diner.  I particularly avoid the salad and desserts as they've never really amazed me (the tiramisu came the closest but 

The one thing that I find always to be a plus (while I passed on it this time because it didn't quite make sense since i was alone to review the place) is the bread offering.  It is awesome with different kinds of bread with two types of spread (one salmon based and the other bean if I recall).  If you're in a group, you will survive the wait to the main course.

To me, if I had to point at one thing that ends up being underwhelming, is perhaps the seasoning and general food prep.  The trio can be particularly hit hard on this point because they're constantly cooking up more but the quality fluctuates wildly to the point where I actually made it a point to visit today right at the start of dinner service to see if there was a difference on the first prep and it was amazing at how the quality went on a roller coaster ride.  Maybe it's a lack of excitement for the menu or just a general complacency but the food really can't be counted on to be the best in flavor.

Value (8\/10 if a big eater of pasta, 6\/10 otherwise):
This comes down to the price versus quality.  It just doesn't make sense to me if you come here for anything besides the trio for your dollar.  The food just isn't up to par to other comparable competitors.  Even with the trio, it can be kinda hit and miss depending upon what food is available that day (for me, my cardinal rule is to look out for mushrooms in their lineup or weekend service).  So if you just want to scarf down pasta, you'll probably get a decent bang for the buck.  Otherwise, you're out of luck. 

Decor\/Environment:
As per usual, I don't give a score for this since people have different tastes.  It passes the cleanliness check and avoids anything that would really ruin a dining experience in my opinion.  Bathrooms are well kept (from my experience anyways) and tables aren't squished together.  It is a little towards upscale but you'll see plenty of people in casual wear dining here (often people heading to a ballgame or having stopped by the history center or something pop up).

Final thoughts:
I really wish I could recommend this place as an all around good place to dine but it really isn't UNLESS you eat a lot of pasta.  

Tip for reading to the end: Call ahead to get the trio listing for the day and see if it matches with what you'd want to eat and go in a group.  I would even see if you can get seated at the start of service if you don't mind the dining area being a little more sparse just because your service level will probably be better.",Restaurant

Long story short they did a horrible job on my nails. Got called a cry baby by the nail tech and manager said she didn't want me complaining\/bother her or wasting her time! I refused to go off inside the salon instead I called afterwards and tried to speak with a manager and she was being a fool talking in different languages and putting other people on the phone. She hung up on me several times and she said she would fix my oval\/squared almond nails. She was a 9 yr tech professional who can fix anything and I told her she would give me a new set at no extra charge and she said NO it would take her too long to do so I went home took them off myself and got a new set with TYSON the next day! 

Detailed review under! 
 
First off these people don't even have their Licenses or permits displayed for any customer to see! They judge you just by looking at you and what kind of cash they THINK you are carrying in your pocket! Don't go around speaking about people in your "" SECRET LANGUAGE "" when they understand every word you are saying. I came in and decided to just get the basic full set reg Polish with a clear gel coat. They told me yes 30$ so I waited thinking I was going to get Tyson ( my go to nail tech ) and instead I got some other man. He was harsh and did things fast just to get me out his chair. Halfway through my set he asked how do you want them I said SQUARED which didn't happen. I was super beyond upset by the time he asked me to wash my hands I looked at my nails and said nu-uhh this is not what I want and he said hurry I need to color nail. So I then asked can you do clear gel coat on top of my reg Polish which by the way in California I WOULD ALWAYS do this and never had a problem and always paid extra for it! He took out the machine and was going to do it when his manager started telling him I need to pay more $$$ if I want and that I need to get there gel colors not a reg Polish + clear gel

Then his manager went on explaining that he never said he could when I clearly asked 5 x before sitting down. I don't mind paying extra for the gel colors they have but don't agree to what I'm saying if you can't understand what I'm asking for. This man proceeds to tell me "" I do clear gel, it cracks and you cry like baby, me no want no complains! "" I'm on the phone with my best friend and she was shocked just as I was when this man starts telling me this in front off the whole salon! So I stay quiet let him have his shine for the moment he hurries me up because he's busy and paints my nails crappy Then grabs my stuff and tells me sit there dry 10 min and takes my money and leaves.

I refused to sit there after that horrible service and left embarrassed! I called as soon as I got home and the manager ignored me hung up on me insulted me and even screamed at me! I am a grown woman and let me tell you that I will not have anther woman scream at me in any kind of way. I repeatedly explained to her that if it wasn't for her customers she wouldn't even have or be a manager at any salon so why treat them like crap! She said I fix for you and I said no I want a brand new set she insisted that she didn't have time and hung up on me. I called her again and told her this better be the last time you hang up on me because then we are really going to have problems you shouldn't treat people like this after the horrible experience you just gave them. I took off my nails at home went in the next and when I was pulling up there was the nail tech smoking his nasty cigarettes outside. He even worked up the nerve to ask me why was I back, if I didn't like his work (all sarcastic) and I answered no sir your nail work is the most horrendous thing I've had in my life. I was late for my appointment but stuck around and hour and half to wait for Tyson! Sure enough we had some good laughs at this mans work even showed a few people at the salon the pictures of his work including his manager WHO DID NOT HAVE ONE WORD TO SAY ABOUT HIS WORK JUST FAKED SMILED AND STARED THIS GUY DOWN. I then told her and you're calling me a liar, pictures don't lie I wouldn't make a big fuss for nothing! Tyson did his job like always I payed him for his work and got my free set. I believe it isn't fair for one man to loose because of another's mistakes especially in the nail world! It's hard to find a good nail tech and it's even harder to find a male technician who is actually talented! I will only go back for TYSON and that's it!",Beauty
oebf669s7F6l9lIe0eObVA,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,Eg_M8eeu9SDEdbP7iUmVbQ,2012-02-05,"Dateline 1995: I am a student with no girlfriend at the University of Pittsburgh. All that stands across from Hillman Library is a hot dog cart, a Chinese food truck, and a shaved ice vendor. 

Dateline 2012: I'm a warehouse laborer with a girlfriend who works for a mortgage lender. She picks me up on Friday evening, and without a plan in mind, I direct her towards The Porch. I am shocked at how built-up Schenley Drive now is. I am particularly mesmerized at this strange, new, Modernist\/Art Deco restaurant we are about to enter, even more so over the fact that it is owned by Eat 'n Park, that ubiquitous local chain eatery staple we either adore or despise.

The Porch's bill of fare is somewhat small, but each item is intriguing enough to make deciding on what to order difficult.

Kay wanted the Farm Bread as an appetizer. I volleyed between Pork Belly and Shrimp & Grits before landing on the latter. Kay still wanted the inexpensive Farm Bread, so we ordered both and did not regret doing so. 

The grits were closer to a buttery polenta, a golden pool of richness that the sublimely sauteed shrimp floated atop of. Kale finished off the plate, and I finished it all off in minutes, rationing chunks of the meaty shrimp, dragging them through the polenta and from there, mouth-ward, savoring the creamy, the juicy, the oceanborne, the elegantly Southern. 

Onto something straight from the early morning hours: Farm Bread. According to our bubbly, youthful student server whose name I cannot recall, everything is housemade, including the large sheets of white bread, and the honey butter, apple butter, and jam that come with it in small, metallic ramekins. The bread had a chewy, flour-dusted hide as well as plush innards that seemed to nearly evaporate. This is not bread one wolfs down with eggs, however. Instead, you break off pieces from the massive cuts, slather them with each of the three amazing condiments: one sweet, one sweet and lardy, and one tart enough to enliven the dead before slowly partaking. 

Successfully resisting the allure of the fiery oven which promised choice pizza, or the fact that their burgers are freshly ground on the premises, I went with the Duck Legs. Oily, briny, skin crisping, meat melting, they sat on a bed of two potato galettes, each imbibed with the essence of the humbly mystical parsnip, flanked by a gaggle of flowery chanterelles, and lying in a potent puddle of Sherry reduction. 

As I ate...slowly, relishing what was before me, I had to keep telling myself  that the same company responsible for the Superburger was also behind one of the most ornately gourmet entrees I have ever had. 

And if that didn't suffice, clots of foie gras, something I'd never had before until Friday night, were strewn across the entirety of the dish.Their angelic, salty, smooth decadence left me wanting so much more. This wasn't just a dinner; this was a gift to those who love food. 

Kay's Chicken Roti defeated her. The rotiserrie chicken came with a cube of Hazlenut dressing, fennel sausage, apple chunks, and a demi-glace of roasted shallots. The dressing, called a ""bread pudding,"" was ethereal. The chicken breast I finished for Kay was unbelievably moist and supple. Traditionalists, take heed. This is your dish at Porch. 

Our duo of desserts were exemplary but hard to finish. My brick-sized Chocolate Bread Pudding had only a hint of chocolate, the better to focus on the heavenly heft of the sweet stuffing itself. A compelling case for the reuse of stale bread had been made and was topped with a colossal scoop of SCRATCH whipped cream that almost had the consistency of gelato. Raisins garnished the plate beautifully and palatably. 

Kay's Chocolate Apricot torte was also covered in the whipped cream. I had a taste and found its light flavor refreshing, the apricots getting on well with the cocoa. 

The waitstaff was exceedingly friendly and competent. It is also worth mentioning that with all of the racial discrimination lawsuits against restaurants making the news lately, it was very encouraging to see that The Porch employs a good number of African-American servers. In fact, around half of the waiters and waitresses were black, and everyone we saw appeared to be enthusiastic about working for such a brilliant new restaurant. I hope that The Porch achieves national recognition for their food, environment, and progressive hiring practices.",Restaurant
dSApd-AyRZtfY7K7ab0noA,w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,H_FkQxifSo13B2FWjhp36g,2011-01-16,"Las Vegas is Disneyland for adults and dining at Enoteca Otto Pizzeria in the Venetian is a pretty good representation of that.  Enoteca Otto Pizzeria has both indoor and outdoor (or pseudo outdoor) dining here.  To get the maximum faux design, you will want to eat in their outdoor dining area that is modeled after an Italian train station.

The pseudo outdoor area has nice tables.  At the center of the restaurant is a cylinder train tower that appears to be used for curing meats.  The canal shoppes surround this restaurant (fake buildings, statues that come to life and that blue sky, which I think looks better here than the skies at the Forum Shops or Paris).

Otto (as well as its surroundings) features that Disneyfied decor\/atmosphere, but it also has the backing of a celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  We went here for lunch and the pricing was reasonable (when compared to the many overpriced Vegas restaurants).  Pizzas went about $18 while pastas were about $20 or less.  You would expect to pay at least that for most sit-down restaurants in nice Vegas casinos.

The complimentary bread was packaged crispy breadsticks followed by focaccia bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  Standard stuff.

We ordered the tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula pizza.  This is one of the better pizzas Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton serve at Pizzeria Mozza in West Hollywood.  This pizza at Otto was okay but not great.  The pizzas had a thin and crispy crust, but it lacked both the flavor and the chewy and crispy texture of the Mozza crust.
 
The flavor of the pizza at Otto was okay.  It was a little salty, but that is kind of common with these prosciutto pizzas.  The pizza had too much tomato sauce as it oozed out with each bite.

We also had the Brussels sprouts with pancetta.  Brussels sprouts can be a little off-putting, but I have had good versions of it like the Brussels sprouts salad with vibrant fruit at The Bazaar or the tender Brussels sprouts with salty pancetta and creamy parsnip puree at AOC.  These Brussels sprouts were boring in flavor.

In addition, the pancetta was not good.  It did not really taste like pancetta.  Instead, it tasted like country ham.  While I was not a big fan of the flavor, they were definitely generous with the portion size.

Before ordering, the staff informed me that none of their pastas were housemade.  It was disappointing, but we forged ahead and went with a thick spaghetti dish that came with tomato, cured pork and onion.  Unfortunately, the pasta was served a little cold.  Also, the tomato sauce looked like it had dried on the spaghetti; it appeared that it had been sitting around for a while (it also had that appearance of re-heated pasta though I doubt the cooks would do that here).

The flavor was not that great.  It just tasted liked cold tomato sauce. There was not much of the pork and onion.  My friends really did not enjoy the dish and asked the server to remove the dish.  Not something I would do.  No matter how bad I usually eat whatever is put in front of me.  What can I say?  I am a good guest.  The staff did kindly remove the item off the bill without further discussion.

For dessert, they were out of our first choice (fried dates) so we settled on a scoop of housemade salted caramel gelato.  The gelato was not well presented.  They filled the gelato in a cold sundae cup.  There was not much gelato above the rim of the sundae cup though.  It was flat too--like someone had flattened the top with a spatula.

Despite the presentation, the gelato was actually quite good (and better than the gelato we had at Mario Batali's other and more expensive Vegas restaurant Carnevino).  The gelato was cold and creamy.  The flavor was good.  It was both salty and sweet.  They sprinkled some sea salt on it to give it a more pronounced salty taste.  Despite the salt flavor though, the sweetness of the caramel still came across.

Service was very good.  We were served by a waiter and a waitress. Both servers were dressed casually and they were friendly and funny but also polite and attentive.

After having mostly positive experiences at Mozza, I was hoping that Otto could become a good Vegas spot for tasty food at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, most of the food here was average to below average.  Otto is definitely a Vegas restaurant in how it makes the most of its faux but still nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the food here is too similar to many other Vegas restaurants in how it is not worth the money and lacking in both flavor and quality ingredients.

yZ3Jzeg7i02gk-mwGI3BKw,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,3qlqzQrwh8hjBltlgFgsJQ,2015-01-21,"Ever since I moved downtown, this little corner of 3rd Street and Roosevelt has seemingly been one of those spots where good restaurants go to die.  I'm not sure if its the building, the fact that its set back from the street or the restaurant concepts themselves.  For whatever reason, nothing ever sticks here.  I remember when this location was the popular breakfast and brunch chain known as Scratch.  I remember when this place was The Local, a bold upscale concept that invited curiosity but never caught fire.  Now Paz, a cantina style taqueria has taken hold here.  Will it stick? Difficult to say.  But first impressions are good enough that I hope so.

The menu at Paz is one that largely sticks to a core of Mexican food favorites.  There are a few choices of tacos and tortas and a few other items, but the menu doesn't venture very far from that.  If you're looking for a wider variety, there are plenty of other Mexican establishments to choose from.  But despite the limited choices, the choices I had at my disposal tonight were quite tasty.  Tonight I went for four different tacos.  A pair of traditional tastes in the Carne Asada and Carnitas.  And for a little outside the box variety I went with the Tinga (a slow cooked chipotle chicken taco) and a Fish taco with I believe was fried mahi mahi.  My friend also got two tacos (the Tinga and Carne Asada).  When they came out, the presentation was tremendous with an array of colors from the different meats and toppings incorporated into the tacos.  All were small street style tacos with a soft warm tortilla to match.  By far my favorite was the Carne Asada.  I guess I'm traditional, but its just hard to beat great grilled steak.  The Tinga was also excellent and I especially loved the pickled onions they used to top it.  The Carnitas was also as expected with crispy pork and a chile sauce that had just the right amount of kick.  The fish taco was actually a bit spicier than most fish tacos I've had.  That jalapeño sauce probably had a lot to do with it.

Overall, a delicious taco assortment and just the right size.  I also got one of their ""One Love"" Margaritas with 100% pure agave tequila, strawberries, and Grand Marnier.  Tasty drink, though for $8 I probably would've expected a bigger size.  Which brings me to my one beef with the place.  The prices.  Total price for me and my friend for 6 individual tacos, a margarita, tax and tip came to about $35.  Chips and salsa were included too, but you catch the drift.  Its probably a little expensive for what it is.  The quality was excellent, but I'm not sure it was $35 excellent.  

Still, there's enough to like about this place that I'd certainly make another trip.  And to the credit of the owners, they've hit on a niche in that Roosevelt Row (until now) had virtually no Mexican food offerings to speak of.  Seems like they're still tinkering with the menu and the design of the restaurant, but so far they seem to be garnering a stronger following than this location's predecessors.  We'll see if it has staying power.  Hooray for tacos!",Restaurant

Through out the staff at Blue Hound was attentive and professional, but also gave us our space. We were seated against a window with views of Phoenix skyline and the old court building, On our table was a card congratulating us on our anniversary signed by several people on the staff (one wishing us Happy Birthday - my wife's favorite).

We started with cocktails and at the waiter's suggestion I had a Lawless (Bourbon, homemade bitters and liqueur and served in a glass that was presented upside down over smoldering tobacco smoke). It was sweeter than I expected but very balanced. My wife enjoyed the Romeo & Violette, choosing only based on the name of the drink. Her drink was not as sweet as I expected but similarly balanced.

For dinner we both had the Chef and Bar Geek out for $48.00 each. This was four courses, of which three were served with cocktails and none were on the menu. The manager, mixologist, sous chef, and chef each visited our table several times. They started by asking for preferences and allergies (non) and then explained each cocktail and course. 

The first course did not have a cocktail and was a cod served with olive oil, fennel and other ingredients the four cocktails now have me forgetting. The dish was mild with tangs from the fennel and spices. I remember thinking that I'd never have order this on a menu based on the description (I need to broaden my horizons), but it was amazing!

The second course came out after we were presented with a watermelon flavored and vodka based cocktail served with the foam of egg whites on top. We were guessing what the course might be based on the drink, but didn't come close. The second course was soft shelled crab on a bed of local sweet corn. We had never had soft shelled crab before so the waiter explained that we did not need to remove the shell, but could just enjoy it all. I enjoy crab, so I'm not sure why I've never had soft shelled crab. All together it was delicious again and also something I'd never have considered reading on a menu. 

The third course came out after we were presented with a cocktail based on the house mulled wine topped with egg whites. It was a heavy and spicy drink (and amazing) so we were predicting beef or pork for the next course. The third course was pork belly topped by a poached egg and served on a chorizo aioli with Mexican spiced corn cut off the cob and a Blue Hound tater tot. I  was glad to see the tater tot, having read about Blue Hound's tater tots here, but my wife never would have ordered it. . In fact, it is here where I am relying on pictures and the third cocktail makes it a little fuzzy. Just the same, it was also amazing and we were stuffed at the end (yeah, we could have stopped and not eaten it all, but that was neigh impossible). 

Prior the fourth course we were presented with an espresso-based cold cocktail that had us guessing chocolate. The desert came after we had had time to let the prior three courses settle over conversation; not so soon as to rush us but not so late as to have us looking for the waiter. Desert was the only course where we received different dishes. I was given a pineapple upside down cake under medjool ice cream with salted carmel sauce (this was the only item of the evening that I later saw on the menu). My wife was given some sort of flour-less chocolate cake with a salted carmel sauce and ... well, I forget the rest. The pineapple upside down cake was just so good. She ate half of my desert and we both had far more than we should have. We both liked her desert, but the pineapple upside-down cake with the carmel and ice cream what just right. 

The dinner came in under $200 for the two of us including tip. To be honest, I'd expected it to cost far more and, considering the quantity and quality of food and service we received, the price was a bargain. Blue Hound will definitely have us looking for excuses to come downtown again. I was happy we were staying at the Palomar so the right ""home"" was just an elevator ride. To do even just the three cocktails (ha! even just!) that came with the ""geek out"" experience I would definitely need a taxi or designated driver home. Thankfully the Hotel Palomar has fantastic summer rates and a room was less than the price of a car or taxi.",Restaurant
hRhwuZK2pf51LzPiaPKYOA,GEQ7fuPWSZ3QwJw63wSvqg,LkgbEuPiG3vRtT-s6uSYIg,2008-10-07,"Being a woman isn't really an excuse because I know plenty of men who love to shop. There are people who love clothes shopping... gadget shopping... and grocery shopping. Those of you who fall under the last category ""lovers of grocery shopping"" are a twisted bunch, in my opinion. Especially if you do your grocery shopping at Super Walmart.
If you take offense easily you should press on because the truth is sometimes a little backhanded and what I have to say about the crowds and about walmart is no joyful dissertation.
For centuries bargain shoppers across America have flocked to this overpacked, understaffed bustling treasury of prepackaged processed food and jettison. With ""Rollback Savings"" as the slogan of middle-low class Myspace pages we've certainly given in to the consumer mentality they are banking on. I for one have been and will again shop at Wal mart. But for what it's worth there are a few ""beefs"" (no pun intended) that I have with this place.
The first is the staff at my local supershack. WHY oh WHY are there so many people working in the craft department but never enough working at the deli? At the lowest point in my walmart shopping debacle I have waited TWENTY MINUTES for sliced meat. Simply for the fact that I wanted to see how long it would take for them to slice meat I wasted almost half an hour of my life. I will never get it back. This woman behind the counter dawning a freshly stretched hair net asked me ""What can I get ya?"" and I asked very politely for one half pound of thin sliced turkey. This request would be the death of me. My first mistake was not specifying the brand and genre of turkey I would like. ""Do ya wanna have smoked, hickory smoked, honey baked, roasted, Jeannie-O, Sara Lee, Boar's Head..."" OH. MY. GOSH. So I specified very clearly, ""I would liked Roasted Jeannie-O turkey, sliced thin."" And she looked at me like I'd asked for a deep fried mars bar. I repeated myself, again, making sure to pronunciate my words clearly and it finally seemed to seep in. So she goes over to the meat case and gets out the END CAP of a roasted turkey. Dread setting in to my mind now... She turns to me and says, ""Hun, we're all outta roasted turkey by Jeannie-O can I getcha Sara Lee? But it's not on sale, you'd have to pay the full price."" By now there is a line of angry huffing customers waiting for their super bargain deli meat and I am feeling the pressure. So I say, ""Yes, yes that's fine I'll take whatever you've got."" So she finally gets the meat out of the case after rewrapping her end cap of Jeannie-O and unwraps the Sara Lee and we're finally getting somewhere when she turns around and says, ""Hun, what number do you want me to slice the turkey on?"" All I can do to keep myself from screaming is say, ""As thin as you can get it without actually shaving it."" I can hear the woman behind me shaking her head and drumming her fingers on the cart handle. If the looks could kill I would be six feet under by now.
So finally we're at the slicer and she has unwrapped the meat and all I can imagine now is that this woman is going to turn on the slicer and slice her fingers off and then some angry customer behind me will yell, ""Look what you've done!"" and kill me.
But she gets slicing and seems to be doing well until I realise that she has started to shave the turkey. I decide this isn't a big deal and watch her finish up. I'm dreading the next question but I know it's coming... ""Would you like something else, hun?"" And the question that has been bouncing around in my mind.. Do I really need cheese...? Finally I decide that turkey without cheese is like peanut butter without jelly.. so I say, ""Yes, one half pound of Stella Provolone Cheese."" (I'm prepared with a brand name this time.) And it's like the entire line behind me is groaning and whispering about me. My palms are sweating now. Where are these people? Shouldn't there be more than one deli slicer person here? Are they all at lunch, what's the deal? So she gets my cheese and I'm thinking yes, this only took a few seconds and then she turns around and scratches her face with her gloved hand and I'm thinking.. oh crap. So she says, ""Sorry I need to go get a new glove and the box is empty so I have to go in the back and get a new one."" I'm practically shaking now. There is an angry mob of people behind me who just want a pound of roast beef and I am in the way of them getting it. I'm afraid for my life.
So she comes out with her new glove, all smiles and chipperness and I'm about ready to reach across the counter and...
So she gets the cheese and brings it to the slicer and starts slicing a piece and then she picks the piece up off the counter, turns around and announces, ""IS THIS THIN ENOUGH?"" And all I can do is meekly shake my head that it is..... This won't all fit here so *boo, hiss* shameful plug: www.delectabledlights.blogspot.com    Read more there.",Shopping
PxEvVZTj_PSixvaqhOOwDA,TSxpgqzG0u38CGyyLfSAAg,nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg,2008-06-03,"Old World Italy in Chandler, AZ"" sounds like the set up for a joke.  You wouldn't expect to find one of the best Italian restaurants in metro Phoenix located in downtown Chandler, but that's the case with La Stalla Cucina Rustica. 

The decor clearly conveys the Old World focus of the restaurant.  From the wood tables and chairs to the faux finished walls and the hand painted murals, this place is evocative of rural Italy.  If you've traveled throughout Italy, the atmosphere at La Stalla won't magically transport you back, but you will appreciate the elements that have been gathered together to bring a bit of the old school Italian vibe to downtown Chandler.  After all, that's no small feat. 

The food is traditional and consistently good.  Don't come here for cutting-edge Italian, but for the classics.

For appetizers, the Calamari Fritti ($12) features crispy calamari and a spicy marinara sauce.  I do not order calamari because it's usually not fresh in Arizona, but it's a favorite of my dear friend who lives in Chandler and the La Stalla version is pretty good.  The Pasta e Fagioli soup ($6) is true to the classic and features tender cannellini beans and pasta.  They sometimes feature an appetizer special of stuffed mushrooms that are baked in their brick oven and they are fantastic.

For pasta dishes, the Tortelloni Panna Proscuitto e Piselli ($18) includes tortelloni pasta with ham and peas in a cheese cream sauce.  It's unbelievably rich.  We're talking heart attack on a plate rich, but it's darn tasty.  Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18) is another true-to-form old school dish.  It features spaghetti with smoked pancetta in a parmesan egg cream sauce.  The BF enjoys the Risotto Agli Scampi ($19) that combines baby shrimp and arborio rice.

In the entree category, Involtini di Vitello ($23) is the favorite of my Chandler friend.  It features mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal and pan seared in a sherry sauce.  Personally, I avoid this dish due to the veal.  I'm starting to come around to veal and will try it as soon as I find a restaurant that offers true free range veal.  Be sure to ask about the specials because they are often excellent and even the vegetables served alongside many of the entrees are perfectly seasoned. 

Here's an admonition to La Stalla and other spendy Italian restaurants in Phoenix:  Grated parmesan cheese (even Parmigiano Reggiano) is not a controlled substance.  It's cheese, not crack.  Please do not make a huge deal out of spooning out the tiniest amount for me on top of my soup or pasta.  When I ask for grated cheese, just leave me a small bowl at the table to use at my discretion.  You can trust me to not bring a Ziploc bag to steal what I don't use during my dinner.  If the cost of the cheese is an issue, then tack a dollar or two onto each dish and be done with it because the food cost of the cheese should already be factored into your prices.  The cost of the grated cheese at La Stalla should not be an issue because the price point of the menu has risen noticeably in the past year.

For desserts, the standout is the Fruta di bosco con Zabaione ($9).  It's a mix of seasonal berries topped with Grand Marnier Zabaione sauce.  I always marvel at the perfect, beautiful berries that La Stalla manages to source at all times.  The Zabaione sauce is generously flavored with Grand Marnier and sugar and it's whipped up to a delightfully fluffy texture.  It's flat out fantastic!  The Chocolate ""Souffle"" ($10) is more of a molten chocolate cake than a true chocolate souffle that you would find at Christopher's.  However, it's the favorite of my Chandler friend, so it often gets ordered.

If you're lucky, you will be offered a shot of the housemade Limoncello to finish off your meal.  It's popular and they often run out, but it is the perfect end to a meal at La Stalla.

La Stalla is a bit spendy.  Dinner for two can easily near $100 with appetizers, soups\/salads, pasta dishes or entrees, desserts, drinks, tax and tip. The quality is definitely worth the expense, but this is not your inexpensive neighborhood Italian joint.

nsB4MDEHvPsDQBlrMeWl-Q,Jxag_hw-MWKAGugjDKcpOg,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2017-04-30,"Ms. Mary Giuliano - General Manager - Vdara Hotel
Dear Ms. Giuliano - 
Thank you for inquiring about our stay at Vdara from Wednesday April 20 - Sunday April 23, 2017.  
My wife and I came to Las Vegas for a business conference, and planned to stay a couple of extra days to see some of the sites and take in a show.  We are not gamblers, and prefer to stay away from the smoke-filled casinos and crowds.  When it comes to a grading a hotel we use Hilton or Marriot as a benchmark, and things can either be better (or worse) from there.  
We chose to stay at Vdara because of its reputation as a high-service experience, with a spa, and a place to have a small meal or a drink.  An added bonus, as described on your web site, we liked the fact that the concierge would take care of securing an Avis rental car for us. For this experience, Vdara charged around $300 a night (plus a resort fee), which was more expensive than other places.  However, we felt the experience and convenience would be worth it.  Unfortunately, Vdara failed to meet our expectations.  
Here's what went well -
1] My wife had a massage at the spa.  The facility and attendants were very nice, and the masseuse did a fine job. 
2] The room itself was fine. The bed was comfortable.  The room was clean, quiet, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  Overall, nice modern design. Of note, one the TV's in the room was broken. 
3] The bar at Vice Versa, was fine.  Welcoming staff, drinks were good, laid-back atmosphere.  The Market Café had good salads and sandwiches, and it was convenient.
Here's what did not go well - 
1] Front of the hotel staff. They were non-existent - no valet, nor bellhop - during the entire 4 days we were there.  When it came to checking our bags, hailing a cab, parking our car - we were on our own. To self-park the rental car, we had to go across the way to the Aria.  While we did not find that a big deal, we did find it odd that a high-service hotel of the supposed caliber of Vdara, failed to offer such basic services to its guests.  What was the tipping point?  Having to walk across the Aria's smoke filled casino every time we wanted to get the car.
2] The concierge.  For the last two days we were at Vdara, we inquired with the concierge about renting a car with Avis.  Her answer?  I shall paraphrase, ""...Avis has a counter at the Aria.  They never answer our phone calls. You'll need to go over there yourself to rent the car..."" Our request was by no means extraordinary, and it fact, it is a service that your hotel advertises to provide to its guests.  Any concierge at a Hilton or Marriott would have readily taken care of it.
3] The pool and spa. They were fine...when they were open.  Unfortunately, due to my conference schedule, I was not able to get to the workout facilities between 8am-6pm.  I assumed that the room key-card would allow for access to the gym after hours, which has been my experience at a Hilton or Marriott.  But at Vdara, this is not the case.  Plus, the resort fee is added to the cost of the room.  So, at Vdara I paid a resort fee, for facilities I did not even get to use.  
4] The Vdara website describes a variety of restaurant choices at the Aria across the way.  Indeed, they are good.  But we had to walk through the casinos to get there.  In hind-site, I should have known better.  When staying on the Strip in Vegas, it stands to reason that even in hotels advertised as ""casino-free"", there will be means to get the guests into a casino.  Next time I will know better.
5] On the last day of our stay at Vdara, we were looking for the front staff to help us hail a cab to the airport.  Again, there was no one to be found.  We decided to walk over to Aria, where the bell hop literally saw us walking over from Vdara and came over to help.  He took our bags, hailed the cab, put the bags in the car, was tipped very well, and we were off.   It was a stark contrast from the Vdara experience, just 200 feet away.  I got the impression, that this is not the first time that Aria staff had seen this happen with Vdara guests.
At the end of the day, we paid a premium to stay at Vdara partly to avoid the smoke and crowds of the casinos.  But in reality, between having to go through the Aria's casino to get the car, and access their restaurants, we ended up spending just as much time in a casino while staying at Vdara as we would have had we stayed at Aria or Bellagio.  The key concept I want to convey to you is this... At least at the Aria or Bellagio, you actually get the service (valet, bellhop, concierge) to go along with the price tag...which is something that is significantly lacking a Vdara.  
It is for these reasons, that I cannot recommend your hotel.  I hope this letter assists you to create a better experience for your future guests.",Beauty

Otherwise, shop around. My one-star review is a result of their delivery system and how they treat customers after they screw up. And they screwed up my delivery three straight times. If you choose their delivery for $60 extra (good price if they actually complete it on time) they give you a choice of days for delivery but you will not know the two-hour window of delivery until you receive a robo-call the night before. They say a computer must select the routes for the next day and they can't work out any special arrangements. Their last delivery window ends at 4 p.m. They also say the delivery driver will call you when they are close to your home within the two-hour window. This scheduling process is a little inconvenient and lacking human touch. None-the-less, I thought I would put my faith in technology when I purchased a sofa and a dining table and chairs for a great price since they had been sitting in the store for three months. I thought it was worth reserving a day off to wait on the delivery.But I never got the robo-call the night before. I started calling them but got no answer, just voicemail. I did not get a return call in a timely manner. More calls were made on the scheduled delivery day with the same result. Request for voicemail. I went to the grocery store since I figured I would at least get a call on my cell phone if by chance the robo-call failed but they still planned to deliver. No call. I finally reached a person on the phone later in the day who said the delivery truck was there earlier but I wasn't home.After I told them I never received a call they said their computer showed otherwise. They did make arrangements to deliver later that day since the driver was still in the neighborhood. Happy with my furniture I went back to the store on another day to search for a dresser and  a TV cabinet. I found good prices on furniture that was recently marked down because it had been in the store a long time. Scheduled delivery for the next Saturday. Same errors occurred. No robo-call. Multiple calls to store unanswered. I called their other store on Rainbow. Someone answered their but refused to connect me with the delivery driver and just transferred me to the other store where no one answered. A repeated effort to call the Rainbow store led to a hang-up by their sales person. I finally drove to the Apache store. The warehouse manager met my claims with great skepticism and said their computer shows they tried to reach me and there was nothing they could do but reschedule. I showed them my cell phone log history to let them know I did not get the call. Still no acknowledgement on their part of a mistake. Finally I asked them what number they had for me in their system. They had the wrong number. Someone wrote an incorrect digit. They didn't think to check that the first time or the second time and assumed the customer screwed up. So I finally got an apology and a promise to deliver the furniture at the window I preferred the following Monday (today). I also received a $25 off coupon for a future purchase. This time the robo call worked and I received a call from the driver 30 minutes before the he arrived. But guess what -- they didn't have the right order. A piece was missing. I called the store to explain the situation and asked that I get the missing furniture delivered asap. The sales person said she would look into it and call me back. I was expecting a quick call back.It didn't happen. I called them again within the hour and received a ""we're looking into it"" response. I told them I was looking for a ""I am sorry we screwed up again"" response and we will make this right. They didn't. They said the next available time for delivery was a week away. I asked why was not a priority now that it was clearly their fault. The sales person said she needed to speak with the warehouse manager and he was not available. Moral of the story - avoid their sales people, wait for furniture to go to a final markdown, and do not choose their delivery process. It would have been worth me paying a separate driver $100 to deliver it at a more convenient time. I personally can't go back there to face them since they have taken so much of my valuable time away from me and they are cold.",Shopping
5RZV-fQ4WFkWVCor3a9QIQ,dcpE4CUvtqLf63tRJgNqKQ,C-tt0mrVX_ZrBqXaY964kA,2017-01-01,"Our first experience at this Kay Jewelers was around December 23rd, 2015. We dealt with a somewhat younger man with dark brown hair. My now-husband and I had been talking about marriage and we decided to walk in to see if we could find out my ring size. Well, finding my ring size turned into also finding a ring. I was a 6.5 to 7 and incredibly anxious, as I'd never really tried on jewelry like that before. So, we trusted our sales representative and let him pull rings in my size.We found a great wedding band\/engagement ring set and were out the door. 

We took the rings to the six-month checks without hiccup, but as our wedding drew near and we hammered out details of the ceremony(we weren't sure what to do with the engagement ring during the ceremony and weren't familiar with the usual customs during the ring exchange), I try on the wedding band. I notice that my engagement band is noticeably looser than my wedding band. At first I think it's simply due to shape since the thin wedding band curves to hug the engagement band's stone, but  once I was married and wearing the two rings together, there was no mistaking it...one band seemed bigger than the other. 

I returned to the store and spoke with a woman named, Cheryl. She's as nice as can be and incredibly helpful. I asked her to check the sizes of my rings. My wedding band comes in at a size 7, like it was supposed to...but my engagement band clocked in at 7 3\/4. The rings had been sold to us as a set under the expectation that they were both size 7. I asked if this ring had been owned before, but Cheryl said there would be no way of knowing if it had been and that the ring could have simply been made bigger by mistake. It sounded weird, considering the rings they receive usually come in standard size of 6 1\/2 or 7, and this was a set. How a ring would be made 7 3\/4--so far from their standard sizing-- while the wedding band was a 7 didn't seem right. Either way, we had the rings now and there was no changing it a year later, so I asked if both of my rings could be resized to 6 1\/2. 

Cheryl wrote everything down perfectly, but when I received my rings two weeks later, I found they had been *soldered* together without my permission and without any request to do so on the order\/repair form! I had already been wary of resizing and messing with the rings too much and compromising the integrity of the metal, and I had wanted the option of wearing my wedding band separately in case I had projects to do where I didn't want my engagement stone snagging. In addition to that, the soldering job wasn't even very good. The engagement band and wedding band are misaligned together. 

Cheryl was shocked to see my rings soldered together and printed out my warranty for the repair, assuring me that I could have them separated and\/or realigned in case I wanted to keep them soldered together. I was happy that she was so kind about it, but after already having one ring sold to me out of size and now having them soldered together without permission, I don't feel very comfortable or happy with trusting them again with my rings.

While we were there, we asked if we could also use my husband's warranty to get him a half-size smaller in his ring. We purchased his ring at Kay before noticing the problem in size with mine. Brian had been the one to sell us his ring. He had been sized as an 11 and thought he'd been given a size 11 ring, since Brian handed it to him saying it was a size 11. He had chosen that ring purposely a little looser in case the summer time made his hands swell too much(Tungsten Carbide can't be resized), but after wearing it for a while, it was simply *too* loose. We thought, ""Oh, no big deal. Just go from an 11 to a 10 1\/2"". When Cheryl checked his ring, we found out that his ring was not actually a size 11, but a 12! He now needed a ring 1 1\/2 times smaller than he thought he did.

Cheryl has been wonderful so far and has been accurate and careful with sizing and rings, but we don't know why the two men we worked with before sold us rings out of size, saying they were a size they weren't. It certainly wasn't to save our vanity or something. We weren't trying to squeeze our fingers into impossibly small rings that we couldn't pull off or that we'd swell out of in the summer time. Cheryl again has so far tried to help us resolve that issue. 

Overall, while their service at the location has been friendly for me so far, I would not recommend this Kay Jewelers to do business. I no longer trust the shop they send their jewelry to for inspection and repair, and I don't trust certain sales reps' ability to size a ring properly or be entirely honest. After all, if I go to a shoe store and find out my size was 7, I expect the sales person to give me size 7 shoes. I don't know if they pushed them to make sure we left with something so they could make money. The blunder with my ring repair makes me regret doing business with Kay, since my warranty is tied to them.",Shopping
hwNFd_rZhBzAs4-VXVFTkQ,UpkGzu_AWiLKPOrYxwLf4w,bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA,2017-06-04,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING AND EVERYONE SHOULD GO AND I WISH I WENT BACK AND ORDERED SO MUCH MORE FOOD.  If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  It makes my other 5 star reviews feel ever so slightly undeserved.

First note, this is not Japanese ramen.  It's Chinese hand-pulled noodles (pronounced la-mian) from Lanzhou, a city famous for these particular noodles.  On the menu are also other dishes hailing from Xinjiang province (known for its Muslim community), like lamb skewers, rou jia mo (meat in between two toasted slices of a bun), and sesame pancakes with beef.  The cumin, the meat, and the different pancakes and noodles are just...I can't do the food justice with words.  I have not had food this delicious and satisfying since visiting China.

Ambience & Service:
Clean and simple, it looks more hole in the wall from the outside, but the inside was nicer.  The best part?  Behind the front desk, we could see a chef pulling and splitting the noodles as we ate.  There's nothing quite like a dinner performance to convince you on the freshness and authenticity of what you're eating.  As for service, it was blunt and efficient.  The restaurant was full, but we waited 5 minutes for a table.  To order, we were given a small slip of paper and instructed to write the menu numbers on them.  I loved it.  It was just so efficient.  I also like to imagine that this is the chef's way of saying, ""nothing else here matters except for what you're about to eat"".  Of course, it was probably just because they were busy and wanted to turn over the tables.

Food:
Everything we tried was great, so this is functionally just a list of everything we tried.
-Sliced noodles with braised beef: Imagine a chef slicing off strands from the edges of a large slab of dough into a bowl with a consistent and dangerous precision.  Personally, I find the sliced noodles a lot better than the hand pulled.  It was denser and, because it was sliced, the thickness within a strand of noodle varies.  In the middle, the thickest part, it was denser, doughier, chewier and tasted more purely of the noodle.  To the sides, it was thinner, and therefore mushier, lighter, and had picked up more of the broth.  Eating one strand at a time meant tasting how the noodle and broth complimented each other; eating a spoonful of noodles meant feeling how satisfying it is to snap through the noodles and to let that simple aroma flood your mouth.  The beef was also soft - to be honest, I really only paid attention to the noodles.
-Golden Needle Mushrooms: my favorite appetizer.  These mushrooms were always a favorite of mine (try them in hotpot, or wrap them in aluminum foil with some butter and roast them), but this place did well to highlight its natural sweetness.  It was also made with bell peppers, which was a great idea.  Both bell peppers and these mushrooms have subtle flavors, but since bell peppers are commonly used to lend more flavor to a dish and the mushrooms were so much lighter, the mushrooms here picked up the flavor of the bell peppers extremely well.  The chef also did well to not overcook the mushrooms as they still had snap when chewed.  We should have ordered another one.
-Jellyfish salad: the jellyfish was crunchy and not slimy, a sign that it is fresh and well prepared.  The sauce was also slightly garlicky; it was very light and tasty, a great appetizer.
-Hand-pulled noodles with beef: Perhaps we should have tried a different broth that was a bit more flavorful, but the noodles were just a bit too bland.  Something spicy would have been nice as the noodles would act as breaks in between sips of broth.  Texture-wise, the noodles were chewy.



Recommendations: 
Bring a group of friends or a foodie friend and order everything on the menu.  Next time, I would love to try the sesame pancake with beef, the lamb skewers, and the liang pi (cold noodles - they were out this time).",Restaurant

Such was the case during my first visit to El Chullo. Admittedly I'm a novice when it comes to Peruvian cuisine so it was with some apprehension that I ventured here on a Saturday around Noon.  I had seen the great reviews this place was getting, but honestly had no idea what to order when I got there.  Fortunately my waitress helped guide me through it, and helped me make some delicious choices indeed.

As with so many Mom & Pop ethnic establishments in the Downtown Phoenix vicinity, the restaurant is a small space in an old building.  This space is on the northeast corner of 7th Street & Virginia, in between a barber shop and a convenience store.  There's barely any parking up front (though there were available spots when I arrived).  There is, fortunately, extra parking available in back (take the alleyway east of the convenience store and you'll run into a parking lot leading into El Chullo's back entrance).  The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 including the bar area.  When you walk in you immediately hear the Peruvian dance music in the background.  When I arrived just before Noon I was actually the only customer there, though the lunch crowd started streaming in shortly thereafter.  

A quick FYI that from 10am-Noon on the weekends, they serve breakfast only.  It was close enough to Noon that they allowed me to go with the lunch menu instead, but just be aware of this if you're coming here on the weekend.  I started things off by ordering a traditional Pisco Sour.  Pisco is basically a type of Peruvian Brandy and a Sour is traditionally mixed with lime, syrup, bitters, and egg whites.  Wow, talk about refreshing.  There's enough alcohol to remind you its a cocktail, but truly a smooth, delicious, easy drinking cocktail perfect for any occasion.  For an appetizer I went with the Causa Rellena with crab filling (you can also choose a chicken filling).  Two potato cakes with crab filling and avocado in the middle, topped with a dusting of cilantro, half a hard boiled egg, and what I believe was a liquified sweet potato sauce.  Holy moly was this awesome.  It wasn't huge (maybe 3 inches in diameter & 3 inches tall), but remarkably rich and filling.  I'm not sure what type of potato they used for the potato cakes, but the texture was smoother than any potato I've had (maybe they used extra butter?).  And there was plenty of crab meat in there to be sure.  If you're coming here for the first time, get this.  I'm making it mandatory.

After the appetizer, I had no idea what I was doing, so I let the waitress pick the next two items for me.  For the main entree, she recommended trying one of the ceviches since this was my first time here.  I went with the Ceviche Mixto since that had a variety of seafood (though admittedly I didn't ask which kinds).  The seafood is garnished with onions and a spicy lime juice blend (you can get it super spicy, or go with a mild spice level as I did) and comes with sides of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, and cancha (basically dried corn).  Again, didn't look like a huge portion but they packed in a ton of seafood into this dish. In addition to the fish (which I believe was sea bass) there was lots of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and octopus.  I'm not a huge fan of squid or octopus so I was a little apprehensive when I saw it, but actually this style tasted quite delicious.  All of the seafood tasted fresh and the lime sauce had the perfect amount of seasoning.  There's actually enough food in this dish to be split by two people, which probably explains why I felt pretty full after I finished.  Nevertheless, the waitress prodded me to try one of their desserts, so she had me try the Alfajor.  Two round flaky sugar cookies covered in powdered sugar with dulce de leche filling in the middle and chocolate sauce on the side.  I don't how in the world I had room for this, but I made it happen.  The dulce de leche was buttery smooth and the cookie cut with a fork.  An awesome, decadent conclusion. 

Absolutely incredible meal.  The presentation, the flavors, and the variety was amazing.  They actually have a number of chicken and beef dishes to choose from as well, and I'll be sure to try those upon my next visit.  Total cost for this go around including the drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and tip came to $50.  Worth every penny as El Chullo's cuisine could easily work as a fine dining experience (though I'm thrilled its just a neighborhood joint that I can wear my flip flops to).  I now see why Peruvian cuisine is quickly conquering American pallets, and El Chullo is Phoenix's ground zero.",Restaurant
XzSRVeu-9QYAFrvi3fivLg,ddrgSxl8E0PfcfXYViscQA,Mnt05XMgWKz2_4V_IKXgvw,2013-02-12,"Worst.  Massage.  Ever.

I guess I should clarify that a little.  ""Worst massage experience ever"" is a little more appropriate.  I came to this establishment because I bought a Groupon for a 60-minute massage and optional spray tan.  I was a first time client, which is what these marketing promotions are supposed to attract, right?  Well, rest assured I will never step foot on the premises again.  If you don't want to read the whole review, the take-away keywords are: unprofessional, trashy and appalling.  

This miserable tale begins with me arriving a few minutes early to the strip mall where this place is located.  The office area appears to have a number of people operating various businesses out of one space with one common waiting room.  Fifteen minutes after the massage was supposed to start, Jan Thompson (owner) came out, apologized for running late and said she would be ready in a moment.  

After a few minutes, I entered the massage room that doubles as a spray tan application area.  The room was rather trashy, with products and random things shoved in corners and around the perimeter of the room.  The room was right next to the front door so it wasn't very quiet.  Also, the front of the room consisted of store front windows that were somewhat poorly covered both in style and effect.  The room did nothing to lend itself to a relaxing environment.  Had I been paying full price for this massage I would have probably just turned around then but since it was only $39 I figured I'd just go with it.  ""How bad could it be?"" I foolishly asked myself.  Jan introduced herself, told me that she would be using hot stones during the massage if that was okay and then asked if I had any requests.  I said that I had been to the chiropractor the day before and would like her focus on my lower back and leg muscles.   She said she would be happy to do that and said she would be checking in with me throughout the massage to make sure the pressure was okay.  I said that would be great because I tend to prefer more of a deep tissue massage to which she responded ""I have strong hands so I'll make sure to check to make sure it's not too much."" 

The massage began with Jan attempting to strike up some conversation.  Personally, I don't care to talk during a massage with someone I'm not familiar with but, whatever.  She asked which chiropractor I was seeing.  A seemingly innocuous question, right?  I told her my chiropractor's name to which she responded, ""Oh, I don't like her.  She soaked my mom dry.  She had her on all this stuff, some sort of powder, and none of it helped her...""  Now, I'm all for sharing personal experiences and reviews (obviously) but I didn't care to hear Jan trash talk my chiropractor and personal friend DURING MY MASSAGE.  I find it incredibly unprofessional for someone to make such comments to a total stranger, especially in this setting.  I responded with a vague, placating comment and tried to just shrug it off in hopes of salvaging this massage.  Unfortunately, there was no salvaging to be had.

The massage continued adequately with the use of hot stones and some stretching.  Suddenly, I hear some beeps behind me and a whirring sound.  Jan said she was warming up a neck pillow for me to help relax my muscles.  I think this was the first time I've experienced a microwave being used during a massage-but this massage was pretty atypical from the start so I just rolled with it.  And then I began to hear a vibrating noise.  At first I thought I accidentally turned my phone on vibrate instead of silent until I realized it was coming from a table closer to my head.  It was Jan's phone, and it kept vibrating.  There were probably five phone calls worth before she stopped the massage, told me she had a flat tire and needed to check her messages to make sure the towing company wasn't outside.  In shock, I said ""okay"".  She proceeded to listen to all of her messages, apologized and then continued the massage.  After several minutes, the vibrating began again and after a few more calls she again stopped the massage.  She again apologized and said the towing company was outside and she needed to step away for a few minutes.  I just laid there, in awe of how ridiculous this experience had been so far, and just said ""okay"".

After about five minutes Jan came back, apologized again and said that I could come back sometime and she would give me a free 30 minute massage to make up for the interruptions.  The massage had lasted 45 minutes at this point and I was still lying on my back.  My one request was to have my lower back and leg muscles focused on and we hadn't even gotten to that yet.  The remainder of the massage consisted mostly of the use of hot stones and her elbow.  The ""strong hands"" that Jan mentioned during the opening act of this farce didn't make much of an appearance at all.

I could go on with some of the other comedic details but I ran out of space.  Keep your free 30 minutes, I won't be back.",Beauty
t32JfiMrFTzxHGECnSFpww,r4tzrWpJei9KCFFukAjMow,LNBL6LI9zKqUbUexwM0L3w,2011-06-24,"I'm going to give them all out 5 stars because Derek and his team at the Bike Joint fixed up my CL special red early-80s Bianchi to more than road-worthy in Toronto's streetcar-track laden battlefield of cars and potholes. From looking into reviews from blogTO, these guys are just an awesome place to get your bike fixed if youre in the area, and I highly recommend them. But here's my experience:

I moved in to the downtown core a couple of months ago, and as a longtime Scarborough resident I relied mostly on my car which I no longer have due to a serious car accident. A bike was my only form of transportation at this point, and I got a fairly good Bianchi as my road bike while I move about the core, and of course bikes are EVERYWHERE in this city so there is a healthy selection of shops for the commuter of every kind of bike they use. 

One night, I rode my bike along and suffered a punctured tire, AND I fell as my thin tires caught the streetcar tires. I thought, well no problem, the next day I went to the nearest bike shop which will remain unnamed and had a rear tire replaced for around $40. My knowledgeable cyclist friend told me it may be the entire tire or the tube, but I had no time so I had it all replaced anyway. That's when the faults of a beater Bianchi started to reveal themselves. The derailleur fell off, fortunately not while I was biking, and going back to their shop they told me the derailleur hanger is stripped, and the only choice I've got is to convert to single speed. $50 poorer and I was back on the street.

Then while biking along Elm St., my rear wheel seized, and found out my rear axle was bent. Went to that shop and they told me I would have to replace the entire wheel; I figured my bike is such a beater it needed a thorough run down, so I also opted for the $40 tuneup in addition to the replacement of rear brake pads as was recommended by the friendly staff. Now, the whole estimate was around $180, and that shocked me, because I talked once again to my good bike mechanic friend (and mind you I do not have the tools or time and my bike mechanic friend lives in Milton) that the axle and bearings if damaged can be replaced, but I was given the idea that the entire wheel should be replaced for safety reasons. 

At the same time I feel that after bringing my bike to that shop after a rear tire, I think I should have been told of the problems with the rear wheel and derailleur as they would have removed the wheel and tire and looked to see if there is something funny and concerning that the bike should not be on the road; they could've recommended me to a. your rear axle is bent as we replaced the tire and saw something funny with your wheel (and given me the necessary advice) and b. your derailleur is stripped you shouldn't ride this bike at all blah blah blah. I feel that especially when I saw the estimate (and the appointment being three weeks away) that I needed a second opinion. At least they put my rear wheel back so its quasi-rideable.

So I e-mailed Derek Chadbourne (the owner) about my situation and offered to look into my bike. I biked to The Bike Joint with my limping Bianchi and was offered an estimate of $80, which I found very reasonable. He was also very friendly and he gave me a vibe that I was very comfortable with; he was obviously busy but he was very accomodating and the experience was a contrast from the other shop closer to downtown. He also offered to fix my bike within a week. Though my busy life afforded me picking up the bike four days after it was done at the specified date, the one thing that amazed me was I ended up paying a reasonable fee (almost the same as the tune up service they offer). 

I am extremely happy with them at this point and I will go back to them again for my bike tune ups and what nots. I feel that they are really taking care of the cycling community in the city who needs to have their bikes on the road, regardless of whether its a beater bike or a lightweight superleggera tourer :D Riding my bike back home was an absolute blast. They ended up fixing my rear axle, put the chain in a gear that I liked (the other shop put the chain in a much lower gear that made my Bianchi too easy to ride around), tuned up everything, and saved me a ton of cash. 

I really really appreciate the courteous service. After riding my bike around, I feel they have really provided competent, quality work. I was afraid my bike would not hold up for a kilometre or two at first because of my past experience with the other shop, but when I got my bike back the courteous service was phenomenal. Even Derek noticed that the front tire needed air while he was with customers. From my experience in customer service, that is exceptional work to really look after your customers. I will be finding myself at their shop once again when my Bianchi needs it because they really helped me out.",Shopping
qqTiK27jAM9GRVkd68s_Tw,y2_-wOBaF8Gi1Ql6MRoCnQ,mvM_bCqtOhtNTQvaRRu0tw,2016-07-03,"So where do I start.  My wife and I are currently sitting down and writing this review together
PROS: 
1) The ceremony ITSELF was great.  It was nice and short, the unity candle was a nice touch, and the chapel was nice and cool, and well decorated
2) They offer live streaming on the internet for those family and friends who cant attend the wedding
3) Gave us a better deal on our picture package, ill get into that later

CONS: 
1) My wife and I opted for the $499 package.  We thought twice, went in and talked to the wedding planner and said we want to downgrade to the $299 package.  We're not looking for anything fancy, but it boiled down to HOW MANY GUESTS were going to be in attendance.  We had roughly 30 guests show up.  If you have any MORE than 20 guests, you HAVE TO get the $499 package.  Fine, whatever, we paid.  What they DONT tell you, is they add 19% to EVERYTHING...EVERYTHING.  So what you thought was $499, really turns out to be closer to $600

2) Day of the wedding comes, according to my wife and her maid of honor, the limo driver sucked.  He had zero etiquette, and apparently told my wife on the phone when he was picking them up at the hotel, ""If you aren't down here in 5 minutes, im leaving you guys.""  Mind you, their scheduled pick up was at 11:15am.  It was 11:05 when he called.  They weren't late, it was an empty threat made for absolutely NO REASON.  

On the ride to the chapel, they hit a yellow light.  Instead of cruising through the intersection, he slammed on the brakes.  Everyone in the back slid to the front of the limo.  Not very fun if you spent all morning getting ready for the big day.  Needless to say she was pissed off.  Oh, and you have to tip the driver $20-40 TO AND FROM your hotel, should you choose to go with the limo.

3) At the chapel,The coordinator upstairs was rude from the get go.  She came in to the chapel after our guests were seated, and in the rudest tone possible proceeded to inform the guests about their no photography\/camera policy.  At all, and that she ""didn't want to have to come back in here and remind everyone of it.""  Talking to a room full of adults like we're children. 

In the bridal room, same lady informed my wife that our daughter, god daughter and maid of honor MUST leave the room.  My wife kindly asked if our daughter could stay.  Her reply was this ""remember what we talked about earlier...you need to be alone in here before the ceremony...remember we talked about that? remember?"" 

This lady was downright condescending.  Not only to our guests, but more importantly to my wife.  The woman who was getting married.  The one who this day was all about.  If you plan on getting married here and see a short, younger, Hispanic woman with dark hair upstairs on the day of. Steer clear and be warned.  You WILL want to yell at her.

4) The Monday following our wedding, we were scheduled to review our wedding pictures.  Something to note, we purchased the package that included 15 pictures.  Sweet.  We knew we only wanted the group photos.  We walk in, watch a slide show they put together.  Awesome. Now heres the kicker.  The 15 pictures that were ""included"", did not count for the group\/posed photos.  The 15 only included the pictures of the ceremony itself.  THIS WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO US AT ANY TIME BEFOREHAND.  Why were we pissed?  The picture packages and pricing were ridiculous.  $800 to purchase all of the pictures and copyrights.  $500 for a CD and 10 posed photos. But wait, you only want a few pictures?  Ok, well that's going to cost you $50 per picture.  

But wait, yet again.  Remember that 19% they added to the cost of our package?  Yeah, that applies here too. So youre looking at closer to $60 an image should you choose to go that route.  So, at the end of the day, you cant take pictures, your guests cant take pictures, and if you choose NOT to buy any of their packages or photos, well guess what? You get zero memories of your big day!

5) I received an email from the Wedding Coordinator Manager regarding our initial complaint about the employee upstairs.  She sent me an email, I gave her a call not even 10 minutes after receiving it and no answer.  I left a voicemail, its been almost a week with no reply from her.

Heres my final thoughts. We paid $499 for our package, $20-40 for limo service EACH WAY, $40-60 for the pastor, NO PICTURES can be taken by you or your guests in or out of the building, ridiculous priced photo packages, and 19% added to everything they want to get you for.  Now, we want you all to understand something.  We're not cheapskates, or complainers, or tight asses with our money.  But if you run a business, and advertise a price and service.  That better be delivered.  It shouldn't be brought up AFTER the fact that theres all of this hidden info.  And yes we a

I've only been to one other place for my own service, but I have accompanied siblings and friends on their waxing trips multiple times, so I sort of knew what to expect. 

From the start, this place looked much different. Normally I try to avoid places so small and so hard to find because I assume if they aren't big enough to have their own building or a better location, they probably are just a cheap or very new little business. Either way, I prefer getting treatments (hair, nails, tanning, etc.) done in more professional, well known places. The waiting room is probably a little larger than the size of the bathroom I shared with my 3 sisters growing up. Enough space to walk and take care of your business, but not enough space for multiple people at once! The decor was alright very cheap looking and cheesy, but the blonde lady at the front desk with the Australian accent was very difficult to understand, ESPECIALLY over the phone. I felt bad having to ask her to repeat herself, but it was very hard to make an appointment. 

My appointment time was for 3:35, I arrived promptly at 3:25 to check in and patiently wait for my waxer to be ready for me. I regretted coming so early as I ended up waiting and waiting until 3:55 to finally be taken back. Personally knowing my wax specialist, I asked why such the long wait. She told me the receptionist never even told her I was there for my appointment until 3:50. She told me she was given a walk-in client at 3:32, which I considered very unprofessional considering I had already been sitting there 7 minutes prior to this lady, who literally WALKED IN and was taken back immediately. So that was the first thing that got me annoyed. 

Next, I was finally back in the room with my specialist and she was nicely explaining all the products and procedures to me as she knew it was my first time being waxed here. I really appreciated that part and how gentle she was. Ultimately I had a good first time WAX experience, but everything else was going down hill. When she finished, I realized I was having some weird allergic reaction to this wax. It was different than the wax I've seen\/had used at other places, and my skin looked like I had painful blustery sunburn by time I paid and drove home (7 minutes away). I talked to the receptionist and another waxer while paying about my face and legs and how painful it was. They told me it wasn't normal and they've never seen it happen and didn't know what to tell me. Needless to say I looked GREAT for the wedding that was the following day. I couldn't really use any makeup to cover for my face, but I did end up finding a last minute long dress to cover my legs. So I guess I only looked half as bad as I could've. It was such a mess, nothing against my wax specialist because she was great. I've never had any other kind of reaction to anything, I don't have sensitive skin or anything, and I still have no idea why this happened to my skin but it was painful and miserable. My specialist tried to talk to the manager into giving me a free service because of how much pain I was so clearly in, but she refused and didn't even feel bad for me at all or apologize. Very unprofessional. Never going back to this place, but I did tell my specialist to let me know if she ever ends up working somewhere else.",Beauty

I love the atmosphere, the knick knacks, and the grocery section. I love the windows and open garage doors and patio area. I love their concept. But unfortunately, I haven't loved the food. I am vegetarian,  not vegan, but still pretty strict and my guy is a meat eating, Nebraska man. The there are plenty of choices to satisfy everyone's needs. Vegan, vegetarian, gluten free,  local...but they are hit or miss. On our first visit I ordered a Naughty nurse, and my bf ordered a non memorable sandwich.  We both got potato salad for our sides. And an iced latte. My sandwich was good, I'd eat it again, and I enjoyed the potato salad. .it was light and dill-y,  but slightly bland. My guy's sandwich was ok, but nothing he remembered as being yum. He didn't care for the potato salad at all. The coffee was good and pretty good sized..no complaints there. Today's visit..not so great. I ordered the fresh kale salad..which they should rename ""the dentist special"". The description says kale, tomatoes, almonds, parmesean,  lightly dressed in lemon and olive oil.  The plate looked gorgeous. .so pretty and bright and fresh..the first few bites were nice...and then it started...this salad must have had 2 cups of roughly chopped almonds in it. Every bite was mouthfuls of almonds..i started to dig around. .more almonds..after getting about a quarter of the way through the salad I had to stop eating.  My tooth was zinging from a particularly hard almond and my jaw, was tired from chewing.  I started to dig out the almonds and separating them. ..i had at least a cup and a half of almonds on my plate. My boyfriend tried the salad and said it tasted like ""cardboard easter basket shreds"". Let's move on to his meal..the ""famous natural burger"". It comes on a brioche bun, with tomatoes and a pickle spear on the side, topped with bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms and cheddar cheese.  He ordered it medium rare with a side of fruit (For me). The burger was well done, but still juicy. But a strange thing happened. .it was dry. Like oddly, dry. He squeezed the meat and you could see juice,  but it was like the bun soaked it up and absorbed it. It came without any sauce, so he added mustard, quite a bit, and it was still so dry. The fruit side was pineapple, cantaloupe and honey dew. It was all hacked up and odd, like a child prepared it. But it was fresh, and after the Easter grass nut salad and dry burger, it was refreshing.  The atmosphere is great..like the perfect, busy coffee house cafe. There are students, business people, ladies who lunch, couples, kids, hipsters, hippies, and the occasional metal head couple (us). The staff is great. Always super friendly. They have a large selection of groceries and to-go food. And a wide variety of coffee and tea drinks. Plus all kinds of cool crap for sale..kitschy lip gloss, ""vintage-y"" kids toys, more stuff than I can even remember.  I just wish the food was more reliable.

Our chef Jerry was fantastic, the show was awesome while our food gets cooked. We were definitely entertained. 

Food
Since we came for Winterlicious, we had limited choices as to what to order. I ordered a White Tuna Seaweed Salad, Scallops (extra) with Sirloin Steak and Mango Mosse Dome for dessert.

White Tuna Seaweed Salad:
I must say I am really really disappointed. It was merely 3 pieces of white tuna sashimi with a handful of pre-packaged seaweed salad. Nothing is made fresh. I have a picky taste for my sashimi, and I can easily tell the fish is no where near fresh. It's AYCE sushi quality at best. The wasabi they have used is not freshly grind either, it feels like a watered down paste. The fish is soggy and watery. I did not like it at all.

Scallops & Steak:
One word: Overcooked. 
My scallops were cooked first. They were decent sized but it was way too overcooked for my liking. It is not tender and the only thing that made them tasty is the slab of butter they add at the end. 
I ordered my steak to be medium rare because I wanted to see the show. It is over cooked for my taste because I like my steak rare, but that might be a personal thing, so I am should not judge on that...But the taste of the actual steak is quite bland, and they strongly encourage you to use the sauce they have provided to eat along with the food. Why? Because it's just...so bland. The portion size is quite good, but the steak itself? Meh. I've had better teppanyaki had AYCE sushi places (*gasp* I know)

Mango Mosse Dome:
By far my favourite part of dinner. The Mosse is nice and light, and it is super pretty! No complaints there. My absolute favourite part.

Complementary food:
Forgot to mention, the dinner came with a complementary soup, salad and rice. Oh and a green tea with dinner. The soup was way too salty, the salad dressing had a really strong taste (almost bitter) and the rice was nicely cooked. It actually gave me an AYCE sushi feel.


Service:
Fast. Streamlined. Everyone had a segregation of duty. They know exactly what they need to do. Almost too well...so well that no one realized my water was empty until half way through the dinner. They refilled it once and never again. Even though there are quite a few servers running around, none of them pay attention to the tables that are already seated. We had to track them down if we wanted anything. And, I didn't like the fact that couple minutes after we finished our dinner, our bill came. We were planning to stay maybe a few minutes more and maybe get a second dessert, but guess not. 

Overall Impression:
If it wasn't for the dessert, they probably will score a 0\/5 in the food category. If it wasn't for the awesome chef, they will score a 2\/5 on the service at most. The food was no where near the price it's worth, the service was rather pushy, with a mandatory 15% tip was added as well...even though it's not a lot, and as terrible as it sounds, it discouraged me from tipping more for the chef for the show. 

If you have never seen live Teppanyaki, go see it for the experience. Our chef was quite the entertainer and made our table's night. But if you expect nicely cooked quality food, please go somewhere else 'cause you ain't finding any here.",Restaurant

After reading my review he contacted me to attempt to resolve my complaints, personally.  He was legitimately appalled by my experience and offered to go above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of.  He obviously cares about his business but has employees that need to care.  I'm sure he is addressing this. My business was concluded with Daltile so I did not take advantage of his offer. I am glad that I let him know about the issues at his business. This may have been taking a toll on his profits and he may have been wondering why.





Zero stars if I could have. Avoid this place!!!!!!  Dodged a big bullet today.  I went there to buy 5 slabs of granite for my new house that I'm building.  When I arrived I had to seek out someone to help me by going back into one if the offices.  Despite the fact that I had a list of the Slabs that I needed from my design center, they handed me a piece of paper and sent me into the warehouse.  This was after a lengthy search for a clipboard which they never found.  I wandered down each aisle searching for my granite, which I never located.  I was told that a guy by the name if ""Manny"" would meet me in the warehouse.  He never showed.  I went back to the office to tell them that I could not find my granite and that Manny never met me.  She said ""I'll try to page him"".  After another lengthy wait.....nothing.  I went back to the office and handed the lady the paper she had given me and I told her I was going to Daltile.  She said nothing.....no apology, just reached her hand out for the paper.  She could care less.  I'm sure 5 slabs of granite won't make or break their year, but this type of customer service will ruin a business.  But, it's not her business so she doesn't care.  Sad.  I called back after I left and asked to speak to a manager. I was told her name was Dawn Bar but she was not available.....imagine that!  I later did a web search of Marble Express and found horrible reviews which I will copy and paste below.  My wife and I were talking to each other about our experience at Marble Express when we arrived at  Daltile. A contractor overheard us and laughed.  He said that one of his clients was telling him a similar story about Marble Express just 2 hours earlier. I now feel very lucky.  I've used Daltile for my previous home and am using them again.  Their operation is a class act. Here are the other reviews I found by doing a web search on Marble Express:

These guys are thieves! We ordered and paid for 4 Full slabs of quartzite. When my fabricator received the slabs, two were missing approximately 25% due to breakage (entire corner missing). Shlomo and Leor (father and son) refused to return calls to rectify the situation. We eventually drove (3 hours round trip) back to Marble express because Leor would not call us back. Receptionist told him we were there, we walked out to the warehouse and he was with customers, so we went back to the lobby to wait. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we found out that he left out the back door. Shlomo told us that we got such a great price that we should be happy with what we got. We were charged by the square foot and shorted over $700 of product. When I told him I would take him to small claims court, he told me that it was my word against his! These guys are lowlifes! I'm taking them to small claims court...

They are extremely shady and it doesn't matter who they hurt. They sold our granite out from under us. Putting a hold on something and signing things doesn't mean anything here. Don't trust anyone here, especially Manny.

For major appliances, it's MEASURE, MEASURE, MEASURE 
For appliance payment, it's Giant Eagle GIFT CARD, 
   GIFT CARD, GIFT CARD

      Don't overlook those barely noticable parts 
       when measuring for a new BIG appliance.

If you're in the market for a larger appliance, I'm going to give some sound advice---less than one-eighth of an inch worth---but one that may save you money, time, aggravation, inconvenience, unpleasant surprises, mangled woodwork, and maybe even an electrical fire (if you weaken and make a last minute decision to become an amateur electrician).

Bought a very nicely-appointed, well sale-priced refrigerator from Sears Outlet.  EDDIE was my exceedingly helpful, knowlegeable, and friendly salesperson.  (MARA---as of May 8, is in training, but has had previous sales experience, so I can recommend her, too.)
                    
Must-Do-But-Not-So-Much-Fun Steps . . . 

1.  Using a tape measure, get precise dimensions 
     in your home.  Measure widths and heights of any 
     door or open area---that might be of questionably
     adequate size---that the new appliance must  pass 
     through.  (Also with doors removed---if it happens 
     that this might be a necessity.  No...you don't have 
     to remove them to do this.)

2.  Look for any possible delivery-day obstacle course, 
     such as furniture or lower hanging lighting that might 
     need to be removed or temporarily held back when 
     appliance is delivered.

3.  Measure the appliance you are replacing PLUS the 
     space that your new appliance will fit into: heights, 
     widths, and depths.

4.  Make a sketch of above with all these measurements. 
     (List is ok, but a rough sketch with accurate measure-
     ments is better.) 

5.  Verify which stores offer gift cards at Giant Eagle. 
     Don't purchase any until you've found the appliance 
     you want.  (Gift Cards cannot be returned.)   Now
     you're ready to go shopping!

6.  Using a tape measure, get all extreme dimensions of 
     each new appliance you're interested in while refer-
     ring to your sketch or list.  And don't forget that back 
     panel---it might be flat\/flush with the frame or be 2-3"" 
     deep.  Some may have something that's barely notice-
     able, such as a few seemingly innocuous half inch 
     clips that tubing runs through.  In a tight fit that can still 
     do damage---to the unit itself, and your home.   By 
     measuring exactly, you'll be able to either quickly 
     eliminate or seriously consider.  (Verify with sales-
     person, but most hinged parts (like doors and freezer
     tops) are removed---or can be---before delivery, so can
     be excluded when measuring.)  Because some stores' 
     delivery charges ($80-150+) are non-refundable, 
     accurate measuring is important.

FUN Steps . . . 

7.  Make your choice.  Ask them to hold that order for 
     payment until you get Giant Eagle gift cards to 
     purchase.  (They carry Sears.  Check for others)  Make
     the purchase. 
 
8.  Fill up your gas tank at ""Get Go"" for less than 50 cents 
     per gallon!  (Savings amount will depend---of course
     ---on your accumulated discount and ""cents-off- gas"" 
     specials they're offering at the time.)


It was at #6 where I could have ended up having a major headache, if not for
waking up the day after I ordered a refrigerator (not here---from a different store) and thought I'd better re-check dimensions on that new one.

Sure enough, I found a small 8"" x 10"" back plate near the bottom of the back panel that I had overlooked because it was low and shallow.  It added nearly 1\/2 inch more.  That meant I'd have about a single hairs width on each side of a door that fridge had to fit through.  I asked if that plate could be removed before delivery, since that would solve the already fairly tight-squeeze problem.  No.  Because it was covering all the electrical stuff, only an electrician could safely remove\/replace---none of their delivery staff could because of liability.  I'm game to try just about anything, but will never play around with electricity---it could leave a mark, leave me fried, or leave me dead.  Reluctantly, I cancelled this order.

Had I not had the presence of mind to more closely re-examine that back panel for something I might have missed, I could have ended up with another $300-400 less credit on my card, for the non-refundable delivery charge, and to pay for repairing\/replacing scratched and gouged-out woodwork.

Happy Ending.   I found a GREAT new fridge here at Sears Outlet---plus 2 fine, good-humored employees.

OtQcgIukwEJ4aFz9tdG9fg,k3zBiXtd0rv8n74VYNdUZw,27_N5P9HZ86IviONPT_twg,2011-05-24,"The hype has made it difficult to not be slightly disappointed, so my advice when dining at Woodlot is to lower your expectations (or just not pay attention to the hype) and then be pleasantly surprised.

Our table was upstairs in the dining room, which others have described as unpretentious but which I found stuffy and uncomfortable. It looked a lot like an Italian restaurant that was trying for ""minimalist"" but missed the mark. In fact, much of Woodlot's decor and food seems to have overshot on what it means to be ""rustic"" and ""unpretentious"" - both the space and the food occasionally go too far, and become just sort of spartan and joyless.

I felt jealous of the people downstairs when I'd head to the bathroom. Sitting at the long, shared baker's table near the kitchen or sitting at the bar may not sound romantic, but it looked more fun and friendly than the staid dining room, which made me feel like I was on an awkward first date.

I love the fact that Woodlot has a solid, standalone vegetarian menu. The service was also very attentive and friendly, and our food arrived quickly. The food was good - and some bits of it were very good - but it certainly wasn't perfect, delicious, or even particularly memorable.

The French onion soup was fine. It did what a French onion soup was supposed to do. My duck and pork belly was certainly ""rustic"", by which I mean ""kind of ugly and mysteriously greyish."" I understand that Woodlot is trying to get away from all the rectangular plates, sugar-dusting, squiggles of sauce, and foam reductions that have turned so much of modern dining into a misery, but simplicity demands perfection - or at least slightly more effort than was evinced by my experience. My duck was bland, and the (nicely seasoned) beans - on which the duck and pork belly were served - were overcooked. The pork belly was delicious and perfectly cooked, but the tiny, stingy portion of it was stupid. It floated around on this huge sea of beans and was dwarfed by the duck leg - half the size of a credit card.

My friend ordered the trout, which was tasteless, watery, and served on a plate of vegetables that also tasted pretty much of nothing. We ordered a side of gnocchi that would've been lovely had their delicate seasoning not been spoiled by greasiness. They were also just kind of thrown into a bowl, and looked limp and soggy.

We were pretty full and opted to split a dessert. The lemon tart topped with blueberry and marshmallow tasted excellent, although we had to hack through the crust like woodsmen (so rustic). The lemon tart arrived, lonely and naked, sliding around on a white plate. Again, I get the whole ""rustic simplicity"" schtick, but it loses its charm when the food you're eating looks like the leftovers you'd eat at home. This style of ""comfort food, done expertly"" is meant to make you feel warm and cosy while reconsidering old classics, but either Woodlot hasn't quite got its ethos together yet, or we happened to be there on a particularly mediocre menu night.

Overall, Woodlot isn't bad, but it couldn't live up to the hype for me. I had a choice between Woodlot and Splendido that particular night, and now wish I'd gone with Splendido.

I wouldn't make reservations again, although I'd tag along if someone else did and they needed a dinner date. I wouldn't mind giving some of Woodlot's other menu offerings a try, but, given that there are so many other restaurants to choose from, I doubt that I'll have the time or the proclivity to return.",Restaurant
lNXkh9GSH7yUDrrs0soeiQ,8twzupHtIu7kWKA6_Vyeog,eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw,2012-01-31,"This was the last place that I ate at in Las Vegas before my flight home. After a weekend of endless walking, buffets, and sight-seeing, I was ready to end my Vegas trip with a simple, light lunch. Even though this place was probably one of the cheapest places that I ate at in Vegas, the experience wasn't worth this price.

We arrived at Serendipity 3 around noon and it was packed outside and inside. Choosing to sit inside, we got immediate seating. However, no server came to us at all for the first 15 minutes. Needing to catch a flight within 2 hours, I flagged down any random waitress nearby to take down our orders. She was incredibly polite and apologetic for our long wait (it took 30 minutes for our food to come out). I appreciated that she made a great effort to make sure we were satisfied with our experience. My boyfriend and I had a coupon that allowed us to get a free frozen hot chocolate as long as we ordered an entree. He ordered an ""A.B.C."" burger (avocado, brie, and caramelized onions) with steak as the meat (the other option is chicken) and his choice of steak fries for the side; I ordered a mac and cheese. Our total came out to be roughly $33 (without tip), which is unfortunately as cheap as it's going to get for a simple meal in Vegas (unless you choose something from Chinatown or McDonalds).

A.B.C. Burger + Steak Fries
I normally would never touch steak or any other beef item, but wow this burger was delicious. I had a nibble of my boyfriend's medium rare steak topped with melted brie and fresh avocado and loved the combination of A, B, & C in this burger. However, I'd say the BEST thing I ate for this lunch was the steak fries. They were meaty yet crunchy and salty but not thirst-inducing. I don't even know how to describe how wonderful the steak fries were. My boyfriend describes these fries as the best he ever had (next to the fries that he ate on one of his Celebrity cruise line cruises, which tasted incredibly similar). 

Mac & Cheese
I don't know how or why Las Vegas activated my cheese addiction, but I couldn't resist ordering this simple comfort-food staple. The macaroni used for this dish was perfect: large tender shells that held the fluid, creamy cheese and slightly crusted on top. The metal pot that the mac and cheese was served in looked small, but, to my own surprise, this was the first time I didn't finish a cheese dish! I wish i had though (just writing about it right now is making my mouth water)! 

Frozen Hot Chocolate
I was somewhat amused by the oxymoron in the name when I first heard about Serendipity's famous trademarked dessert. Contrary to its name, this dessert isn't actually frozen. But it truly is somewhat of a contradiction. It's frozen enough to be eaten with a spoon but melted enough to be drunk with a straw; it's cold enough to enjoy as a dessert but warm enough to enjoy as a sweet, creamy smoothie. My boyfriend claimed this dessert for himself, and even though it couldn't beat out the steak fries for best part of our meal, it came incredibly close. It's definitely a must-try if you're anywhere near Caesar's Palace and crave a unique dessert!",Restaurant

To quote another review, ""WORST SERVICE EVER."" I accompanied my friend, N to this store along with another friend\/bridesmaid while she tried on bridal gowns. As a bridesmaid in her upcoming wedding and someone who is helping her talk out details about her wedding, I know a lot about her ideal style and what she was looking for while trying on dresses. 

Our trio should have known it was going to be a rough ride when we saw the unorganized chaos of the dress racks and how the consultants didn't seem to know who they were helping or which dresses belonged to which person. N's assigned consultant helped her try on her first dress, which fit awkwardly due to a easily fixed mis-sized under garment, but then he immediately left to ""go to the bathroom."" Our bride was left standing there for a handful of minutes while we watched the consultant shoot the breeze with some coworkers after he came back from his bathroom break. Every time N was ready to try on a new dress, she had to wait for several minutes for him to remember what he was supposed to be doing. 

As N was standing in one of the dresses, her consultant came over and, without asking, put a long, flowing white veil on her head. I tried to stop him, saying, ""She doesn't want a veil."" And he promptly replied, ""Maybe YOU don't want a veil, but this isn't about you, it's about her."" ! Here's the thing--my friend is 100% sure she does not want a long veil, but rather a birdcage\/lace veil in front. I wasn't talking about myself in the least. He said, ""I needed to give her the full effect."" What part of ""She doesn't want a veil"" did he not understand?! The bride spoke up after me in agreement and the consultant took the long veil off her, but rolled his eyes at me as he was doing so! At another point he was taking so long to retrieve the next dress off the rack that the other person with us grabbed it and held it up to signal that we were ready to move on. Then the dirty looks really began.

At one point N asked the consultant if he could bring over a short-sleeved lace shrug sort of thing so she could put it on top of another dress to get a visual of what that might look like. He brought a long sleeved shrug that was much too big and said that was the only garment the store had; no other shrugs at all. I replied that I had seen a short sleeved one in the front of the store. He disagreed. So, when he walked away, I grabbed it from the mannequin. As the other bridesmaid and I were walking back with it, we got stopped by the store manager, who reprimanded us like an elementary school principal, for taking it off the mannequin. Fair enough--I had also found about a dozen short-sleeved lace shrugs near where we had stopped. 

Our consultant heard our discussion with the manager and came over. We pointed out the shrugs that he claimed the store didn't have, and he retorted, ""(the bride) told me she wants heavy beading, and these don't have any beading, so I didn't think she would like them."" Ummmm...our friend actually dislikes heavy beading and avoids it. She later confirmed she didn't say that. Either the consultant made that up in front of the manager or had this bride confused with another. Anyhow, the manager caught the tension that was between us and the consultant and asked why we were taking things off the manequins, etc. 

That's when the blow-up started. The other bridesmaid assertively said something like, ""If the service was better, we wouldn't have to try to help her ourselves. We have been waiting most of the time we've been here (etc)"" I added that the consultant claimed the store didn't have any shrugs and there were actually quite a few, with evidence next to us. We were both simply stating that we weren't feeling valued as customers. The manager didn't apologize, but instead got extremely defensive, telling us that if we wanted better service we should come M-F during the day, when it is ""completely dead"" as opposed to a busy Saturday. 

We later heard that the consultant went into the fitting room with our bride after that discussion and tried to gossip about how we were ""being very snippy"" and ""making a scene."" What was she supposed to say? We didn't want to put her in an awkward position, but I've never had anyone make so many terrible faces at me while doing their job. (I'm actually a very nice person. I'm from Minnesota!) The tension between myself, the other bridesmaid, and the consultant continued and when he had enough he rudely passed his duties onto the manager. She was better but still not that helpful--wasn't listening to what N wanted, and also took an unnecessarily long time to return with dresses. 

I just need to stress further that the original consultant shot dirty looks toward the other bridesmaid and myself, quite obviously, every time he was in our vicinity.

This place is phenomenal! Just go here. Suggest small group (2-4) and go early around 5:30 - 6 pm on weekday or 5 pm weekend. Make it a 2 hour dinner journey to engage everything. And try to sit at the bar (group of 2). the bartenders are very helpful and quick: water, menus, alcohol, food. She held our hand for my lactose issues (described the entire menu and which items could be without milk products) and suggested drinks to fit our tastes.

First set of drinks: Gin's Tonic and Gimlet. Both very good. The tonic was a peach version so it tastes a little different, but good.

First course: special of the night: Lamb salami. WOW. Good portion and perfect starter. Comes on a plate with stone ground mustard, dijon mustard, pickled items, and some seed bread. The meat itself is very lightly salted and a light meat flavor (different from genoa salami, in a fresh way). The accompaniments really add a different flavor to the meat, allowing each bite to be a little different. But my favorite was the meat by itself.

Second course: Fried shiitake and oyster mushrooms. WOW. You had me at shiitake! but the addition of light breading, balsamic drizzle and lentils just takes the shiitake taste to that yummy earthy mushroom flavor. so good!

Second set of drinks: Brandy Old Fashioned and Bee's Knees. Bee's Knees, how do I love you? Very much! Found a new favorite drink in the Mad-town! I love honey, I love lemon, I love Gin! Now I love Bee's Knees! (It wasn't ""on"" the menu but the bartender suggested I'd like it after my tendency toward citrus drinks.) The secret ingredient was some fennel\/sugary topping. 
Brandy Old Fashioned - too heavy on the alcohol burn for my liking, but it tasted decent. The brandy soaked cherry was very tasty.

Third course: house made Buckwheat Cavatelli. WOW. me LEEKy! The cavatelli is a hearty, warm, soul filling dish. But the leeks really made it standout. The pasta is cooked then butter pan fried, tossed with the leeks and some daikon chunks. The daikon is a radish with a very slight sour flavor, which added something unique. 

Fourth course: Sea bass. Good. I am not a huge fan of sea bass, due to my previous experience of it tasting ""fishy."" I was raised in the Heartland on cows so Sea bass is what I consider a medium to heavy fish-flavored fish. But we ordered it b\/c the other big entrees were just too meaty or too milky. The sea bass was cooked perfect, with skin on one side. The flavor only hinted of fish, but could be hidden in the olive smear on the bottom of the plate. For those of you who like heavy omega oil fish, this might barely scratch that surface. For people like me that likes a light to medium fish flavor, Forequarter does a great job on keeping the fish flavor low. The best part about this dish was the pork chunks - yum! There was also  a potato cake in the dish. It was flakey and thick, but just felt heavy. It didn't seem to do much for the flavors in the dish.

Dessert: Cookie Plate. WOW! I love Macaroons! woo hoo! Did you know macaroons are just little cookie cakes? um YUM! I'm not sure if they make these in-house (I can't believe not), but the macaroons are just heavenly. The other 2 cookies on the plate are delicious too. All of them go great with the Baltimore Madeira.

After dinner, we were talking to another bar mate and the bartender informed me""I did not give you the Madeira you ordered, I am going to give you that one for free."" Say What?! Free? Really I wouldn't have known any better and I told her ""I didn't need a full pour, but would love to test the one I had ordered."" The one I had ordered was a Whiskey aged in Madeira barrels; the one I received was a simple Madeira. Whiskey is VERY different from Madeira! I am a Madeira convert! Yummy sweet wine thing! (The whiskey was a strong whiskey burn and smokiness with an underlying sweetness.)

Overall, this place is awesome. 4 out of 5 food items WOWed us. The drinks were great. Depending on your proximity and propensity toward eating and\/or drinking, you can easily spend $30 - $60\/person.",Restaurant
vUBXH5pMmUjw8cB78tqYwQ,w4Hgf7xlrDxNPTdC-J3CCw,RhEvP5flF6KoPriMHmVYGg,2011-03-30,"There is so much to love about this establishment, it could fill several reviews.  If that sounds like a great thing, it is.

First things first.  The Red Rock is visually striking.  From your first moments inside the red doors of the registration desk to your last moments in your room itself, you'll find nothing but well-appointed rooms and hallways with chic postmodern decor.  You are drawn in by the luxurious nature of the decor and fixtures, and kept enthralled by views that seem to get better with each stroll through the property.

The casino area contains several restaurants, all of the ones I visited were stellar.  A bowling alley, movie theater, intimate concert venue and several bars round out the interior.  As if all that isn't enough, an exquisite pool and spa can complete your experience.

When you start to adjust to the striking beauty of the complex, you begin to notice other things...like the fact that everyone you encounter here is wonderfully kind.  They all seem to actually care that you are satisfied, they all seem genuinely interested in what they can do to help you, and they are all just so darned friendly.  It makes for a warm, inviting experience...which is not something you tend to find in Vegas.  I encountered dozens and dozens of staff, and with only one exception which will be noted later, everyone from the bellmen to the housekeepers to the grounds staff were lovely.

The rooms are spacious, well laid-out, and well-appointed.  The bed was exquisitely comfortable, and the bathroom had a separate tub and shower.  This is a fabulous idea for any of you couples who are trying to get ready for dinner at the same time.  If you're the one who chose the tub, you'll have access to a TV that is mounted on the wall above the foot of the tub.  What a great way to relax!

Here comes the word of caution.  And it is a big one.  When you book your room, you'll be booking either a ""Canyon View"" or a ""Strip View"" room.  The problem is that the ""Strip View"" rooms from roughly the 6th floor down aren't ""Strip View"" rooms at all.  They are ""Parking Structure View"" rooms.  You see, one of the parking garages is more than four stories tall, and is located between the building and the Strip.  I have attached a picture of this so you can get a better idea of what I mean.  In my view, Red Rock ought not call them ""Strip View"" rooms, or ought to discount them a few bucks from the price of what a room with an actual ""Strip View"" would cost.  Since there is no way to guarantee what floor you'll get, I would recommend getting a ""Canyon View"" room instead.  The mountains are gorgeous and unobstructed, and the Strip is far off anyway.

That's the second issue, the lack of proximity to the Strip.  Many tourists think only of the Strip when they think Vegas.  For those folks from out of town, know that this casino is about 10 miles from the center of the Strip.  Those without perfect vision won't see any vestiges of the Strip at all, and those who are looking to hit the bars on Las Vegas Blvd are going to have an outrageous taxicab bill.  For those of us who don't like the smell of stale urine, or having our shoes vomited on by some girl in leopard print, this location is ideal.  It offers all the amenities of the Strip and less than half the vomit!

As previously mentioned, all but one staff member I encountered were wonderful, helpful, and kind.  The ""one"" happened to be a registration desk clerk.  As the person who tends to be the first point of contact with customers, it is doubly important that the registration desk clerks be on their game.  So for this young lady to be as brusque as she was with several folks who were coming and going before I got to her was a bit of a surprise.  When I approached her I was greeted with what could almost be called a sneer, and was given information that did not jive with what I had been told over the phone by the telephone registration clerks.  Things can easily get lost in translation, or miscommunicated between the desk and the phone operators, so I understand that.  What I didn't understand was her negative attitude.  I thought perhaps she was just having a bad day until I observed her the following day at the desk behaving in a similar manner.  Fortunately, I was being assisted by a different clerk who was friendly, kind, and helpful...which was the same as every other staff member I encountered.  I think this particular staff member is an aberration, but it is unfortunate that she'd be found at the first point of public contact.

So why the five-star review even with those gripes?  Because this place is just that good.  The Mustache is a known skeptic who is not easily impressed and doesn't fall for hype.  But in this case even I must admit that all the good things I had read about this establishment were spot-on.  It is a place where you will get precisely what you are paying for, and you'll feel like a king or queen for a night.  And you deserve nothing less.",Beauty

Bartender greeted us and sat us on the patio, with menus and went back to the bar to polish glasses or whatever they do when they aren't asking if they can get you a drink... we sat and took in the atmosphere, the ambiance, the décor, the view and about thirty other things while we waited and waited and waited for someone, anyone to drop by and say Hey! Six of those thirty other things were staff who never got close enough to call over without having to raise our voices or doing the annoying restaurant wave. So we waited some more. We turned it into a little game of How Long Do *you* Think.

Usually when you get a menu you can sort out what is on the cards and decide on your meal for the evening, drinks, whatever. Oh sure, you may have questions about some things, but in general the menu gives you the story. Not at Old School. I like barbecue and that was what I wanted. Brisket and some sides, maybe a couple of sauces. Nothing that you wont get at any place that BRAGS about their pit, which Old School does. So where on the menu can I find me some brisket? In a mess and maze of wordy condition, we finally find it under SIDES. WTF? BBQ is a side? 

Oh, and we were still waiting for someone to take a drink order. I figure I can ask about the brisket when that happens. Our wait person returns at a casual pace and we order two malted milkshakes, chocolate for me and strawberry for K. Off he goes. After another good opportunity to count the bricks in the wall, a different waiter approaches and deftly places a chocolate shake in front of me. He does the same for K, which is just wrong as she did not want chocolate. So K says that she ordered strawberry, and the waiter explains that our original waiter probably just double ordered the chocolate shakes by pressing the key twice on the screen, but that he will get it sorted out. It happens often enough that they know why it happens? Why not sort it out instead?

Our waiter appears and comes over with K`s shake and almost as an afterthought asks if we want food. I ask about getting brisket, and he explains that it is a side, I ask about getting it as a meal and he tells us he has to go check with the kitchen. Off he goes, and we wait some more. He returns and tells me I can order brisket and two sides for $15, which I do. K orders fried chicken. And then waiter is back to tell me that actually, I cannot have brisket and two sides for $15, the brisket is $15 and if I want sides they are extra. Okay, I have no problem with that except 1. The price for the brisket is nowhere on the menu and 2. I was told that Brisket and two sides would be $15. I ask how much, you tell me how much, I order. Make food, bring food, done deal. Not at Old School. Annoyed, I order a burger with fries.

We wait some more. The table behind us arrived, ordered and ate in the time it took to get our food. We would have asked about it but the staff were unable to make it all the way to our section of the patio. Not because it was crowded, or busy, or out of the way. They just seemed more interested in hanging out as far away from the customers as possible. Food arrives, and it is good. The burger is quite tasty, good texture to the beef and just slightly overcooked. The fries, however, tell a different tale. Did you ever go skiing in the 70's and get fries that came with that weird red spice shit that tasted exactly like weird red spice shit? Now I get what Old School means...

K's chicken is over-breaded and the paper placed on the tray disintegrates and becomes part of her meal. The coleslaw is good, though, and you do not have to ingest any part of the serving dishes along with it. She did get her shake, and they were good, although overly sweet and over priced by about $3.

This is getting long, but that is how our evening felt. Long. Drawn out. Tedious. We had to get up and go find someone to give us a bill, as our waiter had told us as he dropped our food that he had been there since 10AM (it was now 7PM) and was so tired he had to get home... so imagine our surprise when he was hanging out with the six staff by the cash, well concealed in the ''store'' section of the restaurant. None of whom seemed interested in helping us, so we asked the guy standing and looking at the cash register in what looked like horror and disinterest if we could please pay. He asked us for our bill, and K said, Well, no, no-one brought it which is why we were here, asking him for it. He gives us the wrong bill (he had three to choose from) and when we get the correct one it has a charge for brisket on it. He gets annoyed at having to take it off and I tell K I am going to be outside. Where I will remain for the rest of my days, as I will never set foot in Old School again.*

I first found Sakana when I lived within walking distance of the small eatery. It wasn't until I moved 10 miles away did I start eating there. 

My first time I ate there was almost two years ago. I remember being surprised that there was a line outside. From my limited experience with amazing, line-worthy restaurants this, typically meant a good thing. Long story short, I wasn't disappointed.

Sakana is a small sushi bar and restaurant tucked away at the end of a large strip mall. Its rather easy to miss the first time you drive by. I have always been impressed that the sushi chefs are Asian (I'm sorry but I always have found irony in how other ethnicity's cook and prepare another ethnicity's food. I'm not German, I'm not going to pretend I can cook German food well - Italian, well, that's another story... moving on). The place can seat about 10 people at the bar, another 50-60 people at tables and despite the amount of people the place can hold it's rather comfortable. The lighting is dim, the music is not intrusive and unless it's a Friday or Saturday its very easy to hear the group you're with even when it spans 2 or 3 tables.

Except for spring rolls (which are totally fabulous) I haven't ordered anything besides sushi & salmon nigiri. This is hands-down the best sushi I have had in Arizona. The fish does not taste like that terrible fishy flavor that makes you wonder if it's fresh or if you'll end up sick the next day, it has the flavor of the fish you are meant to be eating. The nori is rarely ever bitter, salty, chewy or pungent. Only a handful of times out of the dozen that I have been there have I ever been disappointed in the flavor, texture or presentation of the roll.

Personally I get the same thing every time I go. A Philidelphia roll and an avocado roll inside out (I like my rice outside the nori, thank you). They're my favorite and 9 times out of 10 perfectly made. It's pretty fabulous that the roll pretty much never falls apart which irks me at other places to no end. The salmon is well flavored and very smooth - it practically melts in your mouth.

Other sources (some being people that I have converted to Sakana Groupies) tell me that the soft-shell crab roll is amazing. Their spicy tuna is fabulous (again doesn't taste like over powering canned tuna) and their eel roll has a surprisingly light taste, it's not as heavy or chewy as I would have thought. Order some rolls, snag some hot green tea (or some chilled cranberry sake) and appreciate some really great sushi rolls. I could do a whole review on just one roll alone...

Beyond their rolls their nigiri (a piece of fish over a bed of rice) is great. Dab some wasabi on it, dip it in some soy and enjoy. A good friend of mine orders nothing but their nigiri - seriously they ordered about 16 pieces. If they have Toro on their list of sashimi, get some. You will not be disappointed..

Other people have mentioned their amazing specials. They're open for lunch now and you can easily get out of there for about 8 bucks (1 or 2 rolls and water to drink). They have a great selection on their Customer Appreciation list (has about 8-12 rolls on there) and offer every evening at least one different dinner special in addition to the 5-10 specials they're offering that night. On the other hand, with a large enough party, you can also end up leaving with a tab in the hundreds. But it's worth it. 

If it's only you or you're there with a small group (2 or 3) sit at the bar. You learn some pretty awesome things about preparation and some insider sushi secrets sitting at the bar chatting with the sushi chefs :) 

Let me know if you want to go... I don't pass up a trip to Sakana :D",Restaurant

There aren't too many spots in Cleveland that have nailed the middle-of-the-road gastropub thing and I think Jammy Buggar's has done it. In a nutshell when you come to this place you're sure to get good food that won't have you taking out a second mortgage on your already worthless home that's paired with a beer list that'll keep most brew geeks comfortably and happily inebriated.

We sat at the bar during our visit and couldn't have been happier with the level of service. Our bartender was genuinely friendly with just the right amount of attention. If there's one thing that can turn me off immediately it's an overly attentive waitstaff. It's nice to see when someone gets it right.

The beer list here is a strong B with 20 rotating taps and 50 or so bottled selections. Some of the standout draught selections on the day of our visit were Great Lakes Rally Drum Red (essentially an IPA dressed as an amber ale) and Breckenridge 471 (one of my favorite imperial IPAs). The draught list features a well-balanced mix of local, regional and big box beers and the bottles list packs some of its own surprises - Thirsty Dog Cerberus Belgian Tripel and Mickey's malt liquor served in a brown paper bag for those nights you feel like slumming it.

We went the sandwich route on our first visit:

The Susan Flipping the Bird - This is their Susan sandwich (tomato, avocado, buffalo mozzarella, roasted garlic pesto on focaccia) with, what else, chicken (+$3). All sandwiches come with house-cut fries but my wife opted for the coleslaw. The sandwich was perfect. Soft focaccia, crispy fresh veggies, soft melty cheese and tender juicy chicken. As a self-professed slaw snob I rarely find slaw that I like. JB's nailed it. Creamy, sweet, mayo-based (as it should be) and simple. 

The Almost Downtown Chicken Hogie - I think I could eat this sandwich every day. A soft and crispy hogie roll packed with grilled chicken, provolone cheese, so-thick-you'll-smack-your-mamma bacon, fried onions, and garlic aioli. In a vain attempt to make this meal seem a tad healthier (I said vain, didn't I?), I opted for the sweet potato waffle fries. The fries were great and the honey mustard dipping sauce was a nice surprise.

The dessert that I forgot - We also had a dessert of some kind, something like a cinnamon roll thing with nuts and ice cream maybe some apples...unfortunately, I waited too long to write this thing so I don't remember exactly what it was. Suffice it to say, it was good.

Jammy Buggar's is a welcome addition to the Cleveland dining scene. They really fill a space that's been dominated far too long by mega-corporate chains that serve processed psuedofoods - budget friendly tasty food minus the frills. Its unpretentious take n gastropub fare along with a generous craft-brew heavy beer list will make them a regular on my to-eat list.",Restaurant
6Dib1xMJ-fSKeUHcfJCiRQ,52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,364hhL5st0LV16UcBHRJ3A,2014-09-30,"Finally, after a couple of months of well-intentioned attempts, we made our way to Yonaka for a night of munching and imbibing.  We wanted to eat slow, drink slow, and make a relaxing night of this Friday evening.  So imagine our surprise when we enter the place, and it is a... restaurant.  Now, you could ask, why didn't I check Yelp to see if it was indeed an izakaya.  I typically do that, but for some reason I didn't bother to confirm.  Well, when every time you punch in ""izakaya"" on search and this place pops up at one of the very first ones...

Anyway, it turns out the experience was worthwhile, so I'm not complaining too much.  If you take it for what it is - an upscale Japanese small dish RESTAURANT - it is quite a unique experience.  The restaurant is attractive - modern, grey-neutral tone, open space - with a large sushi bar area across the back.  The front host as well as all the staff are very pleasant and quite professional in appearance and demeanor.  They really make all the efforts to make this as upscale as it looks and costs, and succeed at it quite well.  Despite what it was not, our expectations rose a notch or two.

We ordered the 8-course omakase, which was recommended by our server as appropriate for 2-3 people.  She was spot on, as we struggled to finish the complete package and left the very good dessert only half-empty.  At $106, the 8-course is quite a bargain.  Here is what we got:
 - Bowl of Pan-fried(?) brussell sprouts which had a great toasty-tangy taste to it, although it came with no accompaniments and was much too salty for that
 - Sake Orenji, which is sashimi slice of salmon and orange with clear sauce.  Delicious.
 - Hotategai & strawberry is big slices of scallops and strawberry.  Interesting flavor, but I think it would be hit or miss depending on your take on the combination.  I liked it, mainly because I love both ingredients.
 - Hamachi & grapefruit is the same theme as previous two with yellowtail & said fruit.  Again, depends on your taste but I liked it as well.
 
We are starting to get full at this point, and then the heavy stuff starts coming
 - Pork Belly w\/Kimchi is 6 THICK pieces of pork belly with side of lettuce-like kimchi.  Pork is sweet and kimchi is semi-spicy, and the combination goes well.  At this point we are really wishing for a side of rice to tame all the raw flavors.
 - Angus Beef w\/Mushrooms was my least favorite, because there was a bit of fishiness to the beef.  The sauce and shroom mix made me wish the beef was better, because that was a great combo otherwise.
 - Flounder w\/dried Chorizo and potatoes - We are completely full at this point and I wish I had the stomach for this, because it was really good.  Probably the best dish of the course.
 
The 8th course is the dessert, which they mercifully waited a while to serve.  Still, we could only eat half of the combo of Green Tea Brownie, Strawberry Mint ice cream, and the vanilla ice cream.  The strawberry cream is quite unique, as the mint flavor is as if I was actually chewing on mint leaves.

That plus a hot sake resulted in a $160 bill after tips, which is a relative bargain.  While the taste of each dish with the strange recipe was largely dependent on the diner's preferences, the presentation and quality was top notch.  Regardless of your personal preference, this place deserves a 4-star or more.  We need more places like this.

Table-for-1 Factor:  They have a large bar so that might work, but the atmosphere is wholly for dates and good conversations for larger groups.  So I wouldn't recommend it.",Restaurant

There are some delicious donuts here in the Phoenix area (Lamar's, Bosa) and I was excited to see a new shop opening up on Bell Rd.  I drive down Bell Rd to work every morning and for the last few weeks, I had seen a sign out front that said ""Coming Soon"".  Well, I drove by it the other day and it was changed to ""Grand Opening"".  I decided to stop in and sample their goods.  I parked, walked in and here is how everything went down...........

I got in the place and there were 2 people working, a man..who seemed to be the donut maker, and a lady who was working the front ringing people up.  There was a lady already at the register who had placed her order for some donuts and was waiting on a coffee or something.  They have one of those coffee machines that you find at cheap gas stations...the kind where you put your cup underneath it and then press a button and it comes dripping out.  Well...that wasn't working so well.  Something was wrong with the coffee maker and the guy employee\/owner was taking it to the back to get it fixed?  Anyways...the lady finally was rung up , grabbed her donuts and was on her way.  

While all this was going on, it gave me some time to browse their selection.  They had pretty basic offerings and I had a general idea of what I was going to get.  There was one other guy in line in front of me.  It was his turn to order.  This is where it went a little hectic (I was running a bit late to begin with and I figured I would just pop in, grab some donuts and be out in a few minutes....that did not happen and here is why.)  The guy in front of me starts asking the people if they can ""fill a chocolate long john"".  I instantly made my ""you have to be fucking kidding me face"" and shook my head.  Hey...I'm all about freedom of choice.  We live in America, damn it!  But if there is a line of people behind you, just choose from what they have in the case.  This isn't ""Donut Throwdown"" and the last time I checked, ""create your own donut day"" falls on February 30th!  Get outta here..........  Anyways...the nice people that own the place granted his request and went and got the jelly donut filling machine, popped his long johns in there and gave it a squirt.  He replied with, ""I always liked those as a kid.""  I felt like replying with, ""Where the fuck did you get your donuts from as a kid?  I've never in my life seen a jelly filled chocolate long john.  Anyways......he was on his way.

It was finally time to get my donuts.  I went with a regular glazed, a raspberry filled jelly donut, a  double chocolate cake donut and a chocolate covered buttermilk bar.  A tad under $4.00 later, I was out the door.  Here is how the donuts were..........

Regular Glazed-  Very light and airy.  When you bit down, it was like a soft pillow collapsing.  The donut had good texture and a good amount of glaze.  It was probably my favorite of the bunch and I would definitely get it again.

Raspberry Jelly Donut-  Once again, this was a very light and airy donut.  The jelly filling was just alright.  It was not sweet enough and the jelly part didn't have the best texture.  Decent but not a standout donut.

Double Chocolate Cake-  This donut was pretty small.  The overwhelming theme of all the donuts I tried was that they were not too sweet.  The chocolate icing was pretty thin and the donut itself was soft.  I like a little crunch\/texture when I bite into a cake donut.  Sadly, this one did not have either.  I would not get this one again.

Chocolate Covered Buttermilk Bar-  Why do buttermilk bars always have the thickest icing?  My buddy said it perfect... ""It's like buttermilk bars coating is ice creams Magic Shell of the donut world"".  I couldn't have said it better myself. This donut didn't have the great ""tang"" of a good buttermilk bar.  It was pretty small too.  Probably wouldn't get it again.

Overall, this place is ok.  The lady working the counter was nice and friendly, the donuts wont break the bank, but there are better donuts out there.  This might be a good donut for Surprise (compared to Dunkin or store brands), but it's not in the same ballpark as others I mentioned before.  I will probably be back at some point.  It's on the way to work and its conveniently located so I'm sure Ill stop back in. I also like to support mom and pop type stores when possible.  Stick to the glazed and you will be alright.",Restaurant
whmj_cMq3SjTAys3-eqrng,7RCz4Ln_FaTvNrdwe251Dg,Y9TialvINU0jf0GXaCXuiA,2017-06-20,"I can has admits, there were some ""what the heck is happening in this hood, some kind of invasion?"" kind of hesitation running between me and a friend when we first saw signs that a place like this wants to set up shop in East Chinatown of all places. I thought I'd give it a few whirls when it opened for reals before I start judging. At least it's not another clandestine ""spa"" in the hood.

Farside (because apparently to many Toronto's hipster westenders, crossing the Don is like entering another country, lolz) quickly became a highly rated new bar amongst the local media reviewers (BlogTO, NOW mag, etc.--and then they go on to fetishize Gerrard East as the city's next hot area, lolz). It's run by Rachel Conduit and Mike Reynolds, a couple who amongst each other over the years have carved out a rep for running some highly favoured bars, like Kensington Market's Handlebar (whatever happened to that cheetah?), and the former Avro once not too far down from here (which everyone, including the media reviewers and their great grandmothers, like to reminisce like it's their long dead favorite uncle, lolz). Them eastenders are back east, and their regulars will probably feel right at home crossing into the proper side of the Don in this new digs they staked out.

THE VIBE: they def went for a living room\/basement rec room feel. It kinda does too remind me of my friend's dad's dingy Cambodian restaurant that used to be a few doors down, or the many friends and relatives' rec rooms I wasted my youth on video games and surviving horrible karaoke. Farside is unabashedly hipsta, but also comfortable enough that you need not feel out of place (or in another country, lolz). The kitschy nostalgic 80s\/90s theme game is strong--c'mon, they even serve birthday cake on a Spice Girls plate! A few vintagey couches and tables complement the spacious bar space.

They play all sorts of old stuff on that back projector screen. Loud tunes get spinning​ usually on the weekends, but I particularly like Monday nights, cuz that's when they run a series of VHS movies (you can find out what they plan on screening in advance, either at the door or on their Instagram:). VCR tech is the shit I grew up on man, digital is too weird. Moreover, Farside dedicate part of their ops to supporting local artists, such as regularly rotating the illustration on their menu cover, hosting events, or that back studio room they carved out with an artist-in-residence program to go along with it

DRINKS: You like a blast of spicy, punk? Me too. Then try the Chili Gonzales (yes, as in that music guy). They also obviously got a well versed picking of craft beer. Heck, Mike will even warn you if your choice is highly boozy. Who does that, eh? Certainly no bartender in downtown clubland!

Whoa I'm getting carried away here, so I'll end it by saying that the Farside vibe is certainly chill and mature (as in folks who appreciates the struggles of life before high speed internets). It's quite strangely low-key too most of the time, even on a Saturday night, and sometimes you might find a crew inside playing Magic: The Gathering. Their presence​, along with AAA Bar next door, adds an bubble of some life in a strip that otherwise is dead quiet (aside from the handful of Chinese and pho restaurants opening into the night). And honestly, their existence in this enclave of far way legendary land of eastside Toronto has been more respectful than that goddamned weed dispensar(ies) around the corner from here, so go ahead and drown yourself on some cocktails and cheesy 80s CGI.",Restaurant

We went back to Breadfruit last night, and I must revise my original review to reflect our experience, which deserved more stars.

When we arrived at 7pm on Saturday night, the place was packed.  There wasn't enough room to push two tables together in order to accommodate our party of 4, so we walked around the block until some tables were open.  The waitress was extremely nice and we were seated about 20 minutes later.

For appetizers, we ordered the avocado spring rolls and the roasted plantains.  Despite being small portions, they were both very good.  I was inspired to go get some plantains in the Asian market this morning in order to try to make them at home.

As an entree, I ordered the curried tofu again.  I wanted to try something else (the Ital soup or the veggie patty), but they were out of a vital component of each dish, and they don't make the soup in the summer.

When my entree came out, I was initially really disappointed to see that they had made it with chicken, again.  I asked the waitress and she assured me that what I was seeing was actually a soy product and I had nothing to worry about.  I must say, it was disturbingly, uncomfortably meat-like.  So much so that I made my husband try it and tell me that it was in fact non-meat before I would put it in my mouth.  When I did eat it, it even had the texture of meat - very disconcerting.  The flavor was excellent, and I would definitely order this entree again - if I can get over the extremely realistic meat analog.  The sides were good (definitely better flavor since last time), especially mixed with the curry sauce.

I have to issue a heartfelt apology to Wayne and The Breadfruit for the disparaging review that I wrote after my last visit.  I should have called to ask about the dish and had them clarify that my dish was, in fact, fake meat.  It has been so long since I ate chicken (and I don't generally eat fake meat), that I truly thought it was meat.  (Lesson:  Don't assume anything!)

My dinner companions all ordered a chicken dish, and all enjoyed them thoroughly.  I tried the festivals (breadstick) from someone's meal, and I have to say that Breadfruit should offer a basket of those as an appetizer.  Yum.

When we were almost finished with our meal, the waitress brought us full sized samples of the carrot juice.  Another Yum!  It tasted a lot like Thai Iced tea - similar seasonings, and very rich and creamy.  

I will definitely go back to Breadfruit.  The food was good (Festivals=crack), the atmosphere and the service is EXCELLENT, and it is close to home.  

Home Run, Breadfruit.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Downtown Phoenix NEEDS a Jamaican restaurant (and an Ethiopian, Italian, Mexican, etc), and I have waited anxiously for Breadfruit to open - riding my bike by there every afternoon for weeks looking for any sign of life.  

Finally, just this week, I see people eating there.  So, we went for lunch today ( at 12:45... at the end of the lunch rush), of course, we arrived at the exact same moment  as Phil Gordon.   I think we threw them off a little bit by ordering our meal to go, but they don't get a by for that.

The wait was long (35 minutes), but they were really busy, and they just opened, and the mayor was there, so it was understandable.  We forgave.  The lone waiter brought me a Fiji water, It tided me over slightly.

I was excited to see several ""vegan"" options on the menu - mostly sides, but it looks like some of the entrees can be modified to fit vegetarian requirements.  

I ordered the curried tofu (that is the name printed on the menu, no modifications!), which comes with sides of steamed plantains, beans\/rice, and steamed cabbage\/green bell peppers.

Unfortunately, I recieved curried chicken, a fact that I discovered after getting back to my office... and I was WAY too starving to go back to get it fixed.  I ate around the chicken, something I am normally loathe to do... but as I said, STARVING.

The beans and rice = bland.  Nothing spectacular, they were just that: beans and rice.

Plantains = undercooked.  Just slightly.  I wanted them to be so much better than they were.

Cabbage\/Green Bell pepper = boring.  They were just steamed cabbage and green pepper.  I love cooked cabbage, but with salt please!

Nothing that I ate was seasoned at all.  I had bite or two of the curry sauce since it was touching the rice (starving!), and it tasted ok... am I allowed to pass judgement on a sauce that was poured over something I don't ever eat (because I think it is disgusting)?  Its hard to say.

Admittedly, I would have enjoyed this meal A LOT more if I had recieved a meal that did not contain meat.  

I will probably go back... Breadfruit is new, and they deserve another chance.  I will definitely eat in, and I will try David's reccomendation of the avocado rolls.

T6hYdytLTaWn9iO1x4JrUA,PC3rlHXfe3Vg8t2zYP6wgQ,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2010-03-10,"I wish I did a walk through before booking a room here.  I'm in my suite, on my bed as I write this review.  Vdara seems like a 4 star hotel when you initially walk in, however you soon realize that this hotel is not all that it seems.  

The service is a solid three.  Nobody was rude, everyone was friendly and helpful, but there were instances where it lacked precision, poise and confidence.  An example of this would be with the concierge.  I called them to ask about about having a messenger pick up a BB Tour charger and deliver to the suite.  Over the phone, he was very helpful and said that I should come downstairs to check their chargers to see if any one of them worked.  I don't mean to sound like a princess, but I honestly did NOT want to walk my lazy ass downstairs.  I had  been working all day setting up our booth for a trade show and just wanted someone to come up and show me the chargers so I can pick the one that fits and put my feet up and RELAX.  So I walk my lazy butt downstairs to the concierge and find her helping another guest.  I wait for 5 minutes and can't wait longer so walk over to the front desk and they of course tell me to go back to the concierge.  I'm back in line behind the same couple asking all sorts of questions about some show seating.  I wait another 5 minutes and the concierge looks over to me says that she will be awhile and asks me what I needed in a slight annoyed and definitely hurried fashion.  I tell her another concierge told me to come down to pick up a charger.  She then literally dumps a bunch of chargers my way and tells me to choose one.  By this time I'm feeling like I interrupted Mommy and Daddy at a really busy time.  WTF!!!  Anyways, none of the chargers fit so I walked my ass to the business center as a just in case and surely they had one that fit.  Initially they told me to leave my phone there while it was being charged, but I asked if I could take the charger up to my room, since I needed my phone for business.  They said no problem and I gave them my room number and happily left that I didn't have to pay for a brand new one.
When I got back to my room later that evening, I had a message from the business center saying that if I wanted to keep the charger for the duration of my stay, they would charge me $5 a day.  I still don't know how I really feel about that.  I screwed up and forgot my charger, but I just don't feel good about it.

The rooms are nice.  It seems impressive, but again it's an illusion.  For example, the sunken in oval bath tub is nice.  Visually it looks porcelain, but it's plastic.  The LIGHTS!!!  WTF is up with the lights.  The switch turned on the ALL the lights, but you couldn't turn on the side lamps  by the couches unless the main lights were on.  It was weird.  They do have a kitchen and I guess it would be useful if you were cooking, but didn't need any utensils or plates or even kitchenware to cook your food in.  This is HIGH CLASS CAVE MAN LIVING!!  Seriously, what were they thinking!!  Who is gonna book room at a nice hotel and bring all the kitchenware with them??!!  The place just didn't make sense!

Housekeeping is a 3 at best.  They came and cleaned the rooms, but our tub was dirty.  We had a epsom salt bath the night before and when we got back to our room, we realized that the tub was still had epsom salt stuck to the bottom of it.  The Q-tips and cotton balls weren't replaced and the toiletry in the shower wasn't put away.  All the other housekeeping service did this in every other hotel we stayed in including MGM, Wynn, and Luxor.

The ONE restaurant that VDARA has is NOT open for dinner.  I can understand why.  The restaurant is just entirely BORING!  They probably can't afford to leave it open, since there may be all of 2 tables booked for the entire place.  

The BEST thing about Vdara was the spa.  We booked a couple's massage and our masseuse were fantastic.  Really enjoyed that!!

All in all, this hotel is for guests who are in Vegas strictly for business.  If you want pleasure with your business go somewhere else.  If a non-gaming hotel is what your looking for, Four Seasons may be in order!

i guess you get what you pay for.  The rooms are pretty cheap for what you get.",Beauty

I would go back, and their effort gets an A+.  but ... there's a story here ... so read on if you so wish as my reviews can occasionally ramble on and on and on and on :D.  


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


First let me say that I am a big fan and regular at the King west location, and occasional patron of the Esplanade.  Friends organized a birthday dinner, and selected this new Sherway location as the venue.  

This place has just recently opened, so I cut them a very slight bit of slack to iron out the kinks and get this restaurant running smoothly. 

Our experience started out with a reservation 3 weeks in advance (for 10ppl).  32 hours prior to our start time last night, we call in to update that we have an extra person joining us.  They say ""no"".  Their reasoning on the phone was that they were fully booked, and that they'd already tacked chairs onto a table for 8 for our group of 10.  Shocked, we ask and what if that meant we'd cancel the entire reservation?  The girl goes to (presumably) speak with a manager and returns to the phone to say ""no"".  

I was so stunned by this that I promptly wrote up a YELP review --- to my happy surprise, the 1st review for the restaurant :).  I then proceeded to paste a link to my review on the Bier Markt facebook wall (which was 'managed' so wasn't displayed to the public).  I suggested to them that it wasn't too late to fix this problem, and that was all.  I was prepared to not go (as I was the 11th person), but had a glimmer of hope that they would see it and fix it.  And they did!

I commend Bier Markt (and\/or their social media content manager) for first off seeing the post, and much more so for replying to it WITH A SOLUTION.  They ended up giving  us a table to accommodate the party - the ""chef's table"" which was a beautiful solid oak wooden table in a semi-private knook adjacent to the bar area.  Good job for fixing the less than hospitable reservation experience, despite having to resort to my super-human, Elite powers in the Yelp community to urge this ;)

The hostesses were absolutely lovely upon entering.  Warm and friendly and brought us to our table with a smile.  Our petite vixen of a waitress was just as charming and attentive.  

Having put myself through school and traveled the world as a waiter and bartender, I have great respect and admiration for good service and the hospitality industry in general ... but I can also be very discerning and critical.  

The beers were all of course great, although they didn't have one I'd requested in stock.  The food was very good, and at those price points what I would demand.  My bit of feedback (as I know the good folks of the Bier Markt are checking back for this review) is regarding 'running' the food.  Not a single runner (whether for beers, tea or the food) had a clue who ordered what.  For a $20-50 entrees while drinking $6-20 gourmet beers, I expect the runners and\/or server to direct exactly the right dish to the right person without disrupting our conversation or making us try to figure out if that is the pork schnitzel or veal schnitzel.  The biggest problem on the running was that 2 guests had ordered the black angus burger.  One rare and one medium-well.  They weren't marked with a coloured toothpick or anything, and the runners didn't even know how each was cooked.  We had to cut into them to guess.  Turned out they were both well, which was close enough for one easy going and hungry soul.  But Dave the blood thirsty burger eater had to wait 10 minutes into our meals to get his rare burger remade.  I get it - mistakes can happen ... but when you're automatically adding a gratuity onto the bill, and charging the prices they do ... I expect more than these kinds of rookie hospitality industry gaffs.  

So in summary - I am not writing this detail to slam the Bier Markt at all ... I'm writing it to encourage them to give the excellent level of service that I've come to enjoy at the King street location.

A+ for turning the experience around from an almost tragic blunder ... I hope you can instill this sense of hospitality management and customer service into each and every one of your staff.",Restaurant
nNg-YxCWIJHfTtaZVChMyg,sAfWklqwCEpmICR2aIejDQ,J0VhheD10-2A1iYm_5T6wQ,2017-01-28,"I should have walked out when the first thought that ran through my head was, ""Is that receptionist on crack?""  

No kidding...this woman was on something, and she was as spaced out as they come.  Black lady, finger nails as long as shit, and she couldn't even get me checked in.  One of the stylists came over, walking like a zombie, and without saying more than 2 words, helped the receptionist to the right screen. Realizing the lady still couldn't check me, the stylist checked me in. Then as if she was contemplating slitting her wrists as soon as she clocked out, the stylist walked back to the poor soul waiting in her chair, who was going to have this woman with sharp objects in her hands, waiving them about her head and eyes.

But have you ever been so surprised to see something so fucked up that you stayed just to make sure that, yes, in fact, this place is truly as fucked up as they come.  Well, I did. There's just regular crappy service, where you just leave, and then there's this... an opportunity to see just how fucked up a business can get and to sit back and watch the Holy Hell that is Cost Cutters on Bell and Tatum, go about their business. 

I sat back and waited about 20 minutes and watched this crazy ass lady at the front desk stare at her tiger claws, stare at the ceiling, and pick at her skin and teeth. Every time someone came in I watched as she tried to figure out the computer, failing repeatedly, and once again someone had to come over and help her, silently scooting her over, as I realized that the stylists had long ago given up all hope this woman could do anything other than keep her chair warm.  Even when people checked out she didn't do a damn thing.  She just sat back, head looking quickly left, then right, never stopping.  And I think she was chewing gum, but I don't think there was any gum in her mouth. So she was just chewing...like a cow.

Then it was my turn to get a haircut.  Another zombie came over and said my name with the enthusiasm of someone who just found out she had cancer and had 2 hours to live but was forced to spend those two hours cutting strangers hair. Without even looking around at the folks in the room she started shuffling back to her chair, me getting up and quickly following suit as I noticed the tattoo on the back of her neck which I think exclaimed, ""Daddy's Girl!""

She was a big girl.  I'll leave it at that.

I keep my hair simple and short... like her.  So, she did a pretty good job, but didn't say a word.  No doubt she was thinking of the life she could have had if she had made better choices, but instead she was doing a #1 cut on my head, on a Saturday afternoon, contemplating all the dreams she may have had as a child that were now gone, and replaced with a revolving door of strangers needing basic head maintenance.

After finishing my cut, which took all of 3 minutes, she grabbed her blow dryer and shot me in the face with it.  Whatever happened to those nice, soft, brushes that stylists used to gently brush away the hair from your face.  Now...you see the blow dryer coming and you have just seconds to quickly close our eyes, lest you forget and your corneas get sand blasted.

I walked back to the counter where the living ghost of Whitney Houston had one of her shoes off and was banging it on the counter.  I pulled out my wallet, then credit card, and handed it in her direction, only to see the arm of the woman who just cut my hair swoop in from the side and grab it, and run it through the machine.  I don't think the receptionist even knew we were there as she now was putting back on her shoe but had apparently seen something underneath the counter and was craning her neck sideways to get a better look. I couldn't help but think of Pink Floyd...""Hello, is there anybody In there?""

I tipped the lady my regular 3 bucks...which is about a buck a minute... and then walked out the door and back into the world I knew; a safe world, one that didn't have creepy people doing strange, depressing things to other people scalps.  The feeling was similar to when I walked out of a movie theater years earlier after watching Silence of the Lambs, shaking my head to get the thoughts and visions out of my head.  The only difference being that it was a movie, and Cost Cutters is real...very, very real.",Beauty
FVqzGJW8zfzJaZJE32UJMA,3sUgf3PWFdPs142jUJ5pgw,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2013-08-16,"I wanted to love the Vdara, i really did, but too many things went wrong during our stay.

The main problem we encountered was the service provided by the hotel staff. They failed to follow through on anything they promised. That sums it up. I will go into details, but there are a lot of them. 

Found problems with:
- The Valet
- Front Desk
- Bellboy
- Room Service
- Room Quality

The hotel only offers Valet Parking. Not a major problem, unless the hotel has bad service, which it does. 

Valet takes forever!! And if you love your car, you don't want these guys getting behind the wheel. PERIOD.

We had booked a corner suit. Around $350 per night. Check in is at 3pm. We arrived at 4pm. We were told we could have a suit on the 29th floor but if we could wait 2 hours to check in, we could have a room on the 47th floor. We thought it was worth the wait! The front desk told us we would receive a call when our room was ready and we could check it, 2 hours max we were told. 

We had to leave our bags with the bellboy. We would have left them in the car but with it only being valet, that wasn't an option. We handed our bags over and the guy serving us paused before handing us our receipt and said ""unfortunately i only work outside and i don't bring your bags to the room"". After which there was an awkward silence while i waited to be handed the receipt. It wasn't until after that i realized this was an attempt to get tipped. REALLY? You didn't do anything! Since when do you have to tip twice for one service? .. Not a great start.

We eventually went back to the hotel at 8pm, after waiting 4 hours and receiving no phone call. We go to the front desk and are told the 47th room floor isn't ready yet, but there is one on the 29th floor if we didn't want to wait any longer. We're already 4 hours into waiting, hell no, i'm not going to bail out now!

After the front desk being on hold to room service for 20 minutes, we're told our room is ready. When we get to the door, we find them leaving the room. Anyway .. we're in! And the room is amazing! Fantastic views, very modern decor, let the fun begin. 
If only ....

The carpet in the bedroom is soaked through. Wet all over! Like excess water sqelching when you step on it! I call down to the front desk to complain and they offer to move us to a room on the 29th floor. It's now almost 9pm! We waited 5 hours for this room! When the bellboy comes up to drop off our bags, he offers to have extra towels sent up so we can try and mop up a bit. He was a really nice guy, very apologetic and he did make us feel better. The corner suit also comes with a pull out Queen bed which we intended to use. The bellboy tells us we can have the pull out bed made up by room service if we tell him a time.

OK great. We tell him midnight (it's currently 9pm). I figure that's long enough for them to get the job done, even with bad service. WRONG. We come back at 1am and it's not done!! We call to complain AGAIN, go back out to hit the strip, come back at 4am and there is a pillow and a folded sheet on the couch. So after it taking so long, they decided not make it and just drop the linens off .. Why would it take so many hours to drop that off! It does't even take that long to make, never mind drop off. Bad bad bad.

$350+ per night!! For service like that! Insane. The commercials on the hotel TV also advertise how high the hotel standards are and you're urged to ""Raise your expectations"". Seriously though. I didn't even have any expectations and you didn't meet them.

The pull out bed was also solely made of springs. I've used more comfortable beds in hostels i've stayed in, not even exaggerating slightly. Also, the shower looks amazing, its huge. But the water pressure was laughable. 

On a side note: the hotel doesn't have a casino. I learned The Vdara is just an extension of The Aria. So just stay in the Aria, unless they have the same management. I'm not risking The Aria after this experience, but who knows, it surely can't be any worse.",Beauty
jsx4NzK7kAa1spnwfnZPjQ,QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,pIBuAyEGx8yMtJf6k1j3yA,2014-05-06,"The newly opened Martinez Taco Bar is a family run joint located in the Aliante area, just East of the 215. Inside the restaurant you'll find a handful of tables, a couple booths and the counter with built in salsa bar and a somewhat open kitchen behind it. For as big as this location is, the dining area is fairly small but luckily, additional seating can be found outside.

Alongside traditional items like tacos and burritos, MTB is also serving up some surf 'n turf options, signature tacos and even burrito bowls. Pricing is similar to other taco joints with tacos ringing in at $2, vampiros at $4 and burritos at $7. It appears that they run specials, or plan to at some time as there was a white board in the window with prices that didn't match either the menu, or their hand written chalkboard sign inside. 

Of course I had to try their al pastor! For whatever reason, the spit wasn't going and I assume they pre-cut the meat. If you prefer nice, thin slices of al pastor, you won't find it here. The meats cut chunky and it's also pretty crispy, almost to the point of being burnt. Flavor was okay but nothing great and because it was overcooked, it was a bit dry. 

In hopes to sample some other meats they offer, I ordered a pollo asado and carne asada taco as well. They must have mixed up my order because I only ended up with 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos. No biggie but a bit disappointing. Thankfully, the carne asada was much better than the al pastor and although it was also cut really thick, it remained tender and juicy. The flavor was great and didn't need any sauce to be enjoyed.

A big part of the problem, aside from the meats, is the proportion of the tacos. One of them only had 1 tortilla and the others had 2 but they were really dry. Toppings wise, there was a huge amount of salsa and very little onions or cilantro. I had asked for pineapple on my al pastor tacos, which they confirmed twice, but ultimately forgot to add. While the sauce is decent and has a good bite, they put on way too much and it overpowers everything else. It's also much hotter then I expected and even though I love hot food, it was too hot for my son and he couldn't even finish eating.

MTB is not a full service restaurant and even though the counter service was great, they were understaffed and overwhelmed. Unfortunately, it showed. They only had one cook working at the time and even though they weren't super busy, it did take quite a while to get our food. And not only did they mess up our order, but several other guests around us had errors in theirs. 

Some simple planning and a couple extra hands would most likely make a huge difference in quality here. I do think they have potential and because of that, I'll come back in a month or so when they hopefully got the kinks worked out. But for now, unfortunately my dreams of getting a good taco spot in our neck of the woods have been crushed again!",Restaurant
8QQpu6wWmfrroF0jzfTK0Q,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,buTa1akbH0pO_P10v99_eA,2015-08-01,"I'm a little perplexed at this ""3 stars average rating"" nonsense. Honey Pig is clearly better than that.

It's been quite some time since I've done Korean BBQ in Vegas, but there's no way a meat eater can resist a friend's invitation to feast. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and beat the dinner rush handily. Our chairs were placed fairly close to each other on purpose, as we would learn later.

It was fairly obvious from the a la carte pricing that AYCE ($24.95 all-you-can-eat dinner, supposedly a 2 hour limit, but we didn't reach it) would be the way to go for variety's sake. Late night diners should be aware that although this restaurant is open 24\/7, AYCE is only available until 10pm. While they only allow a maximum of one portion of kalbi (beef short ribs) and one portion of beef sirloin with AYCE, the other options (bulgogi, pork belly, spicy pork belly, spicy squid, spicy chicken) are truly unlimited as long as you don't over-order.

Before the first round, they brought out banchan (the ubiquitous sides in Korean cuisine), which consist of bean sprouts, mini seafood pancakes, pickled veggies, and spicy cucumbers. The table space is essentially a circular ring that surrounds the circular grill, so the banchan were placed between the two of us. They also provided three dipping sauces (my simplistic summary: one salty, one sweet, and one spicy) and bowls of white rice.

For the actual first round, they threw kimchi and bean sprouts onto the grill along with bulgogi, then pork belly after the bulgogi had finished. They staged this on the opposite side of the circular ring so that they didn't get in our way. I wouldn't say that they totally follow through on the cooking process, but they will come back to turn the meat. Still, it feels like you can chopstick your way through it at any time and pull beef early to your liking, and that's a good thing. You should know that the outer edge of the grill will cook things more slowly, so relocate food there to avoid overcooking.

Anyway, the bulgogi and pork belly were both good, although I personally preferred the somewhat fatty pork belly. The sweet dipping sauce worked best with both, but I played around for variety's sake.

We wanted the kalbi and the beef sirloin for the second round, and they obliged. Both were actually marinated, and both stay pretty tender as long as you don't leave them on the grill for far too long. Yeah, we may have succumbed to this oversight. At least the properly cooked pieces tasted great!

Lastly, we had spicy chicken and also convinced them to mix it into an order of fried rice (+$2.95 per person). This fried rice is exciting because they cook it on the grill to pick up the meaty residues of the preceding deliciousness. It was certainly delicious overall. I'll admit that the spicy chicken and the leftover kimchi were a bit intense for me at first, but they were easier to handle once they'd cooled from hot to merely warm. Synergistic heat effects, you know. Anyway, they did allow us to box the leftovers of the fried rice (containing some chicken at this point) to go, and having food for the next day feels like more value than even taking the time to stuff yourself that night.

Nothing was totally mindblowing, but everything tasted very good, so why not 5 stars? Well, this is a bit nitpicky, but I'm disappointed with the limit on two types of especially delicious meat. It's understandable since some people can go absolutely H.A.M. on the food, but most places don't have that limit. Then again, my somewhat distant memories give me the impression that most AYCE places offer lower-quality meats. There is a second issue, however, in the lack of attention to giving more banchan. No server offered to bring more banchan, and one server outright said OK to more seafood pancakes, but never brought seconds.

I'll have to eat around more to make a more informed comparison, but I'm very comfortable giving Honey Pig 4 stars and decrying the ridiculous underrating by the ""average Yelper.",Restaurant

 I have driven by this place a couple times and thought it looked like a cool little joint. The bf and I love a good patio place, and from the street this looked like it fit the bill. We were jonesing for a little sunshine and a nice cold brew and decided to give this place a try.  When we pulled up and parked, I was really excited. It had a nice big patio with fire pits, booths and tables. We wandered onto the patio where we stood for a bit as servers passed us without greeting. Ok, did we come in the wrong way?  So we went inside to where again no one greeted us. Finally  there was kid (teenagerish) who after a minute or so of awkwardness asked us where we would like to sit, I think that is what he asked us because he was barely audible. We just kind of followed him back out to the patio where he seated us at the first table for two. We were still looking forward to our beer so we shook it off, NBD. We waited and waited, then a server said they would return with waters.  Another few long moments later our waiter dropped off some waters. They were in these fun glasses made with cut off liquor bottles...my hope returned for a good experience. Another wait...I promise you they were not busy, there was a sprinkle of people... unless they were stashed somewhere I could not see. When our waiter returned to take our order he was very short. He didn't exactly say ""what do you want?"" but it was along those lines. They have a very poor draft beer selection, but we will just chalk that up to being spoiled by nationally renowned SD craft beer, that can be found at nearly every watering hole in the city. The menu looked lovely, although not much for vegans and vegetarians. At this point we were not going to commit to a meal, so we ordered two of the only craft beers available and an order of fries to share. I'll try to wrap this up here...beer arrived flat, I mean FLAT! How did the bartender not notice? Fries were actually pretty damn good...some herby stuff on them, yum. We had no napkins or silverware, good thing we ordered finger food. We'll just wipe our hands on our pants I guess. We complained about the horribly flat beer, the waiter asked if we wanted something else instead. No, just the check. We had waited so long for a sip of gross brew, we just wanted to leave. He gave us the check with the beers on it. WTF? My bf inquired about the bill, the waiter said, ""I asked if you wanted me to take the beers off!"" Um, what? Why would that even need to be asked? He removed the beers and apologized and gave us some explanation for the flat beer. It was just too late, I just wanted to get out of there. I was so disappointed. We paid for our fries and left a little tip. It's hard stiffing a server even for bad service when you've been in the industry. I understand what it's like to be busy or spread a little thin, but no one even seem to care that we were there. I really wished this place would have turned out to be somewhere we liked to hang out...oh well.",Restaurant
BudflDI8KQGvqdQ-JNXYbw,XnBchAQ21OZU6ryeS3_arg,_z-8uqduKQSgue--QJU_Lw,2017-06-22,"It's hard for me to write this because I really think there's great potential here, but the artists haven't been tattooing as long as I thought. Some are still learning, and that's okay. They are very talented for the amount of time they've been tattooing when it comes to clean lines and vibrant colors, I really want to see them improve their craft and grow. But there are some things I want to be honest about so people don't make the same mistakes I made. My boyfriend & I take good care of all our ink and stay attentive throughout the healing process, because we respect an artist's time and work they put into it.

I was recommended this shop by an old high school acquaintance. Several acquaintances went here so I figured I'd follow their choice. They do beautiful designs and that's what got me hooked. I personally never had issues with healing when it came to Ashley, but my healing process was not normal with Joelle which I'll explain later. I love my small pieces, but my big custom pieces I wish I would have done more research with artist wise and had a lot more patience with. ""Cheap big piece? What have I got to lose."" I look at them and feel sad. I'm scared of going out in public and showing them off. They're great pieces, just wasn't what I originally imagined they would look like when finished I guess. As much as other people like them, I'm depressed. It's my fault for not being more thorough before it was on my skin though, I let the artist use their own creativity for the most part because they definitely have a category that suits them really well.

They have really open schedules, which I thought was great, but I feel like maybe it's because they're still new to the industry. I got so much ink done too quickly and I didn't realize the impulse until it was too late. Ashley originally told me to put aquaphor on day 1, I had no issues when I did this to each one. I was told to put lubriderm lotion on the tattoos day 1 with Joelle's. It had white\/yellow ooze from the thin layer applied, and became hard as a rock and crusty, with a yellow\/brown glossy tint for a little over a week. I couldn't move my arm for a few days that's how bad it hurt. Joelle insisted it was normal, but I really don't think it was after my boyfriend's experience. He wanted to get a logo on his calf and he also said it was the most painful tattoo he's gotten compared to another artist who tattooed his chest and spine. His other tattoo on the same calf by Ashley barely hurt him, no issues with healing. (Using aquaphor like I did day 1 instead.)

After he got his tattoo with Joelle, he couldn't walk for several days. He was literally crawling in pain that's how bad it was. Just like I couldn't move my arm for several days. He had the same healing reaction I did, but it started to break out with red dots all over it 2-3 weeks later. He went to the doctor and they said it was Staff infection and he had to take antibiotics and ointment to treat it. It took a few months for the redness to go away. He kept messaging Joelle and she never took responsibility for it. He put a thin layer of lubriderm on his tattoo day 1 like he was told. Another artist said it's too fresh to put lotion in the pores the first 2 days and it can get clogged, and the pores should be able to ""breathe."" He followed her healing process 100% correctly I can vouch for, cleaned with antibacterial soap everyday. HIS FOOT WAS LITERALLY SWOLLEN! He never covered it at night with a blanket, but Joelle said it's probably because he wore a sock, but the sock wasn't even near the tattoo. He stopped wearing socks, and things still weren't improving. He even bumped into her at a convention and she never said anything to him. The ink rejected around the discolored, hardened areas just like my ink in the same areas rejected. An artist at the convention said traditionally the face should be facing towards him and was backwards. 

That artist asked another artist, ""What's wrong besides the infection here?"" 
""Oh, it's backwards"" they said.

It just wasn't fair or acceptable. It's been about 5 months since this incident and he still has these weird bumps that will randomly form at times, and he says it sometimes gets itchy. It might be an allergic reaction to the ink, the bumps are really hard like stone almost. It's like it's in the tissue practically. I'm finally going to come out and say it so people are careful. I mean no harm writing this. There are artists here that are so talented and do amazing work, I can assure you. I'm just afraid this will continue to happen to other people unless they change something. They're just too heavy handed.",Beauty
GzWJWPu7MS5C90tByAtwpQ,IXknrPWlZ7OrkxZzZp1F6w,r0tkO_ekXqzy5SPwGVJ7mQ,2016-04-07,"This is the third time my partner and I came here in two weeks - the first time (St. Paddy's Day) was fantastic, the second time was okay, but the 3rd visit (April 1st) was disastrous.  The points below describes our third experience: 

Our drink order was taken about twenty minutes later, and it took an additional 25 minutes to receive the drinks.  Usually, drinks take about 5-10 minutes to arrive.  
        I made a comment that the drinks took too long.
            The waitress said she can credit my partner's, because he has to drive.
            I left mine on the side, but didn't drink it.
            Since the server seemed reluctant to make any adjustments on the bill, my cousin   drank my drink just before we left, and apparently it was not a good Long Island anyway.  (I should have known when the server said she was a bartender, and mentioned iced tea in a long island! - for non-long island drinkers, there should not be an ounce of tea in there.  The color is from cola.)
        
We received only 2 sets of cutlery for 3 people. 

 For some reason, the staff who bring the food never seemed to know where the meals would go.  They would go to the table closer to the door, and when they said no, then our food would find its way to us.  This happens occasionally at restaurants, but I've never seen it happen so many times.  And again, the place was NOT busy. 
    
We had to wait quite a while for a server (any server, not even ours) to come close enough to ask for ketchup.  When it was brought, it was nearly empty and definitely not enough for one person, let alone 3.
    
There were BONES in my fish and chips.  I accidentally swallowed one, and there was at least one more (I did show the waitress when she came to give us our bill, and she apologized).  I stopped eating it for fear of swallowing more bones, and did not finish my meal.

My cousin said the veggie burger was mediocre - not bad, but not great.
    
We were charged $1.99 for extra jalepenos.  When I told the waitress we never received the extra, she said she made the note in the computer.  I told her this was the normal amount, and she said that they included the extras between the nachos.  Like I said, the previous 2 nachos we ordered were loaded.  She made absolutely no effort to rectify the situation, but preferred to argue that the jalepenos were there (even though she did not bring the nachos, and therefore did not see them herself).
        
In addition, we were not informed that ""lots of jalepenos"" would be an extra charge.  Yes, it is only $2, but usually they would let us know it's an extra charge.  (I was informed by another waitress at another time at this same establishment that the tzaki was an extra charge, so I know it is not against restaurant policy to inform the customers of extra charges, but this waitress just did not seem to care.  We did get the tzaki, but it's just good practice to let your customers know when something will be an extra charge.)
    
When we requested to speak with a manager, the waitress returned and said he must have stepped out because they ran out of something.  She did offer to give us his phone number so we can discuss the issues over the phone, but she never made an attempt to actually give us the number.
    
Upon our departure, waitress made a comment something to the effect that she hopes this does not reflect her service.  Again, very unprofessional.  If you have an unhappy customer, you try to let them leave on a happier note, not deflect blame away from yourself.  And furthermore, f she was giving proper service, she would have came to check up on us more than once.

And please do not get me wrong, I extend the utmost respect and patience with servers.  Perhaps this one is new, or inexperienced, I am not sure.  But whatever the case is, the Fox and the Fiddle needs to spend more time training staff.  

Definitely will not go back and cannot recommend.  And also upset that we spent nearly $80 for this awful experience.  It's a shame, because based on my previous 2 experiences, we thought we found a gem close to home.",Restaurant

The resort is sprawling. It's nicely landscaped and nicely appointed. 

First we had difficulty just finding the entrance using our GPS. Don't park in any parking lots just keep driving around the miles long perimeter until you find the front hotel entry on Carnegie St.

The entry is beautiful (though don't look close at the details as everything is cheap fakes made to look nice -- but that suffices for me). 

In my case we were bumped up (at a cost of $200 additional per night) to the Tuscan Suite from a double queen room. However, in order to do that they had to move those guests (our children) to a different tower. That didn't work for us so we downgraded our second room from an Executive Suite (which we briefly checked into and I can say is definitely not worth any more than a standard room) to a double Queen.

The double Queen room was nice and in the East Tower overlooking the pool. But we were charged for an Executive Suite. On check out I was told that although the invoice was ""confusing, we were not charged for the suite"". However, when I arrived home and checked with the credit card charges I could see that we were indeed charged for the Executive Suite. 3 phone calls over the past 3 weeks each had the same result. ""A manager will call back, here is a confirmation number. No manager or anyone ever calls back. :(

The Tuscan Suite is dramatic to walk into and very nice. But really, with just 1 king bed I can't imagine the value of an 8 person dining room table and giant living room -- other than just gaudy fun, which we did appreciate! 

The 'Feast Buffet' was somewhere between OK and not OK. The food was not kept fresh or neat at the self serve stations. The food itself was more like poor quality cafeteria food. Each of us found something we could eat but it was not a pleasant meal. The smoke from the casino was too much for my kids in the buffet. Since we had free dinner and breakfast vouchers, we did eat there for both those meals.

Getting to anything other than the pool area (the food, movies, arcade, outdoor mall) requires going through the smokey casino. If you smoke it's no problem. If you don't and don't enjoy the smokey stench this isn't a great casino.

The pool area is just OK. The sand area is nice, I think, for young children (mine are teens and steered clear of all the little kids there). Definitely do NOT rent a cabana there -- I was quoted $350 for the day (no partial day rentals). They are hotter than just laying out under an umbrella, have poor service, and are inconvenient to the main pool.

Main problem with the pool is that the pool closes at 7 pm!!!  At 6:45pm I saw a family with 3 kids in swim suits carrying pool toys arrive in the lobby only to be told that while it was 100 degrees and sunny outside the pool was closing -- not for some unavoidable technical reason but as standard hotel policy. :\/ The kids were all whining and the father looked miserable. The pool security guard said that it was so the guests would spend money in the hotel and casino. If you plan on gambling while your spouse and\/or children enjoy the pool forget it. You will be having to find other entertainment for everyone. The outdoor mall shops are closed so it's the strip, downtown or to bed.

Getting around in the hotel is a hassle because it is so sprawling. Getting to our room took 2 separate elevator rides in two buildings. It limits what can be accomplished in a day when getting to and from the room is so cumbersome.

On our way back home we did stop at the M to get breakfast. That casino seemed worlds nicer and had no cigarette smell. That would be my next go to place if staying off strip.

At the Green Valley Ranch, the rooms were comfortable, the service friendly, the beds very comfortable, the pool and restaurants fair to poor.

As for being charged for an Executive Suite while receiving a standard double Queen room, well 3 unreturned calls is enough for me. If they are not interested in charging the correct amount, I just won't return. It's a matter of about $300. Something I'll remember before booking at a Station Casino again.",Beauty
q5mR7WJ_8xUBa27olWRlPw,6VVL-F5KqNSXzBTtiEHW_A,CP_2DNTqoCT_h_6r-9YJLA,2017-02-16,"So my mom bought me a Groupon for my birthday to get a massage. She found Moda Forte Boutique & Salon and bought a Groupon for $45 for a one-hour massage. When I called the salon to book my massage, I learned that the massage therapist had up and quit and moved to Las Vegas. Ok. Dead Groupon as my birthday prezy. So I debated whether or not to help my mom get the $$$ back she spent on the Groupon and find a new Groupon, or to see if I could use it to get my hair done by someone new. I don't love trying new hairdressers - I like the time tested ones, but I put myself out on a limb and thought - ok, let's do it.

I called and talked to the owner a couple of times. I have long blonde hair, so I was looking into a hair cut ($55) and full-highlights ($90). The home page of the website was offering a special for 50% off a hair-cut for new customers when you buy full highlights. I thought great, I'll apply what my mom spent on the Groupon to that. If you do the math $55x50% = $27.50. $27.50 + $90 for highlights = $117. $117 minus the $45 we spent for my Groupon would equal $72.50. Ok ladies - are you following me so far?

So the owner says, I'll tell you what, I'll just give you a free hair cut in lieu of your Groupon! I thought mmm, I guess, ok - but I hadn't taken the time to work out the math. That meant I pay $90, not $72.50 or actually $22.50 MORE than I should have paid. The Groupon value was $45 after all. I mean. I could have cancelled the damn Groupon, got the $45 cash from my mom, taken up the 50% off haircut offer plus the $90 for highlights and used my own money from the Groupon credit to pay $22.50 LESS than what they charged me. Argh. I hate that kind of nickel and dime bullshit.

So I get sold on spending more money than I intended. Not a great way to make a first impression. (FACT: Did you know it takes 7 seconds to make a first impression and SEVEN in person meetings to overcome a first impression). You just bummed out a potentially great new client.

Anyway, I get to assigned Morgan to do my hair and we talked about what I wanted\/needed, what's worked for me in the past, etc. She was nice enough. Young, but confident in what she was doing. So after spending a couple hours doing my highlights she tells me I need toner. And I'm like, well why? To take out the brassy highlights, she tells me. I'm a little confused by this and tell her I've had bad experiences with over-toning in the past and having my hair come out dull looking. She says no, you really need it. Oh, Ok. I'll admit it. I'm vain - I want my hair to look devastatingly beautiful when I exit a hair salon. And while I'm picky about how I budget (what smart woman isn't) I'm willing to pay for a great look. Afterall, if you're going to spend hours and hours in the salon to get your hair done - who wouldn't want to walk out feeling more gorgeous than when you walk in? So I say hesitatingly say Yes to the toner. Only Morgan doesn't tell me that the 10-minute toner she put on my head would cost me an additional FORTY BUCKS! - WAIT...WHOA....WHAT? I mean WTF? You already ripped me off half the value of my Groupon, now you're gonna charge me $40 without telling me? Two hours for full-highlights for $90, and then an extra $40+ for 10-minute toner. And zero communication that this service would cost me an extra 50% more than what I was quoted to spend. That my friends is not how you run a salon.

Look salon people, I'm sure you want happy new long-term customers that are going to refer you to more happy new long-term customers. This is how you stay a profitable business. But this my friends - THIS is NOT the way to treat a new customer. 

And you're f'ng lucky I didn't give you a one rating. Because I felt like it for leaving feeling ripped off. But at the end of the day, when I walked out - my hair looked beautiful. Morgan did a fabulous job. For that, I might've even given your salon a 5-star glowing review. 

But I didn't - because when I left your salon and walked out, I felt I had been a victim of bait and switch advertising and had the sour taste in my mouth of feeling ripped-off and cheated. By the way - you owe me the other $22.50 for the value of the Groupon! You can go ahead and call me and give me back that money you owe me on my credit card.

And for anyone considering trying this salon - get the used-car salesman at the front desk to be straight with you about what your services are going to cost. Nickel and diming your new customers is not how you win business.  You just lost what might have been an amazing long-term client.",Beauty
fDQnHJAB2q9JiH9PS4qbTA,xUhKi3p2BRTEbTHtJz-Hhg,uCH0CNiQ1fXzKUjgoCOC2Q,2015-01-20,"I've now been here 3 times, and despite the first two times being quite lovely, I can honestly say today was the worst salon experience of my life - I honestly don't know if I can ever feel safe going to any salon again.
First, let me explain the first two visits. First time here was back in December. My BFF and I went for a manicure. My nails were a little short, but I went anyway. The lady talked me into a full set -the first I've ever had in my life. I really can't do long nails because I type too much in my job, but the guy listened to me and only did a small extension, just so they had more to color. I personally felt that he sanded my nails a little to thin, but the end result was so perfect and lovely! I couldn't stop smiling. 
Never having had a full set before, I did my research. I cared for them, card for my cuticles, and three weeks later went in for a polish change and a fill. Again, lovely job. At first, I had to remind the girl that they needed trimming, they were getting too long for me and my job, but she assured me she would sand them down, and she did. Perfect job, even better than before.
Then came today. You see, at this point, my extensions were almost grown out... Turn my hands upsidedown and you could see them. I was afraid if they got sanded again, they might crack, and... Also, I liked having the extra strength of the extra extension. I knew a fill would leave me with mostly natural nail that would be technically thin and potentially weak. But I've never done this - when DO you get a new set instead of a fill? According to WebMD, after six weeks, you should get a new extension put on, but they said they should be soaked off, never EVER torn or chipped off, as that pulls your natural nail more. Okay, sounded good, in I went, again with my BFF.
They first sat me with a young guy. I explained what I wanted, a new set, and he looked at me like I was crazy. ""These are fakes?"" Yes, I said, but I was due for a new set, just a short one please. ""You mean a fill?""  Uh, no. New set...? Isn't that a thing? My natural nail isn't so strong, and the extensions are almost grown out. Young guy talks in Chinese (I think) to another guy, the same one who first put my set. Even he looks baffled by this request, but says he'll do it and give me a new set. When they switch, the shift manager lady comes over and tells at him in Chinese. He apologized, stated he had an appointment and couldn't do mine, so the young man and him trade back. The Lady says something in Chinese to the young guy, and he starts again. 
Then the lady sets the other guy at the station next to us... With my BFF. Um... We both walked in together. What about his ""appointment""?
So, thus began the most painful nail experience ever. Young guy did not listen to me. I asked him to please soak off the nails. He said ""Okay"", but then proceeded to use a random extension piece to RIP OFF MY ACRILYCS! ""Tell me if it hurts,"" he says as he shoves the plastic between the acrylics and my nails. EACH TIME I told him it hurt, asked him to soak them, please, and he would say ""Okay,"" but then rip off another nail. I yelped every time. When he finished, my poor nails were in sheds!! ""Forget the extensions,"" I said in stunned shock, ""Just clean these up and put on a color, please. They're too thin, and it scares me."" He and the other guy doing my friend's nails both say, no, the new set will cover them and fix them. I'm numb, terrified, and just absently agreed. They are nail techs, right? They know how to fix these things. I should relax and trust them.
Wrong. The young guy proceeded to give me extensions, but again refused to listen to me when I said they were to long. He kept saying he would ""get it"", but never did. Long and uneven. I told him again they were TOO LONG and he proceeded to file them roughly by hand, essentially beating my already sore and hurting nails - and he didn't even file them straight!! Square corners, round corners, and my left middle finger nail was literally pointing to the left, as he kept filing the right side of it. He slapped polish on it and... Some sort of top coat, but it wasn't even shiny. My fingers were swollen, bruised, and throbbing as he quickly gave me an awkward arm lotion massage (didn't even put lotion on a few of my fingers), gave me a ticket, and I was rushed to the front desk. 
I was in such shock - I kid you not, numb shock - I didn't know what to say. The manager rang me up, but they young guy was right there watching. I paid and left, sobbing with my friend on the way home. In a weird way, I felt violated. They ripped my nails off and gave me a hideous manicure that was not what I asked for. I got the courage to call the manager (who they first said was out, and wouldn't be back until Wednesday, but who then called me back). He first said they don't soak nails off because customers don't want them soaked, and they charge extra for it. I explained I asked for the soak, but he ripped off my nails anyway",Shopping
35Nk5En2FCVr8pkc5ljM9A,GF_BSqaNu69aKn0AR_M9Wg,StzhG702lMPU_1Z7XZgxSg,2013-06-16,"I was really excited to try Carefree Station, as I love Carefree and that type of atmosphere. We went with friends who said their bunch was very good. The outside patio seemed lovely, and we sat inside. It smelled a little bit walking in (pee-ish), but no biggie. I was excited to meet our friends and try the breakfast\/brunch. The waitress asked us if there were any questions about the menu. My boyfriend asked what they were known for and she said..""well....food."" I asked if there was any way to get the french toast without the stuffing. She said no, what is on the menu is what you get. This is not ""that"" type of restaurant. So, it came time to order. I am admittedly very picky, and I have some food allergies\/sensitivities, which is why I order things very plain. That doesn't mean I don't like to try new places and things, or that I don't love food as much as everyone else. I had looked at the menu and had found everything too ""much"" for me, so I asked if I could order the Crepes just completely plain. Not extra, not complicated, just a plain crepe. Something that is actually 10x easier to make then some stuffed, elaborate item. She told me she really didn't think that was possible, and that this was a private restaurant, not a ""corporate"" restaurant, and you can't just ask for everything customized. In my mind, I am thinking...I rarely go to chains, I frequent private restaurants all the time - from hole in the wall to the most expensive in the valley. No one ever makes such a big deal out of making me something simple. 

Anyhow, she says she needs to go check, and instead brings another ""senior"" waitress over and asks me to repeat what I had asked for - like it was some sort of blasphemous crazy order that she can't repeat. I said ""I would like a plain Crepe with nothing on it if possible"" - the next waitress says ""what do you mean a plain Crepe"" and I clarified. They both stood there making a huge deal about it, saying how the Chef and owner would be horrified to hear this and they would get written up if they put that order in, but that they ""guess"" they could go back and fall on the sword for me and check. They kept blaming the owner. SO EMBARRASSING for me at this point, they are making such a big deal out of it. She comes back and says it is ok, and the other waitress says to her are you sure? She says yes. Then, I commit the horrible offense of asking for a side of fruit. She steps back and stares me down, and then says that maybe I should just go up to Albertsons! ARE. YOU. KIDDING. ME. I had been extremely nice until this point, and at that I said ""I've never been to a breakfast restaurant in the country that won't serve you a side of fruit"" and she then agreed to bring it to me. When my Crepe came, it had the fruit on top of it, just kind of like an extra ""f-you."" They also made a big deal out of one of our friends asking for onions to be left out of his burrito. Throughout our whole meal you could see the two waitresses telling other waiters of my order, with people staring. 

This is not the review of a crazy angry person. I am typically very positive and understanding. You can see that I have a ton of 5-star reviews. But this was just ridiculous. They made me feel embarrassed, like a child. I am a nice, polite grown woman looking to order a plain Crepe. I'm making less work for you, and you get to make a crepe and charge me $13. If you have that much of a problem with it (which I still think would be silly), politely tell me that is not available. 

The crepe was actually very good. My boyfriend's burger was ""ok."" I will never go back, and would recommend others avoid. I have some great breakfast\/brunch recommendations if you'd like! The friends who took us there were mortified and apologized for bringing us there multiple times.",Restaurant
eK3cplZih2tyygUpDsmk8g,ZRb3I6biU1CKAouktK4Buw,lhMtAxnj9layxrjnDy06gw,2013-08-22,"I came here 3 times and here is my cumulative review of the place.

I got a groupon for some type of eyelash extensions for cheap at Orya that I thought I'd try out. Christina did them for me and I was surprised that she was done in about 10 minutes time. These extensions were nice for the price though I should know by now that nothing is what it seems with those groupon\/teambuy vouchers. That went fair and all was well.

While getting my extensions done Christina said one phrase that I will never forget for the rest of my life, ""they call me the eyebrow lady in Toronto"". Wow! That's a tall order! Noticing that she had symmetrical and full shaped arches I scheduled an appointment to come see her closer to an event I had to go to. 

When I came back for my eyebrows I was very nervous, this was the first time I had them done by anyone in over a decade. It was raining outside, I was sweaty, we had one of those humid yet rainy days and I felt so frazzled coming from a different direction than before with the TTC.

Christina brings me back to the same room where I had my eyelash extensions done and tells me to lay down on her table. She then tells me to lift the skin above my brow, I guess to make it taut? I was grossed out by doing this as I didn't even get the chance to wash my hands upon arriving. I think I may have asked for a tissue to use with my fingers, I don't remember. Christina starts threading away and the pain is tolerable but I notice she's going into 'no thread zones' on my face, meaning, hair was being taken out of areas that felt like they shouldn't have been. Maybe I just don't know any better I think to myself.

After she was done threading she tinted my brows. I wanted them a little bit darker, not a lot, as I had very light golden blonde hair and a very fair complexion. I was excited about this part as it meant I wouldn't need to fill them in like I normally do. She left me in that room all by myself for about 10 minutes and came to check up on me afterwards. I got up off the table and Christina handed me a mirror to let me see. WOW were they EVER dark, they looked like they were tattooed on (should have checked up on me sooner!!). The shape of my brows looked very canned: nothing was natural about them, it was just two lines with an arch, not to mention the space between my brows was considerably wider (that's the 'no thread zone' I was referring to earlier). Usually brows are supposed to start right along each side of your nose, but with these brows they were noticeably more indented in. I decided maybe I need to give this shape a chance despite it not feeling like it compliments my face shape at all, and the brow colour I was reassured would fade away by the next day because the dye on the skin would go away. I paid $60 for this, not knowing that this is considered an exorbitant amount for eyebrows.

I decided I'd give Christina one last try a couple months later. I came back and specifically told her I don't want anything taken off, just to clean them up (it was maintenance at that point). The same thing: lay down on the table, lift the skin above your brows up, and away she goes with the threading. I got them slightly tinted again but afterwards when everything was done I was MORTIFIED. I don't know if I can attach a picture of my brows here, but I would like to upload an image to show you just how awful these brows turned out. Simply put, one brow was significantly smaller than the other and it was over-threaded from the bottom, meaning one arch was more pointier than the other because there was more hair taken out. I noticed this right away and looked into her big mirror and said, ""They're uneven"". She replied in a tone that was trying to cover up denial so badly: ""They look fine to me"". REALLY?! This is what you say to a customer that isn't happy?! Because YOU think they're fine then I should be happy with them, whose brows are they again!? Who's going to take me seriously with these eyebrows?! 

I told her I can't go out with eyebrows like this and that they need to be fixed. So she takes a tweezer and starts tweezing the arch of the smaller eyebrow! She was clueless, CLUELESS! It was after this visit that I realized she probably learned how to thread eyebrows into one specific shape and that's what she sticks with. I have come to this conclusion because she doesn't take the time to ask you what sort of brows you have and would like to have, it's like I always had to hold off on her beginning to tell her my wants, even though they were blatantly ignored. Furthermore, she threads brows upside down, meaning she stands over my head when she threads so my eyebrows look upside down to her. She never once looked over the other way to see how she was doing for evenness.

I didn't tip and had to grow my brows out for a year before tweezing again.

I guess when Christina said she was 'the eyebrow lady of Toronto', she forgot to add 'WORST' in the phrase. Never again. Just no.",Beauty
sRO7bgVufMqSInBK7C96CA,Si6CDh3AIT5hrsqYFebLLw,OjApDLQUPV8c_yPCg8xZog,2015-07-11,"Took the family out to Vegas for 4th of July weekend, and prior to heading out to Vegas had heard about this place from Yelp reviews. Much to my surprise, we didn't need reservations. When we got to the restaurant, it appeared very busy on Friday evening (July 3rd). The lovely Maître D'\/Hostess at the entrance asked if we had reservations (we didn't), she said no problem and found us a table quickly. They have both regular tables and high tables\/high chairs. I personally prefer high tables, and was glad to have got seated accordingly.

Shortly after being seated, our waiter, Kristen B., approached our table to take the drinks\/appetizers order. We ordered lemonades all around, and a Georgia Margarita. Personally, I'm not a fan of Lemonades that are overly-sweet. Thank GOD the Lemonade here was just right as far as sweetness goes. My parents decided they wanted to try the Smoked Wings appetizer. They aren't really into the whole 'wings' thing, as they're old school, but let me tell you, between both of them, they made quick work of those damned smoked wings LOL. So much so, that they got full just off of them, and they passed on entrees.

As far as entrees, we ordered a half-order of Smoked Chicken, a full rack of Mopped Baby Back Ribs, a half-order of Beef Brisket, and 2 orders of Corn Bread! Oh yeah, we came HUNGRY and ready to eat LMAO! 

It took a while for the order to be brought out, which is understandable considering it was a busy Friday evening on a holiday weekend. We didn't mind waiting, because I knew everything we ordered was being made-to-order, and not sitting under a heat lamp (Main reason we came here.) When the gentleman came out with our food, I was surprised at the servings -- I mean they didn't cut corners on anything. The full rack of ribs had over 12 ribs, and the half chicken was a very generous serving. 

The Baby Back ribs were very delicious, and it definitely helped that they provide you with extra sauce to drench all over your ribs with. Some places have ribs where the meat feels very rubbery, not here. The meat was very tender and the smoke on them was just right, not overbearing, as well as the seasoning being spot-on. You can tell that the people they have working in the kitchen know their BBQ. 

The Smoked Chicken was very very juicy, and again, the smoking on it was spot on, not over bearing like at some other places we've been to, and seasoned well. The damned corn bread was so good, we had to order a 2nd serving of it. It's put into the oven upon ordering, and so what you get are three biscuit-style pieces of corn bred, which paired with their honey butter are extremely ADDICTING! If you're on a diet, you better make this your cheat meal of the week LOL

Only one other place I've been to has had Brisket this good (Fat Matt's Ribs down in Atlanta). Again, here you can tell that the folks at PLC know their brisket and they know how to slow-cook their Texas-Style Brisket. I'm talking about Brisket you put in your mouth and it just melts inside your mouth like it was butter -- That Good!

Two of us couldn't do all this food justice (The parents themselves got full with their appetizer, leaving 2 of us to consume the entrees), so we had to take some ribs\/chicken back to our hotel (Too bad our hotel didn't have a microwave, but late night wings\/ribs after a night of clubbing hits the spot just good!). 

Being Las Vegas, a place with infinite dining options, it is truly a foodie city. What can separate one establishment from the next is not only the quality of the food, but most importantly (to me), the level of professionalism of the staff. I must say that Kristen B, and the gentleman who's name escapes me right now, made the visit very welcoming and pleasurable. Very attentive to our needs (we had a toddler with us, Kristen brought her a lemonade diluted w\/ half water), and always making sure to ask if we were enjoying our meal. Very great dinner service with a highly attentive staff. You can't go wrong with Pot Liquor CAS.

I will be returning in September with some friends for the UCLA\/UNLV football game weekend! This is definitely on the to-do list everytime we hit Vegas!",Restaurant
h7N01hOm4iVQrrK79Z5BNw,W6CrBiuPNADGDIH_m39_aw,v_LG5tOinxf3ve5GAIZhjQ,2017-05-01,"Fancy a cheeky Nando's with a pint or a cuppa, mate? Or maybe the Coke Freestyle Machine, choose from Coke or Diet Coke, Powerade, Minute Maid Lemonade or Dasani. Now choose your fruit flavour & will that be caffeine free. Oh yeah. Pop is bottomless for $2.75. Now the peri-peri chicken plate: Daughter and I chose a medium sauce variety share plate, well worth it at $29.75. OMG! 2 succulent chicken skewers nicely spiced, we each had one and I shared a bite of mine cause it was so good, with hubby, 1\/2 chicken with the medium peri-peri sauce, plus 5 wings. 

It comes with 2 sides. We chose to share the Casa Salad & garlic mashed potatoes. The salad dressings are Creamy or Balsamic Vinegarette, Olive Oil or Classic bottles at the cutlery counter, help yourself. The little salad was exceptionally fresh, good quality cucumbers (daughter scarfed them ALL but said apologetically that they were VERY good!) cherry tomatoes, (they popped in my mouth, so fresh!) and crunchy romaine lettuce. The garlic mashed redskin potatoes were really well spiced. 

What I'm trying to say is that although you might want to grate some fresh pepper onto your meal, particularly the salad or chicken breast, you really don't miss using the salt around here. If you do want salt though, it's cunningly hidden in a little wooden egg shaker (yes, it's an egg) right next to the little Portuguese rooster who has your table number and who will hold his place until the waitress has brought over your hot meal.

Daughter scarfed the leg WAAAH! But with the extra Peri Peri sauce bottle, even the dryer white meat was quite good. If you are not sure of how spicy the peri peri sauce will be but feel brave, follow my plan: order the medium sauce on your chicken but pick up the Hot or Extra Hot Nando's peri-peri sauce bottle to shake onto your food from their serving counter, where the cutlery (real metal cutlery, none of that plastic crap) and Coke Freestyle Machine is located (this will the first time using that machine with Real Glass Tumblers!).

Lotsa dessert choices too but we went for the bottomless yogurt, which may be chocolate, vanilla or strawberry depending on what day you come in a  little cup you refill yourself at the yogurt machine. It's very similar to a Wendy's Frosty, except that like everything else it's NOT served in paper or plastic but on nice matching oven to table ware. This is the first restaurant I ever was tempted to take a photo of their DISHES, so I did!

Lastly, the ambience and the music: the ambience is red brickwork and comfortably designed chairs and rounded booths and regular booths, nice window looking onto THE Danforth. Music, a little different from what you've heard lately, Angolan from South Africa & Portuguese music. It was nice and added to the atmosphere.

Washrooms brand new, spotless and very spacious. Service, although Nando's is partially self service, for your drinks, cutlery & straws, and you order your chicken, sides & dessert, and receive your GLASS drinking glasses at the front counter, three waitresses asked if we'd been attended to while the first one was cleaning off the window facing table I'd requested was clearing it off. Two checked how we were doing and if we needed anything. Nando's hasn't missed a trick, Yelpers. Perfect on all counts, and this is Ms. Nitpicker speaking LOL!

Oh, Swiss Chalet, you are in DEEP TROUBLE if I am any judge, if this Nando's chain gets up and running in Toronto! Not even your own peri peri sauce will help!",Restaurant
F8KD2TD1oxxgJrkcHb_9OQ,TCPLaprJm4FFei2DkW6K6g,Kq2fw7SAKOLOmiJyVCbeFA,2016-01-01,"We've always been huge fans of Preston's sister restaurant, Arrowhead Grill. Unfortunately, since they were booked up for New Year's Eve, we decided to head over to Scottsdale and give Preston's a try. We assumed that the experience would be equivalent.

If you're familiar with Arrowhead Grill, you'll find that the menu at Preston's Steakhouse is very similar in terms of what they offer. Many of the entrees and sides are identical, including a few unique additions, such as their red velvet variation on AG's signature butter cake.

I was initially surprised that Preston's only has a 3.5 star average, with most people citing poor customer service as their main issue. Unfortunately, it didn't take us very long to realize that these reviewers were spot-on.

I'll start with the good:

Our server was very friendly and the food itself was excellent. I wouldn't expect anything less. The Delmonico steak has always been one of my favorite cuts of meat, with superb artisan mac and cheese and Yukon gold mashed potatoes as great side additions. Although admittedly, I was a little disappointed that the far, far superior cheese and bacon infused mashed potatoes found on their AG menu were conspicuously absent.  

I also saw many parties ordering their amazing butter cake for dessert. Although we didn't order the original version at this location, I can assure you that it's, without a doubt, something that everyone must try at least once.

Now, for the bad:

Preston's is in a much larger space than AG, which includes multiple rooms, fireplaces, and a second floor patio. When crowded, the place can get extremely loud and could desperately use some type of sound paneling treatment. We could barely have a conversation. The place just seemed way too noisy and frantic for a fine-dining atmosphere, which we've never found to be an issue at Arrowhead.

What's up with serving sodas in miniature aluminum bottles in an upscale restaurant? It's a cheap tactic that allows them to get away with charging for refills - and the soda only fills 3\/4 of the glass! You want more? Then you'll get double-charged! Seriously?

When we were seated at our table, my girlfriend thought something was odd about her chair. It wasn't until 15 minutes had passed that a bus boy did a double-take, mumbling something to her, while then reaching behind her back and dramatically yanking out a giant server tray that was somehow lodged between her back and the chair's backrest. It's as if he were performing some type of magic trick. Why was there a tray lodged in her chair? No idea. But the bus boy deserves credit for noticing something that everyone else (including us) failed to catch. 

The complimentary basket of bread that is always served BEFORE the meal took forever to come out. In fact, after 40 minutes, we had to flag down our server and request the bread. It was finally delivered to us, while our food was brought out literally seconds after. That's not the way it's supposed to be done. 

We decided to try their red velvet variation of their classic butter cake, as we knew it's unlikely that we'd ever return to this location again. It ended up tasting like regular red velvet cake, as the velvet completely overtakes the buttery flavoring that makes the original so great. My advice: stick to the regular one. I can at least confidently vouch for it!

While the food here is very good, I agree with other reviews who say they lack in customer service. The place just seemed very disorganized and lacking in efficiency, which probably isn't going to go over well with the clientele in this area.  

We'll always love Arrowhead Grill for their food quality and excellent customer service, but Preston's has way too many issues to warrant a repeat visit.

A forgotten, costumed criminal is truly the owner of this restaurant. His motif of joyously exploding triangles can be found all over the dining room. Gourmet food must be a more lucrative business these days than supervilliany. Hey, eats this good could turn The Kingpin into a harmless bon viviant. 

I know that the Deep Fried Gnocchi transformed me from a grumpy Hulk (it was a long, pissy day at the asylum) into a content, well-adjusted Bruce Banner on a date with Betty Ross. 

Deep Fried Gnocchi: It might sound unusual, and perhaps it is, which is why it works. You'd think they'd be doughy, crispy, but instead they just evaporate in your maw, almost as if they're imaginary, made not by flour and eggs, but wishes and dreams, the tart, chunky marinara only enhancing what is a small castle in the air of an appetizer. 

The Kaleidoscope Dip was too good of a read on the bill of fare to pass on, so we almost ordered it in addition to the gnocchi, but our exemplary server regretted to inform us that they had sold out of it that day. 

Onto another titular dish, the Kaleidoscope Salad. Lavishly leafy spinach starred along with bacon particles, avocado bits, tomato, sweetly roasted corn, and a postively tropical, zesty cilantro citrus vinaigrette in a feature so satisfying, I almost didn't feel I that needed a main course. There's something oxymoronic about such a salad with its salty, greasy bacon, the lardy avocado, and the 
healthful spinach. something that defeats the purpose, yet the salad all adds up to a sum greater than its parts. 
 
Compliments from the chef came a gaggle of toasted pita triangles (there's that theme again...) with a cherry-lemon butter that melted sacchariferously, acerbically, wondrously onto the sultry bread. Was this a ruse or an olive branch?

Timed perfectly, the Scallops Beurre Noisette came to our table, its cauterized scallops lying seductively, shivering with antici...pation on a bed of Klaus Nomi-worthy farfalle pasta (do. not. call. it. 'bow-tie.' I satirize the food snobs...). Toasted walnuts, diced tomatoes, and a brown butter sauce hang around in the periphery to make the entree all the more gustatorily interesting, one that would have been woodsy, humble, if not for those sensuous scallops that were so juicy and flavorful, I tried in vain to save them for last, resisting the urge to eat each of them whole. 

Kay had The Cow Jumped over the Blue Moon. As whimsical as it is sharp on the taste buds, this dish was made up of lasciviously tender beef slices, ideally al dente fettucini, a powerhouse Gorgonzola cream sauce, and a candy-coated onion confit that acted as a welcome contrast to the biting nature of the cheese.

For dessert I had the Flourless Chocolate Torte, Kay had a Lemon Rosemary Tart, and halfway through each one, we switched! The torte was absolutely possessed by an evil spirt of some kind that I suspect may have been rum. Nonetheless, it was rich and celebrative of cocoa. Surprisingly, being a chocolate addict, I liked the Lemon Rosemary Tart even more for its sunny, somewhat arcane palatableness and delightfully thick, cookie-like crust. 

After our meal, we encountered Kommander Kaliedoscope himself. He attemped to fire fractal missiles at us only for us to richochet some of them upward with shields we had hidden on our persons. One piece of shrapnel cut loose a strange sculpture that was hanging from the ceiling, directly above KK. It fell on top of him, rendering him immobile. 

""Please spare me. I'm just trying to make an honest living. Why can't you hero types leave me be?""

""Do you promise to go on the straight and narrow?"" Kay acted as interrogator. 

""Yes. I...had some parking tickets. I thought you were comin' after me.""

Kay and I looked at each other. 

""No, we just came for dinner,"" I reassured him, pulling the structure off of his gaudily costumed body, ""I apologize.""

""In that case, stay awhile, have some wine."" And thus ended our LoLa adventure. 

I kid, kid.  I'm not suffering from comic book delusions. We did speak with the owner upon leaving, however. A gracious fellow he was.

Like the cylindrical toy it takes its name from, Kaliedoscope Cafe has injected a dram of amusement, color, and life into this slumbering part of the neighborhood. Frequent this establishment, frequently, for they take food and twist it around for you to experience in all its beautiful forms through both your eyes and palate.

ciYdVYad3igZBYou-oWjoA,XQ-kvSPLSBPiivNpt9GyuQ,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,2013-09-30,"Let me first start off by saying that we are huge Michael Mina fans. We were absolutely in love with Sea Blue (every year we looked forward to a Las Vegas trip simply because of Sea Blue - The Chilean Sea Bass dish... when your lady friend is obsessed with a certain dish, you know it's THAT good!).

Michael Mina also owned Knobhill Tavern... had one of the best meals of my life there 2 years ago. I remember we even ordered seconds on a full belly. YUM!

Unfortunately Sea Blue has now been replaced with Pub 1842. We were extremely excited to try this pub, and even made reservations months before. But, that's pretty much where the excitement wore off; This place was one of the worst dining experiences we've all had, not just in Vegas.

First off, the table taps looked pretty sweet, but right out of the gate they were out of Weihenstephaner.

For starters we went with some Homemade Frickles, Hot Salted Pretzels with 'Merican beer cheese, poached egg, and an order of Duck Spring Rolls.

Our Frickles were extremely bland and no one wanted to finish them. At least they were hot, as our order of Pretzels and Spring Rolls were cold. After we sent them back, we didn't get a poached egg in the cheese when they returned with a new one. Since they were kind of hot, well, lukewarm I'd say, we just shrugged it off. The Spring Rolls were bland as well, but that was only the beginning.

For our main entrees, not one person out of the group of six enjoyed theirs.

The Wedge Salad featured huge, undercooked, fatty bacon that ended up lining the edges of the bowl. Even a waitress was hard pressed not to notice.

The Mac & Cheese was bland and had too much black truffle. When I was younger I use to think, 'How can you screw up a Mac & Cheese?' but in my years I've grown to know that it's the simple dishes that are hard to execute and easy to muck up. Even in a group of 6, we barely ate half of it, and left the rest.

After seeing the bacon that accompanied the Wedge salad, we were quite scared at what The Smoked Bacon Burgers would look like. Both of them came out extremely rare after they were ordered as medium rare. Another send back. Fries? Just ok. Lukewarm at best.

The Heritage Turkey Burger had so much lettuce on it while The Smoked Bacon Burgers had so little, we all joked that the Turkey Burger ran off with their lettuce. Half of the Turkey Burger was left. Doggie Bag? Ya, right.

As it stands, we left the best for last: Magical Mushrooms. The faces each of us made after trying a bite of these was priceless. The Mushrooms had a really foul after taste and almost tasted of burnt meat. Obviously they were extremely overcooked, and it was hard to pinpoint the angle Pub 1842 was going for these. I would have been much happier with some awesome salted, buttery, and fresh herb mushrooms rather than whatever these 'Magical' Mushrooms were put out to be. They were so bad that we had to tell the waitress of how foul they tasted. No joke, all six of us spit them up into our napkins. A sight to behold.

Even our pickles were past their expirations and just plain uneatable.

Our waitress was super nice, but her attitude completely changed after we sent back some of the items. Since we were in a group of six and had to catch the hockey game after (FROZEN FURY!), we really tried our hardest to stomach most of the dishes since we wouldn't have time to eat anything else before the drop of the puck.

Once the time came for the check, the waitress dropped it on the table and literally ran the other direction without making eye contact or saying a word. It was quite clear that she wanted to move on past this experience with a blind eye. I have to admit, so did we.

What started out really bad, ended even worse. We all hated the food so much that you couldn't convince any of us to come back, even for a free meal.",Restaurant

I know, a very different and cool assignment to visit a museum for school work, hahaha. It was great because I've never been to the ROM before, it was a good opportunity for me to visit it (finally!!!). I went to the ROM on a Saturday and I took the public transportation there and you would have to stop at Museum station on the Yonge-University line.

With appropriate signage, I managed to easily find my way to the ROM from the subway station. And of course I had to take pictures of the iconic ROM! This exterior of the ROM visualizes a crystal and it's so bloody beautiful... Definitely an iconic structure in Toronto, in my eyes.

Attained my complimentary ticket and went in!
I wasn't satisfied with the service at the counter or admissions though. The guy at the counter was nice but was fumbling when trying to scratch off my name off the school's list... The girl at admissions barely smiled or said a word to me while scanning my ticket. Was totally bizzare.. not even a smile. Her job was sitting on a chair, scanning the tickets and she couldn't even say something or smile? Jeez.

Moving on.

The guy at the information desk though, Peter was his name, a much older grandpa-like figure, was super helpful and even gave suggestions on how I should explore the museum since it was my first time! He was really nice, A++.
Peter suggested that I should start from the top of the museum and make my way down from there. Soooo that's what I did!

On the 4th Floor was the Speciality Exhibit - Viva La Mexico! Showcased of the culture - focusing more of their outfits, methods, patterns and materials used for their clothings and rugs.

Down the stairs from Level 4 to Level 3, here is this mini display of toys behind the glass.
You can see the aging in the toy soldiers as their colour fades off and a few scrap marks here and there. Not much of a description talking about this - but I still found it pretty cool.

Level 3 was a combination of Africa\/Middle Eastern and South Asian culture - I believe. There was tons of miniature temples, statues of Buddha, showing the materials used in the temples or doors in the houses and patterns of the tiles. The huge fish is actually a fish coffin based on the culture and traditions from Ghana.

This was the mini gallery of from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor's Biodiversity gallery. It was highlighting insects, butterflies, shells and other fossils~

On 2nd floor's Diversity, the entrance artwork really stood out compared to other floors. I'm assuming it's popular among ages since it was all dinosaurs~ and another side of this floor was biodiversity - animals, plants, live fish tank! Capturing the overall harmony of Earth.
There was also a kid's play area in the Biodiversity section, so expect lots of running kids.

The 1st floor was dedicated towards the other half of Asia - so like China, Japan and Korea exhibits of walls, patterns, scriptures, re-occurring themes within each country.

On the 1st Floor, if you go through some stairs down to the basement, there is actually a restaurant that similarly resembles IKEA's style of getting and ordering food. The route wasn't quite noticeable... so be on the look out!

They had options of pasta, rice, drinks, coffee\/tea, pastries, dessert like these cute dinosaur cookies shown below! I'm quite skeptic of eating the food that are left in the open as I saw some school kids touching it and putting it back... Yeeeeep. Plus, the prices are kinda pricey, in my broke student opinion. There's tons of options to eat outside before you head into the ROM or after you finished. If you bring your own food, there is also a canteen in a secluded spot of the museum that you can eat there.

Overall, as a first timer, I had a great time at the ROM - Bonus because it was a free ticket. I rushed the floors to get my assignment done, but it still took like 2 -3 hours to cover the entire building. You can basically spend the entire day here, if you took your time here. I'm not sure if I'll be back again though.

I think this is a nice area to go for a date as well - more towards couples date than a friends date, personally because I wouldn't go to museums with my friends. However, if you're a post-secondary student, you can go to the ROM for free! But you must present your student ID card, of course. There is also discounted Fridays starting from 430PM, so if you want, it can be a fun Friday night in the museum!

I went here about 2 months ago, and now they have a new exhibit called Tattoos - which I think will be more interesting than the one I went to which was Viva La Mexico. Personal preference. Don't forget to bring your camera, I went crazy snapping photos!",Shopping

So before Christmas of last year, my mom and I were looking into getting our nails done. My mom isn't much of a manicure person, but she wanted to have nice nails because she was going to a lot of parties that year. Red Persimmon nails is close to our house, so we stopped by to see their prices and saw a sign on the window that said gel manicures $20. I was excited because I wanted a gel manicure and I had never seen it that cheap, and even my mom decided to get a gel manicure because the price was so good.
We went in and told them that we wanted a gel manicure, and I pointed out to the sign on the door. They told us to pick our colors and then sat us down. They have a good array of colors, and the colors we picked were gorgeous, and the women who did our nails were fabulous. They were very gentle with me which was nice because the few different gel manicures I had gotten in the past had been done by very rough nail artists. The manicure was very clean and the color was thin, to the point where it looked like normal polish instead of thick gel polish, but it still had the glossiness of gel polish. We go to pay and they tell us that it will be $70.
We're surprised and asked them about the sign, and they say that that promotion is only for the color, not for the whole manicure like clipping cuticles and the hand massage. We're both angry because of this, because a normal manicure with all of those things and normal polish is $12, but when you add that stuff to the $20 gel polish, it's suddenly $15? My mom and I are giving each other uncomfortable looks and being very obvious about the fact that we were caught off guard and not very pleased about the extra $30 we have to spend, and the guy just stood there waiting. They didn't offer any sort of discount or anything.
So we ended up paying the full price, and while we were mad we were also happy because they had done such an amazing job! Honestly, it really was worth the $35, which is how much most places charge for gel manicures, it was just getting caught off guard that made us upset. When you go in preparing to pay one price and then end up having to pay something much more, it makes you upset, but they had done such a good job that we got over it and the color lasted a while without chipping or breaking our nails. We went to another place a couple of weeks later that charged the same amount, a place that seemed more upscale, and they didn't do as good of a job.

I ended up getting my mom a gift certificate for this place for christmas so she could get a couple pedicures, which she loved. And then, when I got a new job, I decided that I wanted to start getting acrylics. I decided to visit this place because even though they caught us off guard with the gel price, their full list of services aren't priced any differently than any other little nail salon I've been to. $12 for a manicure, $25 for a full set, etc. And I had loved their gel manicure so I went back.
I ended up sitting with a very sweet woman named Hannah, and she spent a good two hours on my nails. She made sure that they were all even, that there were no ridges, and that everything was perfect. She then asked me if I wanted some nail art, but I told her that I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the extra money for it, which she understood. When she was done painting my nails though, she brought out a couple of stripers and said that she would do the nail art for free. She free-handed some stuff on my ring fingers and it was gorgeous! I went back a couple of weeks later for a fill and asked her if she could change the shape to an almond one, and at first she was hesitant because she said my nails weren't long enough yet, but she ended up filing them that shape anyway. She said that they were too short and that they would look better when they were longer, but they were the perfect length for me.
So far I've been to two different people other than Hannah when I walked in without an appointment and she was too busy. I didn't get their names, but they did a fine job, just not as good of a job as Hannah. It just didn't seem like they really had the eye for detail like Hannah does, and they can't do nail art like she can, so now I know to always call ahead and make sure that she's available.
From what I've seen, they do a good job with simple things but if you want something very trendy or specific, they're going to have a hard time. Hannah does great with free-hadi

So long story short, don't believe their signs, make sure you ask and make sure that you know what you're getting before you just sit down and get your nails done. But once you know what you're paying for, they do a really nice job for decent prices. And remember to ask for Hannah!",Beauty

With Impasto being owned by two of Montreal's many best known chefs(Stefano Faita and Michele Forgione) It explains why my lunch was done to perfection. These two guys along with their wonderful staff, they certainly know what they are doing and it shows. 

Stepping into the restaurant, do look around. It's a beautiful, lovely, and modern ambiance. Especially during night time. With great little touches throughout the restaurant. 
Comfortable chairs, and spacious simple marble tables. Just beautiful!
When going for dinner and sitting at the bar, there is these lovely touches such as your own little copper light and with a wide open view of their open kitchen. Great concept! Very kind chefs who take their time to speak with you from time to time. 

When sitting down, this is where my eyes and mouth begins to work!
Right away we were greeted by a lovely, kind and well spoken waitress. Our menus were presented to us as she explains a bit as to how it works. Due to the fact it was my first visit there.  Certainly not my last!

After a few minutes, a lovely dish of their homemade bread sticks and focaccia  was served to our table. Followed by our drinks. For those that enjoy butter and bread. There is no need for the butter, the bread speaks for it's self. Believe me! 

When looking at their menu which changes from time to time, I was very pleased that for once a restaurant that does not have a strong focus on slathering large amounts of tomato bathed dishes or typical American dishes. Their menus has nothing but a strong authentic Italian emphasis on it. Thank you for that!
However... This is where I will be upfront about my one and only negative criticism. For the entrees there is only two choices. Both equally very delicious. Yet only two choices!
As for their main course.. again only three choices. 
Followed by dessert, only two choices. I do not need an encyclopedia size menu of choices, yet I did find that it lacked variety. Mainly because I know these guys and their staff can do magic in the kitchen and I would have liked to see more choices of their wonderful meals. 
Their menu has a bit of a concept. An entree + main course(Two services) $21 per person.  Or a main course with the addition of appetizer followed by the dessert(Three services) $27 per person. As always, drinks are not included!

So we begin with the appetizer. A warm octopus salad served with tender, fresh leaves of radicchio and a delicious vinaigrette. Absolute perfection in every bite. 
The octopus which is quite easy to overcook and change it's texture from tender to rubbery, our was perfectly tender, only very few delicate movements of the knife was necessary.  

Followed by two dishes of Fusili cacio e pepe(Fusili in a very light cream sauce, that stuck perfectly to the pasta without having a puddle of sauce at the bottom of our dish. With freshly grated and very tasty aged Parmesan cheese, finished by a potent taste of freshly grated black pepper! As for the pasta it's self. Simply and perfectly al dente. How it should be! 

Our meal was finished by a delicate and delicious Panna Cotta. Which is none other than heavy cream infused with vanilla bean, sugar, gelatin. It has the texture of a firm, but silky smooth, delicate custard. With a fresh, and tangy compote of strawberries. Fantastic! 

More often than not, I look for restaurants that has a strong focus on quality over quantity. As their portions may not be big much less massive(Which I love that in a restaurant!) Impasto hit the spot beautifully. You can truly taste the hard work, passion, and love they have for food. Especially since everything is freshly made by them. From their bread, to the bread sticks and pasta. True hard talented work pays off. My taste buds and I appreciate it very much so. 
I look forward in returning!",Restaurant

The store that bought my last two pairs closed. I heard about this store from my triathlon family talked about running assessment, Tom owner great guy, and hell was close to my house. Am in. 

It just so happened had a friend visiting from 808. She was looking to a get new pair of running shoes also. It worked out great cause she ended up getting the running assessment. There is one catch if you do get it. Basically need to be committed getting pair cause if not cost you $20. We both had every intention of getting pair just in my case decided pass. I found it interesting the whole process watching my friend do it. She ran on the treadmill just with socks (I found weird if breaking down someone foot strike pattern would want shoes on). They have camera that sits right behind and films your feet strikes or way both feet land. The sales lady (god bless her forget her name) she was breaking it down telling my friend her running style like gazelle. Whether your landing more on your heels or toe. They break it down to science not only the way your feet strike but the bigger picture your running style effects overall health. Running takes toll on ones body. Last thing anyone should do bad form next thing know had chronic back problems or what not. If know getting pair would recommend taking the time get one. They do take appointments for it. We went basically the store first opened took chance and we were the only ones in the store. It worked out great. Believe my friend got Asic or New Balance. She enjoys that since been out running on them couple times.

Myself I never knew until last year starting my triathlon addiction that having proper running shoes makes HUGE difference. I started with pair of Brooks. Actually just so happen my second pair got the same ones. If not broke why change it?? Really do love the fit and feel of Brooks running shoes. I have a feeling for the style one again my mind set was another pair of Brooks. She looked at my old pairs got the size. I did keep open mind about other brands. She started out bringing out shoes to try each one little different style then the next. Even for my friend we each tried on four or five different pair of shoes. We walked around the store and even better feel ran outside in the front up and down. The Brooks love the feeling, support under my feet, like the look, and ended up settling on my third pair of Brooks Ravenna. =))

Service was no doubt FIVE star one. The moment my friend and I walked in customer service could not have been more on point. She explained clearly the deal with the treadmill assessment. Like mention earlier you can tell she done few assessments. Not only with terminology but she knows what she talking about. The whole time trying on different pairs asking questions about the little comfort issues. Friendly. Easy make conversations with making the process easier and fun. She was bouncing between the two of us. Tom came in later he doing my friend finish instead of her jumping between both of us. She was telling Tom breakdown on her assessment. Tom talk about passion as owner. Great guy. Talking stories with him is blast, makes you laugh, also you can tell got wealth of knowledge with shoes (my friend use to Nike and he was telling her why not fan or really carries Nike), and cares about his customers. No pressure on buying pair of shoes or getting higher end shoe. Tom and his crew really do everything make sure you get the right one!

No doubt found my new running shoe store.",Shopping

The restaurant itself is clean and inviting, and Japanese pop music plays at a volume that permits normal conversation. If you sit at the bar, you can catch whatever game happens to be on that night, as well.

What really makes the atmosphere, however, is the staff. Taiko's waitresses are attentive and friendly and the restaurant enjoys minimal turnover which means they get to know their customers. Maggie is always on the floor making sure guests are having a great experience. 

Taiko's nigiri and sashimi are as fresh and delicious as any we had growing up in Florida. They have all the ""standards,"" but what really sets Taiko apart is the fact that there is almost always something you won't find everywhere else; it might be Spanish mackerel, bluefin, oysters on the half shell, or something else, but you can always count on finding a special treat on any given night.

Taiko has happy hour specials on appetizers (and beer) all week. The spicy squid salad and agadeshi tofu are both excellent, and a big bottle of ice-cold Koshihikari Echigo is a great way to wash down dinner. Oh, and the ginger squid will make your head spin.

They have a number of rolls, both traditional norimaki and the inside-out rolls preferred by most Americans. If a roll developed for Western palates in the 1970's is what you consider ""traditional,"" you might be disappointed to find that some of the different iterations of the California roll served at Taiko (and any other US sushi bar) are, in fact, drizzled with a little eel sauce. However, Maggie will gladly provide the uninitiated with a book of pictures; if you don't like eel sauce, just peek at the photos and order without. If you want a great dressed up Cali roll, the Boston and Alaska rolls are both fantastic, as is the candy cane roll with its garnish of fresh tomatoes and green onions. For a special treat, order the tootsie roll, full of tender tempura shrimp, but don't let the deliciously crispy tails go to waste.

Many of Taiko's best dishes aren't on the menu or specials board at all. Visit a few times and demonstrate an interest in eating ""off the beaten path,"" and Maggie will suggest something spectacular while sheepishly suggesting you might not like it because ""only Japanese usually order this..."" The yellowtail collar is one such dish and shouldn't be missed.

Taiko also serves tempura and teriyaki disheses, as well as some noodle dishes I'm told you can't find with any consistency in Japanese restaurants in the US, but we come for the sushi. Their beer and sake offerings are above average to excellent, and they are priced very reasonably. If you visit in the summer, be sure to order a glass of iced barley tea for something different.

In addition to being a skilled sushi chef, Toshi is also classically trained in French techniques and regularly produces specials that will rival any Pacific Rim fusion restaurant for quality and creativity. Even if there's not a special app or entree on the menu, diners are regularly treated to some homemade fresh fruit ice cream, flan, or another sweet bite after their meal.

Taiko also offers traditional dining experiences of Kaiseki and Shabu-Shabu, along with special sake tasting events, during some parts of the year. These special events are typically by reservation only. If you have any doubt about how traditional Taiko is, you only need to drop in for sushi when they're having one of these special events; you'll wonder if you haven't been transported across the Pacific--if you can get a table among all the happy Japanese transplants!

Overall, Taiko is a great place. Their sushi is consistently excellent, and you'll feel as though you're a welcome dinner guest at your Japanese friends' place. If you're not driving to Taiko when you go out for sushi in the Southeast Valley, you're just wasting gas.",Restaurant
QZhuM_ZKnmlO49K3Esp0HQ,tcWnoX_IfuDmlDl6o6y3_g,Vq-eRmIwiMgu2qZQquj21w,2008-06-26,"The Draft House is a great place to go if you're not necessarily up for trying someplace new and you are just looking for a nice time.  I mean this in the best possible way - this is a solid four stars in my opinion.  I find myself here a couple times a month because it is a proven commodity.  It helps that Verona falls between Middleton and Belleville, so I often meet my parents for dinner there.  My parents both really enjoy the place and the food is always up to snuff.  It may not be the most imaginative, but that's not what you really want at a bar & grill.  The menu is broad and covers a few styles, but mostly sticks with the tried and true burgers and sandwiches.  The appetizers are mostly familiar, but there are a few surprises to be found.  Last week my father tried the Irish Egg Rolls, which were basically egg rolls with a Reuben-style filling of corned beef, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese.  He was highly impressed.  My parents also love the spinach and artichoke dip, which is served in a bread bowl with vegetables and tortilla chips.  They often will just get that as a meal and split it.

I personally favor the Baja melt chicken sandwich and the Cuban sandwich as my two stand-bys, while I've never gone wrong with any of the wraps or burgers in the past.  They also have deli-style sandwiches (roast beef, turkey, etc.) that are perfect for lunch.  There are also daily specials that often prove to be the imaginative touch that may be missing from the menu.  I've not gotten around to trying the homemade pizzas yet, but I've heard quite a few good reviews.  My father has had the Friday fish fry before and he seemed to like it; I've never been a big fan of seafood so I usually pass.  There are dinner entrees as well (steak, salmon, pasta, etc.) but I don't believe that we've ever tried these, mainly because we generally sit in the bar area as opposed to the dining room.  The tap selection at the bar is usually pretty decent.  There's always a couple of Capital selections, including their seasonal, and at least 10-12 others.  I've never tried out the bartenders' knowledge of mixed drinks before, so I can't say either way regarding that aspect.

The restaurant is split into four areas.  The bar area is where most of the TVs are located and has about 12-15 tables with high stools and waitservice.  The dining room is to the rear and has pretty standard tables and boothes.  There is a lofted upstairs with a smaller bar.  There are a couple of pool tables and chairs along the railing, allowing people to watch the projection TV and look down on the bar area below.  Finally, there is an outdoor patio that looks out on Cross Country Road, also with waitservice.  I prefer sitting out on the patio or in the bar area myself.  The upstairs area is nice but it can get a bit smoky, since all the smoke from the bar area wafts up.  Downstairs is never that bad, which is why this is a four-star place for me instead of a three.  It works for me because my mother can smoke and my father and I aren't bothered.  I've been here a few times later on at night, and changes a bit to more of a local hang-out spot.  I've run into a few old friends from high school and generally had a good time, though for some unknown reason I'm completely unable to play pool at this bar.  The waitservice is almost always polite and prompt - once or twice we had to wait a bit out on the patio but that was coming off the lunch rush.  Parking in the lot can sometimes be a problem, especially during busy periods.  The lot will fill up, and the nearby street spots go quickly as well.  I'm really happy that Verona has a place like the Draft House.  It's the kind of place that everyone can agree on.",Restaurant
Rar1cLR3xDjb8pH_f6h6Lw,7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,eWKZyDPXdkhrT8v8XD2OrQ,2016-01-31,"Canyon Ranch is the spa\/salon face of the Venetian|Palazzo hotel complex. This was the first spa experience in Vegas for my mom, sister and myself and for Christmas last year my mom treated my sister and I to massages at the hotel spa. 

The spa club is accessible straight from the rooms themselves. Taking the elevator from your room to the 3rd floor will take you straight to the lobby. Allow at least 10 minutes from the time of your appointment to check-in as not only will you have to sign forms but they'll also take you on a tour of the facility if you're a first-time visitor. Upon check-in another staff member will take you on said tour. The tour did nothing to get me acquainted with the place as the massage rooms and common areas are all scattered. Half of the time I was there I was just trying to get oriented.

Upon entering the complex they'll ask you to replace your shoes with slippers that are used when walking around the complex. Once you get your slippers you are taken to the lockers where each person is assigned a locker and key. Opening and closing the lockers require a tap of the key. Contained inside the lockers are the robes that you'll use during the duration of your experience. 
There's another waiting area that people can use to wait for their service. It's divided into a quiet section and the non-quiet section. In the quiet section cell phone conversation is forbidden but each chair is comfortable and has its own lamp and electrical outlet. Flavored water, tea and fruit are complimentary and self-serve in the waiting area.

AQUAVANA
For each service booked that day you'll get complimentary access to the spa's facilities collectively called Aquavana or you can just purchase a day pass for about $40. There are two parts of Aquavana, the single-sex thermal environments and the co-ed gathering spaces. I didn't get to try everything as I didn't have a swimsuit on me and I was too conscientious to show my bare self (I'm not in Europe so American puritanical guilt is quite evident here).
- The saunas are sorted based on temperature and humidity. I actually preferred the dry sauna over the wet sauna as I was able to sit still and still able to see. I am slightly sensitive to humid saunas and can only be there for 5 minutes at a time. For the most humid sauna option the door was slightly broken and in order for the room to keep its humidity you had to push the door shut.
- I surprisingly enjoyed the Herbal Laconium. The herbs infused into the steam were pleasant smelling but not too strong that I could be there for an extended period. 
- Salt Grotto\/Wave Room: I have a hard time sitting still (the No1DP can attest to this) yet I was able to just still still and be immersed in the tranquil environment for at least 10 minutes in each room. I guess salted air and waves put me in a tranquil mood more readily. 

MASSAGE
I got the 50 minute Deep Tissue ($185\/50 minutes). Massages are tiered by the service offered and the day of the week of the service as a session is more expensive from Thursday-Sunday. I had a female therapist and she was able to apply the medium-firm pressure I asked for most of the time. My only criticism is that she could have applied more pressure on my upper back and shoulders as those areas are the places that tighten up easily. 

The services here are great but are super expensive for longer massages. A 30 minute extension to my massage is at least an additional $100. Ideally I like my 80-90 minute massages (as you don't feel rushed) but I'll have to look elsewhere for a more affordable massage place. 

---
For those that have the cash, Canyon Ranch is a great way to spend a full or half day just relaxing and focusing on yourself. In addition to the above services there's a salon, health club\/gym and a restaurant that serves healthy food. Maybe I'll have to learn to sit still longer so that I'll have more of an appreciation of this place.",Beauty

They settled in this past weekend and opened their doors for the first time Saturday night. We visited Sunday right at opening and were greeted by friendly staff eager to follow up opening night. 

Atmosphere

The decor was nice, tied in well with the seafood style with wood trimming abound. The couch adjacent to the wall was quite comfortable and it appeared as though the entire restaurant could seat about 60 with some extra room leftover. Greeting you as you come in to be seated is a mouth-watering raw bar. Further down is the more traditional bar which includes a neat feature that I haven't seen in Toronto, wine-on-tap. This feature was not quite ready for launch, but owner Matt told us that he will have it operational soon and that he is the first one to bring this to the city. There are a couple VQA wines available for $1\/oz, which is not bad. The music is a crossover between classic rock & hip hop at a decent volume. Brittney Spears was played at one point, to which Matt quickly got rid of and apologized. Rogue employee playlist or something more sinister? 

Drinks

We started out with the Rock Lobster Caesars, RLF's take on Caesars with a nice big beer mug and a lobster tail shoved in because why not! They were delicious with a solid kick, and the lobster tail was a nice contrast for the drink. Post meal we tried a couple of cocktails off the menu: Queen Pickle and White Rabbit. The  latter was far superior, a nice sour mix with delicious Tromba Tequila to stand on.

Eats

To start out we ordered two oysters each, one of each kind they had. Unfortunately their supply had been wrecked from opening night so they were down to one kind. Very fresh and delicious. We also had the Lobster Cappuccino which is the RLF take on lobster bisque and oh-boy did they nail it. Incredible bisque with nice chunks of lobster, chives and topped with Crème fraiche. Matt described his process in creating this dish and how he wanted to really nail it as a fresh take on bisque and he delivered. Our third and final appetizer was the jerk crab & shrimp. Be prepared to get messy eating this, you will be fully covered in oils and spices when finished. Trust me when I say it is totally worth it. The jerk spices were done the right way and didn't overpower the crustaceans at all. As all of the seafood we sampled tonight, it was fresh and delicious. Lastly, the mains came in. Lobster rolls, and the legendary RLF rolls are on the money. I don't believe I've had a better lobster roll anywhere and I've had a few.

Verdict

Matt owner\/chef came by our table a couple of times. You can tell he has a passion for his work and his cooking and it really comes across both in person and in the food. We told him that we hadn't had seafood this good since a trip to Boston years ago. Service was on point all night (even the bartender came out to check up on us), everyone was super friendly and enthusiastic. The web site definitely needs some work, namely menus and pictures of the new joint, but honestly that is how far I had to reach to come up with a complaint about this place. I am eager to see if they will maintain their high standard and will definitely be back soon to try out some more items. Lobster Poutine anyone?",Restaurant

This was our second visit here as the staff bungled the first visit in July so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again. Actually that's not really correct either as when we first stayed there we checked out after only being there for 2 1\/2 hours and had paid and not been reimbursed. No call back from management. They sent an e-mail bot ""how was your stay?"" only THEN a manager calls. I told him (Robert) my wife wouldn't be interested in returning. He pleaded and said that he would personally assure a wonderful experience.

When I called to book, Robert did not return 3 calls that I had made requesting the room. Yes 3 calls. I then called the front desk asked the gal to book a room with the voucher tells me she has a room with two beds. I said that doesn't work for my wife and I. She then tells me one king is available but for like $35.00 more. So yes there was one available, they just want to extort some extra $. So I'm thinking, ""This place screwed up badly, begged us to come back and then wants to nickel and dime me for a king bed,"" 

On that note, integrity is very important to me and this hotel has a dishonest staff.  If one thing happens, well meh. 2 things happen its alarming. 3 and 4 things happen, well, I'm pissed off. The pool bartender was nice. I was given 3 rounds of drinks while seated there and he only charged for 1. Yea, I hear folks screaming, ""What are you complaining about?"" Well, it's dishonest and it's stealing. I don't like thieves and didn't ask for free drinks nor did I expect them. I never walk in to Macy's to buy a shirt and expect the clerk to give me a tie and belt for free do I? 

This experience really sucks because I really really wanted to like this place as I have a liking to mid-century kitschy cool design and this place fits that bill. Rooms are retro-eclectic and nice. I hurt my back prior to coming here and was rather annoyed that no one told us that there were no elevators so I had to lug luggage up stairs which irritated me. I understand it's an older building but staff should have said something prior. It is a LONG HAUL  from your room to go get ice. I also went to the restaurant to ask for a spoon as my wife had some Ben & Jerrys and the server was rude. Otherwise we checked out without incidence - I thought. 

My wife comes to me a couple days later and asks me what the $50.00 charge was. So I call the hotel to inquire Kristen told me I was charged for a bottle of Belvedere Vodka. I assured her that we did not drink it. She said it would be refunded. I told her I was disturbed that I was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said, ""Well obviously...somebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number ...or anything could have happened. But we'll get it sorted out for you."" I said, ""OK Please do"" and guessed that was the end of it.  I also wasn't very satisfied with the ""anything could have happened"" explanation. 

To me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation. It's not like they don't have my e-mail and\/or phone number to inform me of the charge. That's dishonest. My guess would also be an integrity issue again with the Hotel Valley Ho staff for missing liquor. 

I was never reimbursed.  I call back AGAIN 3 weeks later and Brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information. The same Brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked, ""What was the issue?"" and in a somewhat curt tone. I explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and weren't. He then said in a snarky fashion, ""Fine, if you didn't take it home with you then I'll reimburse it to your Visa."" At this point I'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that I might be lying about it. Nice way to treat your customers. 

Well, guess what? Yea, Brian never reversed the charges. Twice they said they would reverse the charges and didn't; feels really dishonest at this point. It's only $50 bucks but to me it's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a ""charge dispute"" was time consuming and once again irritating. I have much better things to do then waste time with the Hotel Valley Ho's bungling.",Beauty

We checked out Yelp and some other sources in advance and settled on a couple of places that served pizza as our primary targets. It happened to be a particularly cold evening and before we left the hotel, the kind manager at the front desk suggested a third spot, ""just in case."" Never having been to the area before, we felt our way, through the strange streets and the increasing chill in the air, to Rue Dante, where our first dinner choice turned out to be a bit upscale for Pizza. While the place seemed pretty busy there also appeared to be plenty of room for at least two more. Wrong we were. As it turns out, all those empty tables and chairs were 'booked', we were told by a very snooty hostess and there was just no possible way we would be enjoying pizza in their very popular spot on this particular Friday night. No worries, because as it turned out, that back up eatery suggested to us on our way out of the hotel was just down the block. On the way, we passed another decent looking place and as we walked with purpose  through the frigid cold Canadian evening we agreed we'd circle back if necessary.   Sure enough, chic hot spot number two - only half full with customers - was also ""fully booked"" and we were SOL once again. The owner was kind enough to send us down the street to yet another place he told us he ""eats at himself"" and of course when we got there, it was completely out of business. Guess it had been a while since he enjoyed their cuisine. At this point we were cold, hungry and starting to feel like we were trapped in a surreal film with food everywhere yet nothing we could eat.  So we doubled back to that place we passed between our first two rejections and sure enough, it too was completely booked. Strike three! How was this possible? It was 7:30 on a Friday night in Montreal and apparently impossible to eat in ""Petite Italie.""  We had just about given up, as we walked passed the most popular pizza place in town and saw two hours worth of crowd waiting outside in the cold. And it was at that moment we spotted Tratotoria Casa Mia. On the doorstep was a guy wearing an apron and stealing a smoke. Inside 6, maybe 8 folks enjoying their meals and plenty of other unpopulated empty tables. The feel was casual and comfortable, but was there room for us? The nice Italian woman reading her paper at an empty table got up to greet us and before we knew it, our Montreal dinner nightmare was over. Within  minutes, that same Italian woman would be in the kitchen cooking up our meal.
Our waiter, busy as he was taking care of all the tables, was welcoming, took our order quickly, made sure we got our bread and beverages while we waited and in good time, brought our lasagna and pasta, too.  And much to our surprise, considering how empty this place looked and how no other restaurant in the area would even let us in, the pasta and lasagna were both really good.  In short, this was a terrific little restaurant that apparently is not part of the ""scene"" in ""Petite Itlalie"" which is too bad because the food was terrific, the service was good, the prices were more than fair and the people who run the place were flat out warm and welcoming.
If you find yourselves in ""Petite Itlaie"" at some point without reservations, skip the crowds, skip the ""scene"" and skip the most popular joints in the hood and slide into Tratorria Casa Mia for lunch or dinner, instead. It's worth it not to wait.",Restaurant
Kb20Q62sUT2cHUeN3tlRgA,MwS--Ef3rGo1WtsKcgWOwA,4idDscpVRyQIPbhg6n4IgA,2009-11-09,"We stumbled upon this place on the way to do some climbing at Whipp's Ledges.  We'd planned to grab a bite to eat at Whitey's, but learned that they wouldn't be serving food until 4 pm.  So we took off in the car and ended up at Teschner's Tavern, which looked from the outside to be an absolute hole in the wall.  

When we walked in there was only one other patron, a guy sitting at the end of the bar sipping on a drink.  I asked if the kitchen was open and was told that it absolutely was.  The menus were given to us, and I was quite impressed with the selection of food available.  I asked what was ""good o order today"" and the bartender told me that I should order the Mac 'n Cheese, and ask for bacon and diced tomato in it.  She told me this was ""f***ing good"", so I decided with a testimonial like that I should go for it!  This dish was $3.95.  I also ordered a mini cheeseburger which was $1.50.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken philidephia sandwich and onion rings.  After we put in our order, we decided to sit at a table instead of the bar, as it had a direct view of a gorgeous flat screen TV where we could watch the start of the OSU game.  

A few things that kept this restaurant from getting 4 stars were observed as we waited for our food.  1) ambiance- basically this place has none of it, but that isn't really what we were looking for. 2) service- again, not really any service.  The cook pretty much was in the back cooking and occasionally came out, the bartender was chatting with the now 2 patrons at the bar.  We were the only 2 guests.  She did bring my a whole pitcher of soda to the table, but my boyfriend's water never got refilled.  3) the first beer my boyfriend ordered was at the end of the keg.  She gave him that 1\/4 pint anyway, for free, but it was kind of gross with a bunch of floaties in it.

But then... came the food.  It was AMAZING.  Nothing at all that I would have expected coming from a place like this.  Everything tasted like it was freshly made.  I felt like I was at my grandma's house.  Flavor, flavor, flavor! My Mac 'n Cheese was so creamy and cheesy and gooey.  The tomato and bacon with it really DID make it f'in good. My ""mini cheeseburger"" was about the size I would make a regular burger on the grill at home.  And it tasted just like something my dad would have delivered to my plate, like the ground beef had just been pressed into a patty immediately before it was fired up, nothing processed or frozen.  

My boyfriend's chicken Philly was a bit surprising. It was on a regular bun instead of a hoagie roll, and had an actual chick breast on it.  Again, this reminded me of going over to Grandma's and she threw this together with what she had in the kitchen at the time.  The onion rings were also phenomenal.  My grandpa had a fryer when I was growing up, and would slice up some thick onions, bread them, and throw them in.  These tasted just like Grandpa's.  

The lady who was cooking when we were there, Michelle, loves to cook and it comes across clearly on the plate.  Our lunch was excellent.  If I'm ever in that area again, for a walk of for climbing, I am absolutely stopping in at Teschner's for a bite to eat.",Restaurant

I used them for hair, makeup, and spray tan for both my engagement and wedding photo's, and was impressed every time! I have already reviewed them for my engagement photo's, which were amazing, but I want to focus specifically on my wedding day for this review.
  
 To start I had a spray tan done by Shekiera the night before my wedding. She came to my parents house at 8pm, (where I was staying) set up a portable tanning ""booth,"" and performed the tan in the spare room. No mess, no remnants of spray, no stains. The tan was perfect! It lasted about nine days, but faded very evenly, no funky spots like other spray tans I have had. It is nice to have it at home, no stress, plus I didn't have to worry about driving home, braless, with certain clothes, or not wanting to wash your hands or face when you return home.... you can just hop in pj's and go straight to bed. Shekiera is very professional, I did my tan completely naked and never felt uncomfortable or awkward, she explains every step and has you look at stages to make sure it is what you want and are comfortable with it. This was my second tan by Shekiera, the first looked perfect the night of but a lot washed off the next morning. I had her go a lot darker the day before the wedding and after my first shower the next day, the color was perfect! I would recommend you do at least one test tan before your wedding to get used to the steps you have to follow and see how you like it the following day after your first shower. But, no tan lines, and no hours and hours spent in tanning beds makes this an excellent pre wedding option.

 I had my hair done by Deb, I chose not to do an up do, my Husband prefers my hair half up and half down so thats what I wanted to do. She never pushed a certain style and was willing to do anything I asked. This women has some magical skills. She worked on my hair as I had my make up done, I knew she was behind me because we were talking but other than that, I had no idea she was there! No rough tugging, no hairspray in my eyes or surprise curling iron burns... and all of a sudden... bam... I had this perfect hair do. She did exactly like I asked, It lasted 12 hours, never lost my curls... even after wearing silly props in the photo booth. 

 As for makeup, I saved the best for last. I absolutely love Megan! She knew me and my personality after just a few minutes of chatting. I am quite the jeans and T-shirt, no make up, phony tail kind of girl... and she respected that. She kept my natural look that I like, but made me look beautiful! She was sure to get my approval after stages so I didn't feel like she did to much. She was calm and soft spoken with such positive energy in a whirlwind of stress and chaos. We had 15 people in my Mom's house when they arrived and I was pretty overwhelmed. Megan took me over, smiled and calmly brought my stress down just with her presents. She did everything she could to make sure I was comfortable and happy with my appearance. Megan provides you with a kit of everything you need to touch up, just a quick blend with the make up pad easily fixed any small smears from my tears of joy, and a few dabs of lip stick before pictures were all I needed. The make up easily lasted throughout the night, at least 12 hours. 

 The ladies were always on time, and most often early. My hair and make up took about one hour total. Megan and Deb are such a great team, they both worked simultaneously with no stress on me! Megan kept complete communication with me with everything. Pre tanning instructions, pre hair and make up instructions, I was never in the dark about what to do and what to expect, and I always felt comfortable about what was going on around me. As for price, I felt like their prices were completely competitive with other air brush services in town. I would have paid double for Megan and her team if it came down to it. This is a day you will remember forever and pictures you will have to cherish, you want to know you will look good no matter what. Don't take any chances, these women are amazing!

Jmp9FHYoOHFlz_-GqjvTCg,A1rTFUjasNRw6nM5EcQZHg,RVTxiiWQwmeSJonJgYwwWg,2013-06-14,"The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because I would try this place again to see if maybe I just got stuck with an awful nail tech, but from my first visit, I'm NOT impressed at all.

Aesthetically the place is wonderful.  It's beautifully decorated and looks like something out of a Martha Stewart magazine and the employees are pleasant.  If it were graded on first impressions, I would give it a 5.  

The price for a basic pedicure isn't that bad ($28 non member price) considering this isn't your typical Asian salon except even with 2 ""luxuries"" added for $10 more my pedicure was pathetic compared to what I can usually get at any old cheap strip mall salon for much less.  My nail tech was nice and polite, but the pedicure was not good.

The foot baths don't have jets in them and you sit on a long, high back (comfortable) bench, but there are no massaging chairs and you can't recline. 

When booking the appointment, I was asked about any luxuries I'd like to add on because they could make the appointment take longer (perfectly reasonable question from someone making the schedule).  I was told the basic pedicure would be about 30-40 minutes and include a 5 minute foot massage.  The callous remover I added would not make the appointment any longer and no mention of a time change was mentioned for the sugar scrub I also added.  I could have added on an additional ""luxury"" for more money to get a longer massage, but even so the massage I did get was so short\/bad\/non existent I can't even remember getting one.  I certainly wouldn't have paid anymore to have her touch my feet for longer.

I don't believe she ever cleaned under my nails and certainly didn't push back and cut my cuticles.  I can only remember her cutting my nails and filing them.

The callous remover and sugar scrub cost $10 more and were not worth the added cost.  My callouses may be a tad smoother than they were to begin with, but are certainly not gone which is the usual result when getting my feet done.  The sugar scrub, while it did come out in a cute little ceramic dish with fresh herbs in it, was applied incredibly poorly and was nothing ""scrubby"" about it since the nail tech acted like she thought I would bruise if she applied any pressure whatsoever (same problem with the massage).  Even after telling her I like the massage part done firmly she made no noticeable change in how she was working.  Oh, and my lower legs were not included in the 5 minute massage or the sugar scrub application like is the case with EVERY other nail salon I've ever been to...high end or strip mall. 

The nail polish, though I'm pleased with the color, was put on far too thick and got smooshed to the side and got the imprint of my couch cushions on them despite having a few hours to dry.  The polish and clear coat were left on my skin as well.

All said and done, my pedicure was over in 45 minutes (that included my 2 luxuries), I sat for a few minutes to let me nails dry a bit (there is no nail drying station) and spent $45 including the tip for a pedicure I feel I could have done equally well or better myself.

The real deal breaker for me (though I may try a different nail tech one day to see if I just got a dud) was how embarrassingly pathetic the massage\/scrub part was.  I can spend less money and have a 60+ minute pedicure experience with 15 minutes of excellent  lower leg and foot massage and actually have my callouses removed, my polish look nice, a back massage from a reclining chair from a cheapy Asian nail salon and that's what I will go back to.

If you want to pay the extra money to feel good about what a fancy salon you go to, Teres is perfect.  It really is a beautiful place, but if you want to be impressed with the quality of the pedicure, just go to the local strip mall salon.",Beauty

Since my 5 star 2 months ago, I'm retracting 4.   All good dishes must come to an end.  So too, must the rarely bad ones here, and the few excellent.  

I phoned ""Counterman B---"",  the ever-present Dragon-keeper, to almost apologetically, tell him the first-time-tried dishes just picked up---Pork Lo Mein and Yu Shan Pork---were not edible because of too much fat and gristle.  The glum (as usual)  B--- offered to refund without my asking, said he was very busy, then abruptly hung up before I could thank him and place another order.  I called the next day to do this, and he said the cook was upset, and that we should find another restaurant.  ""WHAT?  I don't understand."", taken by surprise.  ""Why do you eat our food?"" he asked.  ""Because we really LIKE it."", I answered, perplexed.  (In all our visits the only other issue was about 5 years ago when they had forgotten to add essential seasoning ingredients to a chow mein sauce in a relative's take-out.  It was just water and cornstarch.  I knew this, because I prepare Asian dishes myself.  It was replaced without a problem.)   He just repeated that we should find another restaurant.  ""I've written really good reviews for you."", I said, ready to tell him about this site.  ""I know."", he quickly replied.  (!?)  I don't know how, since neither my husband nor I ever told him.  Again, he said he'd refund, then hung up.

Confused, I told my husband what B--- had said.  ....ah-HAH.  Apparently, the two had exchanged a few words when the order was picked up.  (Maybe other times, too, I suspect.)  If B--- didn't like my husband checking the bag before leaving, it was only because of a $30 take-out the week before, when the requested extra mustard for five egg rolls was missing.  My husband told him that the amount they gave was not nearly enough (totally agree; 2 of their smallest containers) and that that's why we requested extra again, this time.  (Their hot mustard is better than I've been able to find or make myself.)   B--- then said he'd have to charge us.  CHARGE US?   When a restaurant skimps on necessary condiments, forcing fairly regular patrons to pay extra just to reach a normal and reasonable quantity, is blatantly insulting.    Understandably, that didn't go over well with my husband.  Either the Dragon is desperate to squeeze out a few extra cents on take-outs, or---for WHATEVER ridiculous reason---they don't want our business.  Or both.  Fine.  Judging from the sub-standard meat in these last two dishes, they may be taking the low road of low grade meats or have turned off onto the untrimmed route.  

This ""conflicting personality thing"" between the two may have been steaming over time, and finally reached the boiling point with B---.  They may have had ""bones to pick"" with each other, but I was stuck with Fat Lo Mein and Yu Shan Gristle in two large containers.  I ended up eating a small amount of noodles from one (too mushy), and some green beans from the other.  The rest I threw out.  The thought of ever walking back into the Dragon for a well-deserved refund, was too unappetizing.   And here I had been my normal nice and friendly self, almost regretting having to voice a legitimate complaint.  Little did B--- know that I wasn't going to bother telling him about the other off-putting components in our order.  I will here.  

The fat and gristle content was quickly confirmed after a couple bites of each, but it was when I looked through the containers again for any edible pieces, that I found more unwelcome surprises.   Coated in brown sauce, and roundish golf-ball in size, were two thick and oddly-curled shapes, looking like---no kidding---tarantulas.   Initially shocked and repulsed, in disbelief I carefully picked one of them up by a 1 inch ""leg"".  Turning it around for closer examination, it DID look very much like the spiders' heftier relative.  Believing that these couldn't possibly be what they appeared to be, I pulled off a couple of the appendages to bravely (gulp) test them.  Phew.  It DID taste like pork.  (Then again, I have no idea what tarantulas taste like.)   Instead of tossing into the garbage someone had actually saved two globs of trimmings and carved them into these off-putting shapes.  awlgh.  This was taking repurposing to a whole new---but disturbingly gross---level.   

Because they were intentionally cut into these shapes, maybe they were meant to be---garnishes!?  But those are edible---much like the fanciful roses, petals, spirals, and lotus blossoms carved from fruits and vegetables.  Not from meat!  Now it IS possible---although hard to imagine---that they might have been intended to resemble chrysanthemums.  Misfire!  They ended up looking more like members of the Theraphosidae family---not flowers.

ozqOLXI2ZAwghLRMZZZ71A,ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,0anXSUX9KG5sQEzs-Of8Vg,2012-11-19,"Buddy and I were out Saturday night looking for Verdun eats, trying to find a place neither of us had gone to but at the same time, not too overpriced. Neither of us wanted to pay for a $20 hamburger.

Lo and behold, we stumbled upon Les Delices. It turns out their specialty is the food of that tiny island in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius. Because of the island's history and closeness to both India and Africa, the cuisine of Mauritius has all these different influences. Curry, coconut milk, rice, saffron, lamb from the Indian and Muslim presence on the island. Octopus, ox-tail, beans, fish cakes, Cajun, Creole from the African influence. Throw in a Chinese, Old Dutch and French, and that's Mauritius for you.

We spotted a complete dinner menu including appetizer, main and coffee\/tea for between $16-$12. What really stopped me dead in my tracks was this included curried lamb shank for $14. Seriously, where on earth can you get lamb, done very well for under $30 in this day and age?

This is one thing which upsets me about ethnic dining in general especially when trying out the foods from smaller, poorer countries which are usually off the foodie radar screen. Very often, they are run by recently arrived immigrants who are trying to start out a new life. They usually don't have a lot of money to put into decor and making it look chi-chi. It's usually the bare-bones school of decor. Instead they put their heart and soul into the food. People look in, judge, get turned off and the place is then not open for very long. Judging a book by it's cover here, will make you miss out on the treasures to be found within, that's for sure.

We were warmly welcomed and seated. Stickers citing this place from all sorts of guides and guidebooks were plastered all over the front door. Within a minute of being seated, we were given an ""amuse-bouche"", a pre-appetizer of deep friend cabbage fritters. I never had anything that was so simple and yet, very tasty. Dowse it with the choices of hot pepper, garlic or mint sauce sitting on your table and you're set.

Next came the fried calamari and fish balls. Both were great, the calamari was made with a batter that clearly had some fresh herbs in it.

Then came the lamb shank.

OMFG! It was falling off the bone, it was that super tender and flavorful. You have your choices of sauces which you'd like your meat to be prepared in, like Curry, Cajun, Creole, Saffron and others which i can't remember right now. I chose the curry sauce and it was amazing. It came with a heaving serving of rice and salad. By the end, neither of us could barely move, it was that rich and that filling. The owners and servers were extremely friendly and attentive.
They even gave us a free desert, a selection of cheesecakes. Bonus, this place is BYOB.

I am definitely going to go back to at least try out the octopus and ox-tail stew. This place is a gem in the rough, but a gem nonetheless.",Restaurant
n5PmmxUqma-5Gn8hCPjPdw,ORceu2UCCWxyRzvoElYotw,oC5CzTlS1vqbbi4k-E4RKQ,2014-02-28,"Ray's is a one-of-a-kind experience for those wishing to maintain their mountain\/BMX bicycling skills during the winter months, and also for those who want to add to those skills with more technical challenges.  Cleveland is truly fortunate to have this resource.

The Pros: 

Offering everything from raw beginner to extremely advanced courses, there's something for everyone at Ray's.  

The atmosphere is extremely friendly toward newer riders (my wife and I fell into this category when we joined a year ago).  While there will always be those highly skilled riders who look down on those less-skilled than themselves, the predominant attitude is one that allows new riders to move at their own pace.

EXTREMELY family friendly.  It's very common to see entire families there, often having packed for the whole day...coolers, lawn chairs, things to read, etc.  In that way, Ray's is a lot like the atmosphere you'd find at a weekend racetrack event for kids.  And part of the fun for me is watching the tiny kids all geared up and flying around on their bikes, making some of the adults (like me) look bad.

There are many different courses and they're laid out in a way which allows most people to comfortably progress in gaining skills.

Cons:

Expensive.  I'm not knocking what they charge, but at over $20 per visit, it can add up quickly.  My wife and I bought an annual pass immediately, which isn't cheap...but when you do the math, you quickly see how much money it can save you if you plan to hit Ray's often.  And there's a deep discount for multiple people on the same pass.

The experience is very dependent upon the day\/time you go.  A weekend afternoon can be a real zoo, and you need to be prepared for that...a few inconsiderate assholes or very inexperienced riders can really make things unpleasant (or even dangerous).  There are many spots on the various courses where you need momentum to get beyond an obstacle, and if there are a ton of people in the building, someone will inevitably slow down or stop at just the wrong moment.  Obviously weeknights are best if you want to avoid the crowds.

Having said what I did about the way things are laid out for an easy learning curve, my wife, being completely new to mountain biking and only recently come to road biking, found the learning ""curve"" to be more like a staircase, with some of the next ""steps"" requiring more risk than she was comfortable with.  However, I think this might be normal for activities like this...you can stay inside your comfort zone all day long, but if you want to move to the next level, a certain amount of risk is required.  If you're extremely risk-averse, Ray's may not be your kinda place.

Things to know:

Helmets are required (and you'll want one).  They're available for free, but you're welcome to bring your own.  Protective gear is encouraged, and necessary...everything inside Ray's is HARD.  There's no grass or dirt.  It's all wood and concrete.  Even grazing your elbow as you pass by a cement wall is going to scrape, so I suggest elbow and knee\/shin guards at a minimum.  The latter is available for free at the counter.

There's only vending machines, so if chowing down during a workout is your thing, pack it in.  It's not unusual to see a Domino's driver in the parking lot.

Mountain bikes or BMX bikes are required.  No hybrids or road bikes.  High-quality rentals are available.  

If you have an season pass you can leave your bikes there onsite at no charge, which is great in the winter in Cleveland, since you're not gonna wanna get your bike all salted up on your car rack.

There are lockers onsite, but they're very tiny.  Most people take over a spot on a table and just leave their stuff laying there.  I've never heard of something being stolen, but your best bet is not to bring anything in you're worried about, unless someone will be sitting with your stuff while you ride.

There's no charge if you just want to hang out and watch.  And it can be pretty entertaining, especially on a weekend, so don't be afraid to bring your non-riding friends or family members along.",Shopping

I was excited to see a deal for a full set of lash extensions for only $50 so I purchased it. I'm used to paying around $100 (not including tip) for a set. When I called to make an appointment the girl who answered the phone told me to make sure I tip the technician based on what a set of lash extensions normally cost, $375 according to her. First of all, I've NEVER in my 3 years of getting this service seen a price of $375. I think the most I've ever paid is $125 and that's for about 90 minutes of solid lash work. Second, I found her advice on how I should tip to be flat out tacky. I was also told not to purchase deals on HomeRun or  Groupon for this salon because those companies take a big chunk of the fee.  I know this, but then don't post your services on those sites! Unprofessional. I later found out that they always charge $50 for extensions and fills, which is a great deal....more on that later. The day of my  appointment I was called about 30 mins prior and told my appointment was pushed back 30 mins. OK. I get there, I wait another 40 mins. It took at least 10 mins for anyone to even greet me. The place was empty. No one getting manicures or haircuts. That should have been my first sign to run for the hills. I could hear yelling and laughing and loud chatting coming from the back. No biggie. I'm a friendly, relaxed and sociable person, but it was odd that I could hear inappropriate conversations about very personal subjects from where I was seated at the front door. I let it slide. Finally I get into the lash room and lie down. The previous customer is still in there, chatting away with the esthetician. Ok, again kind of weird but I am a good sport. It takes another 5 minutes before she gets started. During the service, several people come in just to chat with the technician. Again, super unprofessional but I'm willing to accept this if my lashes come out looking extraordinary. During my 1 hour appointment, I estimate she spent about 40 minutes total on actual lash application. She got up and left the room several times. The entire time I could hear people talking, laughing and joking in the front of the salon (again, no biggie...but it just added to the general unprofessional feel of the salon). The woman who applied my lashes is the owner, and I really expected a more relaxing and professional experience. But it was such a good deal so I remained positive. When the technician was finished my lashes looked ok. Not as many as I'm accustomed to having, but they looked pretty and I figured that for $50 it wasn't bad. When I got home I realized that several of my upper lashes were stuck with lash glue to the bottom lashes. Then, several of the lashes fell of that very night. Within one week I probably had three lashes left on each eye. This was just unacceptable. I know how to take care of lash extensions and have lots of experience preserving how they look, and never have they fallen off so quickly. Typically my lashes would look this awful after 6 weeks, not 6 days. I really debated on giving Wind & Water a second try. I really wanted to like this place and the service and the owner was a nice person and easy to talk to...but it's wasn't even worth the $50 (plus a tip based on $375, which I did in good faith only to regret it  later). Oh, and good luck trying to make\/cancel\/reschedule an appointment. Rarely does the phone get answered and the voice mailbox is always full and there is not even an outgoing message letting you know you've reached the right place. UNPROFESSIONAL and disappointing all around :( Bummer.",Beauty
zkxc78kc7pUQM9zGQXfkWw,oJgRDal6AC-wcxXBbP2zKg,_jsxUnZ8Iq8_kZNQcnzyrQ,2014-11-07,"I have been coming here since they opened as part of Station Casinos. I enjoy the variety of slot machines and the great customer service of the front line employees.  When they opened I was hoping for a five star property (dining, drink service, rooms) but instead only found a two star property, décor of lobby, rooms excluded.  Yes even though I am a local I have stayed here a couple times.  So, that being said, here is my opinions of the different areas.
1.  DINNING:  The buffet is mediocre at best.  Minestrone soup (on most days) has pieces so big they don't fit on the spoon.  Fruit is cut in weird shapes and doesn't look appetizing.  Pizza from premade crusts.  Very few non-fried or healthy options.  Chef said all food is prepared in-house and fresh. BS!  Service used to be good, now it is spotty, depending on server.  My wife and I were not offered drink refill even though we had empty glasses sitting on edge of table and dirty plates were taken away.  Had to ask more than once. The only fresh fish offered is tilapia, yuck! Raise the price a buck or two and give us quality food.  Why is there not a decent buffet north of the strip?  Next is FARM, the 24hr coffee shop.  The food is good, when prepared properly and pretty affordable.  God help you if they screw up your order.  The wait staff is pleasant, but the kitchen keeps missing the mark.  Took 20 min to remake a deli sandwich. Salted Lime is another example.  Great service, but inconsistent food.  Sometimes really good, sometimes really bad.  MRKT steakhouse.  The food and service is always top notch.  Never complained about any dish or service issues here.  Other outlets can learn a thing or two from them.  As stated in other reviews, there is TGIF and food court where you know what to expect. 
2.  CASINO:  Good variety of slot games and floor very well laid out.  There needs to be more blackjack tables.  Mostly double deck with no mid-round buy in, but only one with a shoe.  Does have the right amount of craps and roulette tables.  Drink service on casino floor is spotty.  Sometimes it can take 30-45 min for waitress to come by for the first time, others 5min.  Weird.  Sports book has nice big screens, easy to see games and horse races. 
3.  THE REST:  Nice Regal movie theaters, some with IMAX and 3D.  $4 for seniors on Mondays.  The pool area is lovely.  The parking is convenient and ample.  I usually park in the garage where I can almost always find a space near the elevators.  At least the new owners decided it was ok to use all the levels.  Outside, I can't understand why they put crosswalks away from where they should be.  People are always jaywalking and not looking where they are going.  The rooms are well appointed but somehow there is always something wrong.  Lightbulbs were burned out on one occasion, towels missing on another, no ashtray in  smoking room.
4.  RECAP:  I sure hope that someone from upper management reads these reviews on yelp.  You advertise 5star property but are surely lacking in what is expected at this level of service.  You now have had 2 years under this management team and things are not improving.",Beauty

This place is still great and has become a Las Vegas tradition for my friends and I. We stop here every time our trip coincides with one of the seafood nights (Tuesday and Friday). The soup of the day rotates and it is always a special treat when it is the clam chowder. The cold seafood continues to be the highlight of this buffet although the hot foods have gotten slightly better (although not enough yet to make this a 5 star buffet even at the very affordable price). We have turned many of our friends onto this place and the 11pm closing time is great for our friends that drive in from Southern California after work on Fridays. On our last trip, the crab legs were no longer split. I prefer them split as it makes them easier to eat, but I know others feel unsplit crab legs retain their taste better. The biggest surprise was that they now have added snow crab claws. They were delicious despite being a little hard to eat (although once you learn the trick they're easier to eat than snow crab legs even with the harder shell).
_______________________________________________________________

This was the surprise of my last trip. I really wasn't expecting much since you never really hear about any downtown buffets outside of the one at the Fremont's sister property: Main Street Station. Well, we were hungry and the seafood fantasy night sounded good so we decided to give it a shot. 

The room it is served in might be described as tacky by some, but I really like it. It has that old school feel. This is actually where Trent and Mikey ended up eating after losing all their money in Swingers. That movie does not come close to capturing the feel of this room. Plus the service was pretty good. 

The main draws of seafood fantasy night are the snow crab legs (split for easier eating), oysters, and peel and eat shrimp. The crab was pretty good. The shrimp tasted good too, but they were seasoned and I would have preferred them unseasoned. The oysters were awesome. I ate about a dozen and my friend had 2 dozen. I'm sure others in the buffet had more. These oysters were small, but tasted good and fresh. They were as good as any other oysters I've ever had; just smaller. I usually am weary of buffet oysters, even the Rio's famous seafood buffet has terrible oysters, but these were good. They also have a small sushi section which was pretty basic shrimp nigiri and California roll variations. I'm surprised they didn't have more variety. They also have a clam chowder that no one notices because they put it next to the honeydew melon. I had actually finished eating and wanted to get a few pieces of melon for dessert when I noticed it and got a bowl. The chowder is very good. My friend said it was the best thing at the buffet. He ended up skipping dessert and eating another bowl of the chowder. Actually, instead of using the little chowder bowls, he grabbed an ice cream sundae bowl from the dessert station and got himself a huge bowl of clam chowder.

The other items in the buffet are also mostly seafood. Nothing really stood out except for the trout which was very good. Some of the items were a little on the dry side such as the lasagna that had almost no ricotta and the seafood enchiladas. I would have preferred it if they kept more of their regular dishes instead of doing so many seafood dishes on seafood fantasy night. I like a little turf with my surf and the only items that weren't seafood, bread, or vegetables were the meats at the carving station and the fried chicken.

All in all, I was really impressed by the quality and price.",Restaurant

I've been to Suddenly Slimmer for a few procedures (nothing major or crazy...) to get rid of some unwanted scars and tone some areas of skin. I mean, let's face it ladies (and men, too), we're our own worst critics when it comes to our body. 

The first time I went in for a consultation, I had the pleasure of speaking with and meeting Jeanie. She was extremely professional, courteous, patient (I had tons of questions), and knowledgeable. She went into great detail about removing the scarring and the procedure and basically walked me through the whole process from beginning to end -- and what to expect thereafter. She was honest and didn't try to up-sell me on anything I didn't need just to get more money out of me. Well, after taking a few days to think about everything, I was ready to book. I called and spoke with the delightful front office staff and booked my appointment. 

On the day of my treatment, I was a bit nervous but the technician calmed my nerves, explained everything and kept me chatting away the entire time as if we were long lost friends now reunited. The treatment, although a bit painful (I mean, removing deep scars from years ago isn't an easy thing to do), went by super quickly, and I was out of there before I knew it. The technician sent me home with after care instructions and even called me the next day to check up on me... how's THAT for exceptional customer service and showing they care about their patients?! 

I also got some skin tightening treatments... when you lose weight, no amount of working out will tighten the skin. So, I turned to the next best thing ('cause I refuse to go under the knife) -- non-invasive treatments. Now it did take a few months to see the results as my body also needed to heal naturally, however, wow -- I love the results!!! 

Well, seeing how I'm a sucker for a day at the spa, and always looking for new ways to pamper myself... 'cause if I don't, who's gonna?! I booked more treatments at the spa. (And I gotta be honest, the amazing email deals and specials were taunting me). So I finally called and booked a micro-needling facial -- you know, where it brings new blood to the skin and helps reduce lines and wrinkles, and makes your skin ""baby soft"" (not that I have any lines and wrinkles now, but why not nip those before I get them?! I think ahead... hehe). I called and spoke with the sweetest front desk girl (I'm sorry I don't remember her name), and booked my appointment for a facial, yay! I'm extremely excited for my appointment and can't wait to see the results (don't worry, I'll post before and after pictures).  

Not sure why this place has such a low star rating, quite honestly they're the best spa around The Valley that offers treatments to look your best. I called several places prior to booking with Suddenly Slimmer -- and although they are a bit far from where I live, I happily drive here over going anywhere else. They are professional, have amazing technicians and staff, have the most up-to-date procedures and newest equipment... all for incredibly reasonable prices! Seriously, I wouldn't go elsewhere. Suddenly Slimmer has a client for life with me!",Beauty

If you're looking for anything to adorn a human, a bed, a kitchen counter, a shelf, bathtub, tabletop, or even a TV tray, try this TJ Maxx.     

I'm not a regular, but for the past 15 or so years I've popped in every few months with either something specifically in mind, or just to see what might grab me.  If you're lucky like I've been, you'll leave with at least one great bargain in a single visit.  Being a now-you-see-it \/ now-you-don't, snooze-you lose, ever changing overstock \/ buyout concept, I've probably missed out on scads of incredible deals because of my infrequent stops.  You will, too.  So my suggestion is to stop in at least twice a day.  Maybe three.
 
Handbags, however, are my weakness.  I don't have a herd of them---more an   easily controlled bevy or squad.  If you like them, too (like Karyn C's 4 star), this is a destination to include in your travel plans.
    
What looks like close to a thousand (honestly !), they're jam-packed---but neatly and sensibly organized---into a corner near the entrance.  Countless style variations---in a number of materials---seem to fill almost every square foot of available display space.  Like a flourishing overgrown jungle, bags of every sort cover two walls, sit on tiered tables, and hang from large separate triple-rowed rectangular units with endcaps.  Each narrow aisle is like a gauntlet---but a friendly beckoning one---both sides overflowing in totebags, satchels, messengers, crossbodies, hoboes and any other version you can think of, and in nearly any color you can think of.  There's something here for everyone and for every taste---much like department stores.  And like them, too, you'll come across some real stinkers.       

Their vast selection runs from about $20 to $200, with most probably falling in the $30 to $50 range.  I prefer better-quality leather---simply-designed, well-made---and although I've never been the type to be lured like a lemming over that precipitous edge into the world of high-end designers, those Forbes-listers DO seem to have cornered the market on the best hides. 
 
On a recent hunt, my sights were again aimed for Big Game---and I ""bagged"" a winner.  My trophy was a plush and beautifully-constructed...I'll admit it...Ralph Lauren.  From a woven silken green cord looped through a metal gold ring on the bag, and secured by a dime-sized logo button, dangled Ralph's exclusive heavy card-stock RL label, imprinted $268.00   The mass-produced plain utilitarian discounted TJ Maxx tag?---$99.99.  Yay!   ""Better leather and better workmanship"" being a long-time favorite retail mantra, I have another sharp-looking Liz Claiborne that I bought here several years ago.  Probably less than $50 and used many MANY times, that ""old bag"" still looks like new.

I've made other recent purchases here that I was especially pleased with:
~ 100% cashmere scarf...heavier weight, extra long, about 8"" wide ...$20
~  adorable, well-made straw hats ...about $12-$18 
~  Liz Claiborne dress heels...pale pink and almost TOO cute ...about $60
~  8 fake green pears...super-realistic looking...love to decorate with fruit---
.   particularly ones that don't rot or draw flies ...$9 
Over the years, also exceptionally well-discounted:  crystal, sheets, pillow cases, towels, wash cloths, serving bowls, glasses, dinner plates, cups, saucers, and lots of other stuff

The employees here are always friendly, helpful, courteous, and have been able to answer every question I've ever asked them---even ones about Canadian geography, lesser-known Pop Art, and ancient Babylonian politics.    heehee

Apache & Charleston in the Summerlin area, Optic Gallery is a hidden gem to those unaware like myself.  I had recently gone to Lens Crafters for an eye exam...which was covered by my insurance, but unfortunately frames were not...so I had to look elsewhere.  I wont go into details about my good & bad experience with Lens Crafters, however I will tell you about my great experience with Optic Gallery.  Upon doing research online and making a few phone calls with my wife for a respectable place...we came upon Optic Gallery.  

From the appearance outside it was a little intimidating and expensive looking, yet we decided to go in just to browse.  As soon as my wife and I entered, we were promptly greeted by the front desk.  I forgot her name but we asked her about our insurance coverage and how it would work for us.  She answered all my questions and did a print out and gave us Kristy to further help us with making a selection in glasses.  We were amazed at how clean the clinic\/gallery looked.  It wasn't your usual Eye Glass world where things looked like they were not supposed to be placed.  They had a well amount of knowledgeable staff around to help customers. Staff were dressed professionally and clean.  The layout was beautiful and bright...just refreshing!  The place had a spacious waiting room for patients waiting to be seen...and in the backdrop you could see how neat patients files were kept and in order.   We were even offered cold bottles of water from their fridge...I almost thought I was at Desert Toyota Dealership...but boy just that little amenity was a great way to bring a smile to our face and great for a cool-off in this hot Las Vegas summer weather. 

Kristy began by asking us questions in what we were looking for or if we had any idea or previous consultations or prescriptions.  She then began to show us various brands and styles of glasses on display.  Boy they did have a nice selection on hand with various respectable brand names like Ray Ban, Prada, Gucci, Kenneth Cole, Hugo Boss just to name a few.  While helping us browse, she stayed with us practically the whole time, but she did not push any brand or style on me...rather she told me if I liked something we could hold on to them and look more to see if we can find something similar but better.  Kristy was great, she made conversations and jokes and lightened the mood.  My wife and I felt very comfortable and never rushed.  The customer service was great,  Kristy explained everything and even offered options where if we did not find the glasses we like, we could always order something else to be shipped in.  We had that personal one on one service that was outstanding! I couldn't even wait to write a review on Yelp...that my wife and I had complimented Kristy in helping us and being so nice.  She told us that their clinic was built on customer service and making the patient's and customer's experience a wonderful one.  We did find a pair we liked but we wanted to get a color and size that was not in stock, so we had it special ordered.

The prices were reasonable, and in some cases were even cheaper than retail stores such as Lens Crafters.  Optic Gallery didn't even have TAX! Whatever the price was, that was it.  No hidden fees or anything.  When we did settle in to what we wanted, Kristy explained the options we had with lenses, types, anti-glare coatings and what not.  She did not try to sell us anything, but made recommendations and even suggestions in options she felt were not really necessary but had the choice to get what we wanted if we wanted something or not.  We paid for everything...and got a receipt and were told we would be given a call when my glasses come in. 

My wife and I definitely know where to go for our Eye Exams now.  We have seen great reviews for Dr. Young...and look forward for the other half of the great experience at Optic Gallery.  


***NOTE - (I WILL UPDATED THIS ONCE I RECEIVE MY GLASSES)


***UPDATE - Glasses are great, fitment is alright.  My only gripe though is once in a while the screws come loose.  Seems I have to tighten the screws every 3-4 days...otherwise the lens might fall out.  I need to have this check though or get new screws.   I don't blame the customer service for this but hmmm I hope I can do something about this.  I will have to stop by their clinic",Shopping

I am currently a licensed nail stylist with almost 20 years in the beauty industry. I have knowledge in all areas of a salon, from the front of the house to the back. I decided to write this to elaborate on the differences of a walk-in nail salon vs. a specialized nail ""experience"", since there seems to be much confusion of the two.

First off, it is incredibly ignorant to refer to walk-in salons as ""Asian salons"" or ""chop shops"". While it is true most walk-ins are owned and operated by people of Asian descent, this type of description has stigmatized and devalued hard working and incredibly talented people. Quite frankly, there are some downright offensive reviews on walk in nail salons in general, so I truly hope this review is seen and considered.

Walk-In nail salons offer quick and affordable options for people who are budget conscious. Their menus, product, and pricing are no frills and often times, ""a la carte"". A basic pedicure consists of nail shaping, cuticle care, foot filing, massage, and polish application. It is the client's responsibility to ask for add on's such as exfoliation scrub, spa products, and additional massage. The main complaint I see from clients on Yelp is often times they feel add on services have been charged to the bill without their knowledge. My advice is: PAY ATTENTION and ask how much everything will be, before starting the service. 

BE KIND. Yes, we all know how funny Anjelah Johnson's nail shop stand-up routine was, but in reality, it is a hurtful stereotype. Yes, there are language and cultural barriers in a walk-in atmosphere, but it is 2014 in America. If you have not come to terms with these barriers, I'm very sorry to hear that. No, they are not talking about you in their native tongue like you've been conditioned to believe. If anything, they're asking to take a break (considering these people work their asses off 10 hours a day, seven days a week).

Cleanliness and sanitation are virtually the same in both walk-in and ""upscale"" nail salons. Both use soap and water, plus a hospital grade disinfectant (which is tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal aka kills everything) solution for metal tools. For the record, I have worked for a very popular, upscale nail salon in Phoenix who had an on-going roof rat problem which resulted in abnormally large ""flesh flies"" invading the gel lamps. DISGUSTING. But again, sanitation is always an issue for walk-in salons, strictly because of sensationalism, media coverage, and misinformed idiots like Dr. Oz. If you are truly a ""fungiphobe"", go to the nearest Sally Beauty Supply and purchase your own set of tools. Be accountable!

DO YOUR RESEARCH. What is it that you want from a nail service? Vibrating massage chairs? A beautiful retail space? Luxury spa products? Be aware that conceptual nail salons (Nail boutiques, Nail Studio\/Spas, Nail Bars) are popping up everywhere. They are being built to bridge the gap between walk-in and resort experiences. They offer highly stylized spaces, intricate art work, and an edgier appeal. And with that, a heftier price tag. If you ever feel you can ""get a better deal"" at another salon, by all means, go there.. And stay there. No one likes a haggler (or poor tipper, for that matter. If you don't know tipping etiquette, do the right thing and just DIY!!)

Throughout the years at For Nails Only, I have seen Candy, Tina, and now Nick. I visit them when I'm pressed for time and save my upscale experiences for days off. I always let my own clients know that having two places is a good option, specifically if they're on a budget. Each staff member is friendly, remembers you right away (and over time treats you like family) and is beyond kind to clients' kids (who in all honesty, should not be running around a salon). The salon itself is pristine in cleanliness, never stuffy or hot, and has never suffered a rodent infestation thankfully.

The bottom line is know what you want before going on a tirade. Know what to ask for and know who you're dealing with. If you don't know what you want, how do you expect to actually get it? Furthermore, the phrase ""The Customer Is Always Right"" is untrue. Oftentimes the customer is a prejudiced pig who takes pleasure in abusing service industry workers and can't wait to unleash their anger on a public platform. 

Candy and For Nails Only, thank you for twenty years of impeccable service and for inspiring me to get my nail license :) You're truly the best!",Beauty
R3BtgYq48RlxUnBALyBdGw,xFA2VT30iWs3xWFvXFXNLw,SvNzj0dE6UMFfp55bIze_A,2016-03-25,"TL; DR version: Pretty decent if you want pizza and well-sized subs on the cheap. Taste pretty good, but not a lot of bells and whistles. Three stars because I like bells and whistles.   

Actual review: I tried this place for the first time via delivery and ordered 2 buffalo chicken subs, one chicken bacon ranch sub, one steak and cheese sub and a large 3 topping pizza (green peppers, sausage and onions). 

I ordered via Eat24 and the order took about 35-40 minutes to arrive. My order total was $37.52, just shy of $40.00, and fed three hungry teenagers and one adult. Not bad. 

In the spirit of giving a good review, I should disclose that I love food and have  very discerning taste, but unlike other foodie reviewers, I know how to scale it down and keep my reviews relative to the type of food I'm eating. Okay so, bottom line: this is street food. If you're used to artisan pizzas, well seasoned layered sandwiches and fusions galore, then this place may not be for you. However, if you frequently try to eat on the cheap (Little Caesars) because you have kids or you're in college or whatever, then you'll probably appreciate Jimmy's.

Personally, I feel the menu has a pretty decent selection of foods; the pizza is a fair size and price and the sandwiches are large. I'm not big on pizza, but for those of you who prefer minimal marinara , good amounts of cheese and well-sized toppings, you might dig it. Like I said, I'm not into pizza but I actually liked theirs and found myself eating three slices. Not bad. 

What stopped me from giving this place more stars were the sandwiches. I just moved here from dtown Phoenix where we used to order from the Italian Spoon, who offered a variant of subs as a meal with fries and a drink for $7.50. The subs are about 4\/5ths the size of Jimmy's, but they're rich in flavor. Add to that the fact that you get a 8 ounce drink and plenty of fries, you can't help but call that a good deal. Unfortunately, though Jimmy's subs are a pretty good size, I didn't feel mine was that great. I had the Chicken, Bacon and Ranch, and though I felt the sandwich had a hearty amount of chicken and bacon, I found myself put off by how dry the chicken was. I recall ordering this sub specifically for the ranch, and maybe there was ranch on there but I didn't taste it. I don't expect succulent chicken from a street pizza joint, but if they splurged a little on more ranch I probably wouldn't have noticed or cared about dry anything. The bread is a ciabatta type texture, so that mixed with the chicken on each bite added to the dryness. Don't get me wrong, the bread is actually pretty good, but I thought to myself, ""why isn't there at least some shredded lettuce on this?""... ""and maybe a couple slices of tomato?"" I'm just saying it's the little things... If they had hooked that sandwich up with a few more works, they could have squeezed those last two stars out of me, but instead I'm over here kicking myself for not having ranch in my fridge. As a suggestion, when people buy subs, they want loaded, dripping, hot messes filled with that nasty-good stuff (veggies, chili beans, cheese upon cheese upon cheese, BACON, etc). I forgive y'all for not struggling to be excessive, but for $7.50 a sandwich at least throw some ranch and lettuce in there, please. 

You can't beat the pizza price so I'll order again, but tbh I'd give the steak sub a try and will probably pass on the rest from now on.

Update: The steak sub is a lot better :). Thanks for reading.",Restaurant
Eic4tCgDUJaiXwoRAHRuIA,BI-nIs6O-ZwldOaeK6iKIw,-chGaXHZsoLKLHPJMMsdmw,2017-07-28,"This place is not good and I feel terrible giving this restaurant a 1-star rating because that's just a super low blow. I'm sure the chefs, servers and owners are trying their best to keep the business going. I mean, OF COURSE they want the restaurant to succeed, and of course this and that, but at the end of the day, a business is a business so I apologize in advantage for this really negative review. 

I came here with a large group for lunch and I did not expect much, or anything at all. 

Just by looking at their menu, I could tell that this restaurant wasn't the greatest. I personally am not a fan of going to restaurants just to eat overpriced and oily sandwiches, burgers and paninis, especially if they're so deep fried and greasey, but Utopia won the majority vote.  

And here were some questions I had while looking at the menu beforehand: 
1. Why do some of the entrees have the word ""dinner"" in them? Am I NOT supposed to order those items for lunch? So why is it on their lunch menu then? Or is dinner just a fancy word for addressing something as an entree, but it is already under the heading ""entree."" In my opinion, I just think adding the word ""dinner"" to describe a dish is incredibly outdated and reminds me of frozen dinner. I mean DINNER? WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?  
2. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPETIZERS AND STARTERS???
3. There is a typo on the menu. Try to spot it. 

So, why is the rating so low? 

1. As my group went around ordering, about half of the items on the menu were UNAVAILABLE and we got to the restaurant when it just opened! My group of 13 arrived around 11:35 and the restaurant OPENED at 11:30. There were so many unavailable items that it seemed TYPICAL for this restaurant to run out of x or y or z. So, why not take those items out of the menu? Why not focus on perfecting other menu items? A lot of people had to reorder beers, as a group we had to reorder the starters and appetizers (STILL don't know the difference between them. I guess ""starters"" are more for sharing?????), and no surprise, there was an item in the dessert menu that was unavailable. I understand that this is the type of restaurant to only have 2 chefs in the kitchen and maybe their food isn't that good, but it has a patio and it's cheaper than ""nicer"" restaurants and bars, and blah blah blah, but I don't know, it's just not for me. It's about money and time. There are so many bars and restaurants in Toronto, and if I can't get the food I want, then I'll just go somewhere else.  

2. For the ""appetizers"" and ""starters"", we got the chicken karaage, the spanakopita and the mushroom and pesto quesadilla. I really enjoyed the spanakopita, although I did think the spinach was just a little bit under seasoned, but the quesadilla! OH MY GLOB. It just looked unappetizing and when the last quesadilla was left on the plate, no one wanted to eat it because the whole plate was drenched in oil! What the heck?? How much oil do they use and why was it so drenched? 

3. For my main dish, I ordered a veggie burger with avocado, crispy onions, grilled onions, onions, garlic dill mayo and the sriracha mayo. Oh my goodness, I literally just remembered that I asked for jalapeños, but they didn't give me jalapeños. But, the biggest problem was that the whole thing was SO OVERSEASONED. I could barley taste the individual ingredients because it was COVERED with salt and pepper. I could see each individual pepper and salt grains in my food!! My fries were also seasoned to such an extreme and no one else had seasoning on their fries. Inconsistency! The veggie burger itself tasted really bad too, but I couldn't really tell because the shit was so salty and peppery that I was too busy chugging water after each bite. I really think I drank more of their water than eat their food. 

4. Some of their portions were just way too big and I don't think this was a good thing because I saw a lot of food get sent back and inevitably, tossed. Not only would Utopia be losing money, but it is also a waste of food. I don't think it looks good when uneaten food gets returned back to the kitchen. Someone in my group ordered poutine and it was just massive AF and half eaten. A bunch of people only ate half of their sandwiches because the portions were just too big. When portions are too big, people are also less likely to eat them. 

5. Someone mentioned their burger was dry, someone else's panini was really burnt. Someone else got the crab cake dinner and it looked like a bunch of fries and three frozen crab cakes. Someone ordered a shrimp burrito and said the seasoning was weird. JUST UGH!!!  I'm not disappointed, because this is the exact kind of food I'd figured I'd get. 

Some good things about the place? 
1. The atmosphere is nice, I guess. It's really casual. 

TLDR; Not Utopia. If you come here, just come for the spanakopita if they so happen to have it that day.",Restaurant
e7duq6a6qxRf-VhqLCOayQ,Y6rQQJiVHEn_SuScZzJSxg,gw6aVsdno8U8DEl0F404fg,2010-02-18,"Ready to pack my bags and start my new life as a fly on the wall in this fantastic establishment I stumbled upon completely by accident. It all started when 2 non-yelpers (the nerve!) and I were a touch under the weather (re: hungover) and driving around aimlessly looking for a place to have a boozy brunch up in North Phoenix. It was literally by the grace of God that we were brought to Gino's. According to my GPS, we had arrived at Ollie's Omlette House. After our retarded asses drove around an empty complex for god knows how long, we finally all agreed upon the fact that Ollie's Omlette house was no more and Gino's had taken it's place. No longer willing to drive another foot, we decided to walk in to Gino's and give it a shot.

How freakin pumped were we that we did?!? I'm actually going against my better judgment even telling you about the goldmine that is Gino's, because at first I was tempted to keep this treasure trove all to my greedy little self. However, in the spirit of Yelp, I've decided to share.

Upon first glance of Gino's, it looks like a little beat up diner with a bunch of New York paraphernalia scattered all over the walls in the most depressingly dead shopping complex I have ever seen. I'm talking closed store after closed store after closed store. Thankfully, the depressing exterior dissipates the second you walk in. The entire staff is laughing, joking around, coming over to the tables and sharing their war stories from the night before, friendly as all hell and straight up hilarity.

The prices were retarded cheap. My entire breakfast, which consisted of eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast was $3.99. Three freakin dollars and 99 cents!! Cheaper than Denny's\/IHOP and other look alikes...oh, and I could order a big fat cocktail with it. Not beer, not wine, liquor baby. WIN!!!

Upon further examination, I saw that they had insane specials like my breakfast going on every single day\/night of the week. Like Thursday night Ladies Night which consists of $1 you call-its for the ladies. Be honest, how long has it been since you've heard of a bar doing dollar you call-its?? A long ass time, that's for sure. But that's not where it ends. I want to say Monday night was some crazy thing like $3.99 all you can eat pasta and Wednesday nights were $7.99 half rack of ribs night or something ludicrous like that.

The best part of this all, even better than the rock bottom food and drink prices, was that the food was actually pretty darn tasty and the drinks were poured STRONG! The owner Gino came over and hung out and shot the shit with us for a while during our brunch, telling us about a couple parties he's hosted there, including NYE where he provided transportation to and from the bar for every single patron, regardless of where they live and completely free of charge. How's that for some old-fashioned hospitality? 

I am calling it now. This is my new Cheers. This bar\/restaurant embodies everything I feel like most places I frequent lack. Good people, good food, good drinks all at a price I can actually afford?? I always thought places like this were just rumor and too good to be true, but Gino's, you've made a believer out of me.",Restaurant

But the bread was delicious; the salad fresh with just the right amount of dressing, and crispy croutons, and the coffee refills were a perfect addition to the warm bread.

 The Good

The ambiance is lovely-modern, classy and clean
They will accommodate a large group
They kept refilling our coffee and bread
The bread was amazing-warm with fresh butter on the side-so good! And I am not even a bread person!
The coffee was also amazing!--I am a coffee person :)
This time around the steak was cooked to perfection
The frites had just the right amount of seasoning and were crispy on the outside and pillowy in the inside
Loved the addition of the butter on the steak-gave it that extra kick of flavor

The Not-So-Good

Disliked the desserts the first time around, and we all disliked it the 2nd time. Yes, you can substitute the dessert, but we disliked them all. In comparison to their mains, the desserts needed work. Which is odd since they are doing such an amazing job with the bread! 

At the end of dinner one of our waiters approached me and asked me if my friends and I only like to eat out if the meal is cheap? What kind of question was that? It was not only rude, but he also insulted the restaurant he works for by implying that they are cheap! Wow!

My dessert was missing an element, and when I asked the chef he told me he was going to get it for me-I told him I was going to take my dessert to-go, so I asked that he include it in the to-go container. On my way out I checked the to-go container and the missing piece was not in the box. I asked the chef again and he told me that they had run out. Was he going to tell me at all, or was he waiting for me to get home to find the piece missing? Personally I thought that was sneaky and unprofessional. If you can't deliver, then step-up and admit it.

In Sum

Though there were many hits, the overall experience left a lot to be desired... being called cheap, average desserts, and sneaky behaviour killed the experience for me. And no, I don't only go out for ""cheap"" meals! The nerve!

xfWi4Efa6U2Ux0jTzqebrg,ex1ypGlvo2OiNhSDzWSDGQ,lwC0U4xU7T2qyCBRmrWFXQ,2009-04-15,"This is the store that will make you say, as it did my friends and me, ""We've died and gone to retail heaven.""  Here's the recap of our experience, along with some tips for your visit:

- Come physically prepared. Wear lightweight, tight-fitting clothing, preferably with ""wicking"" capability, as it does get hot there. My friends and I joked that ""We could either hike Machu Picchu or go to Last Chance."" We came prepared with Clif bars and watched our water intake. We didn't want to use the bathroom (which we didn't, for six hours -- a new record). We left our purses at home.  

- Arrive early. We arrived about an hour and a half before the store opened, and we were not the first people there!  The store now opens at 10 a.m. When we arrived, there was a small gathering of people, as well as some merchandise on special. There were lots of cute skirts for $2.50 (including a Michael Kors skirt that I can wear to work, except for the broken zipper, which I fixed myself). At around 9:15, people started to crowd very close to the store gates.  Veteran shoppers told us everything we needed to know and pointed out which other ""regulars"" were ""aggressive"" and how we shouldn't run in the store. The veteran shoppers turned out to be a highlight of the trip; they seemed to take pride in showing novices the ropes, and they made sure to check in on us during the day. 

- Follow directions. At 10 a.m. the store manager (Mary?) made a few generic announcements and told us not to run once we got inside (see a pattern?). Then a woman appeared in front of the gate. She told us she would be our ""pacer"" and we could not run in front of her on our way to receive a ticket to enter the ""designer purse"" room. The gate lifted, and I could feel my heart pounding, just like it did before my high school cross-country races years ago. Suddenly, we were in the store, walking as quickly as we could to grab a raffle ticket that would enable us to enter that special room. Although I was a good eight inches taller than most of the women and men there, my friends reminded me that the shorter ladies can be feisty -- and they were!  Once I entered the store, I spent about five minutes with the elbow of a petite woman stuck firmly into my ribs as she used my body to propel herself forward, all the while shouting to anyone who would listen, ""Look, look!"" to signal my supposedly inappropriate body-checking (yes, I remember a thing or two from middle school basketball). Before we knew it, we received our raffle tickets, the elbow was gone, and we began shopping.

- Grab a basket. Note that these are little baskets like the kind you have for 10 items or less in the grocery store. You'll want to take the clothes off the hangers so you can stuff more into your basket. You should take advantage of the mirrors throughout the store to periodically cull your basket and try on certain items. 

- Be discerning. I was really surprised by the incredible selection -- I am currently wearing my $6 dress (which I saw and almost bought at Nordstrom Rack this fall for about $80). Ann Taylor sweaters were $6, shorts were $5, tights were $1, and I bought a France Luxe headband for $1 (normally $18). One friend bought Kenneth Cole shoes for $30 (normally $150). The selection was also impressive: bathing suits, formal dresses, kids' clothes, men's clothes, jewelry, scarves, bags, and coats. 

- Check out the purse room. After we had been shopping for about an hour, Mary started calling our raffle ticket numbers. We went in groups of five, for five minutes, to a small closet-sized room with slightly stained\/used designer bags. The rule was you could only touch two purses and one wallet. Once the five-minute mark passed, you had to put the purses down. It was a little weird, and the selection wasn't that good. Still, the whole experience was fun.

- Be ready to try on clothes. The dressing rooms are communal (one Yelp reviewer has reminded shoppers to ""wear undies""), but my friends and I scored single dressing rooms. Make sure you count your items when you go inside, and keep track of your basket if you have more than 10. 

- Lines, and other miscellaneous details. Shopping here on a Saturday morning\/early afternoon worked well for us; lines moved quickly. My biggest tip, even though it sounds a little obsessive, is to keep checking areas you've already checked. In the eleventh hour, and by ""eleventh,"" I mean sixth, I found the aforementioned Michael Kors skirt and a beautiful butter yellow leather bag that were most certainly NOT on the rack the first time.   

All in all, I'm ready to go back!  This place was definitely worth the hype and the plane fare from San Francisco. I'm sold!",Shopping
u8vpPpWn5ZOhT2FL2grByg,lw9bMS39hvR3KB8hHk-clA,IWKtGvVg4hqc9rWHjW8KoA,2014-06-17,"Currently at M Resort. Checked in with my four kids, cousin visiting from Idaho and her teenage son on 6\/16.  

First of all, I was super excited about this place. Mostly very high reviews for stay and food on both Yelp and Tripadvisor. I care most about plush surroundings, value, and food. I chose M Resort based on a few key factors not in order of importance: 

1.  Big plush hotel for my money cause I've got kids and we don't like the smell of smoke and I'm big on decor and comfort and my usual hotel Mandalay was $400+ this visit. First moment we walked in, we were hit with a wall of smoke. I would say almost as smoky as a Harrah's in Reno. My first thought was WTH? The ceiling is high, why is their such bad ventilation?? It was bothersome and continues to bother me. Rooms are perfectly smoke free smelling, though.  I think I would have left if they weren't.  Rooms are very nice. Beds are plush and firm. Bathrooms are big and spacious. Rooms were very clean. Kids loved the automatic shades on windows and bathtub window. They only had three towels in each bathroom so I had to ask for more. TV in bathroom is useless as you can't see it from the view of the tub. I got a good price with the CA discount. Super happy about that and the reservation lady told me wifi was included. Yay!! Saved me $15\/day right there on top of 30% discount. Of course, when I got here and kids said they were receiving a notice of charges on their phones, wifi was NOT included. I called downstairs and man said nope, not included with CA residents discount. Ugh.  Not helpful or apologetic about it. Not happy about that at all. I even confirmed when I made reservations last month after lady told me that there were no resort fees (double yay!) by saying ""so when I get there, there are no other fees I have to pay even for wifi access?""  She said it's all included in the room. Booooo!

2.  Buffet was supposed to be awesome...it was $150 for my family of 7 (5 adults as I have 3 kids over 9, 1 six year old, and 1 free 4 year old) for dinner.  We were there at 4pm. Wait was like waiting for a ride at Disneyland. Loooong (1 hour). Don't go downstairs to Studio B Buffet when you're really hungry as we did. My kids were tired and starving by the time we got our table. But it made for a lot of food to be eaten. Buffet was just okay. I tried a lot of different things. Prime Rib was phenomenal. May be better than House of Prime Rib in SF. Yup I said it! Cream of Mushroom Soup was very good. Everything else was okay....pork ribs, stuffing, pasta salads, Cajun shrimp, fried shrimp, egg rolls, Mac n cheese, crab legs were mushy and tasteless, rest mentioned above was just okay. I'm a foodie and I don't like to waste food at all. But I felt like I needed to eat hella and get whatever just to get my money's worth and I never do that.  We will try the breakfast tomorrow and see how that goes.  

3.  Pool for kids. I didn't want to stay on the strip since I have little kids with me this trip and Vegas pools are more oriented for drunk 20yr olds. I didn't want my kids bothering them and I didn't want them bothering my kids fun. M Resort looks to have a big beautiful pool and as it's away from the strip, it's more ""family oriented"". Pool was closed cause of winds. No problem. We'll try tomorrow (and cabanas are only $250!) Can't help the weather and I'd prefer they keep us safe so yay for M resort for that one. 

4.  Customer Service...HERE IS where they EXCEL. Having worked in CS and being a hotel snob, I know and appreciate this service the most. Christy checked us in promptly and sweetly. Took all of 4 minutes. She was polite and personable.  Asked about my stay. Told them it was for my birthday, but I checkout that day. Within minutes of arriving to my room someone brings me up a red velvet cupcake with a birthday card from Christy. How friggin sweet!!

Called Housekeeping for more towels and pillows. Erica was very nice and accommodating. Came quick and man delivering it was also polite. 

When we were at Studio B, our waiter was great with the kids, good at cleaning up the table, and great at refilling our drinks. Super nice even though they were obviously crazy busy (more from less servers than a lot of customers, but it was an early dinner so understandable).  I didn't get his name. Filipino guy working tables next to the Mediterranean food area. I felt less jaded by the quality of the food because of the customer service. Also, young prime rib carver guy was nice and gave me the precise cuts I asked for. 

Aside from the lack of concern from Front Desk when I called about wifi -which I assume was because he thought I was just trying to get out of paying for it- customer service here so far is stellar. 

Right now the stay is okay, not living up to what I expected. I'm placated a lot by the great staff. Hopefully tomorrow the pool will bring on the happy feelings! I'll update if needed. Thanks for reading!",Beauty
ev_-x0q1wztR1Lus9ozIHA,HvQ576LJm6i6QZuTwl7WVg,6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ,2013-04-04,"Seeing so many Thai restaurants with a mixture of extremely positive and negative reviews, I was a little anxious about booking anywhere. I am a student with a limited budget, so eating out is an occasion (here a reward for having finished all my assignments), and the Thai restaurant I chose had to be a very good one.

I looked at about 5 other places in town. Some were too expensive, some didn't offer enough in the way of veggie food, others were just too far away. I was considering a takeaway, when I suddenly noticed for the first time ever the Celadon which is just across the road from me. I can literally just cross the road and I'm on the doorstep. The next task was to check it was okay online. Yelp and other sites all pointed in the same direction: ""top notch"" and ""entirely faultless"" service, delicious authentic food and good value. Being so close, I had to check it out.

The menu is deceptive. It doesn't look very vegetarian, but it turns out they are willing to vegetarianize just about everything on the menu, are conscious about dietary problems and don't use shrimp paste! Yay!

I booked for 7.30 today. Before 8pm from Monday-Thursday there is a pre-theatre menu, where you get a starter and a main for £12.99. Upon entering we noticed  that the place was pretty empty, there was just one other couple eating. We put this down to the out of the way location, but after half an hour it suddenly filled up! The interior is minimalist and tastefully decorated, nothing too intrusive. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. 

My boyfriend ordered from the pre-theatre menu: spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce, pad thai with tofu. I ordered a green curry with tofu and thai sticky rice. My boyfriend Robbie thought his starter was a bit small, but very much enjoyed it and his main made up for the small starter size. His pad thai came with the peanuts and various spices on the side (to sprinkle over the noodles), and a small salad. He said it was delicious, but after tasting some of mine he looked jealously at my dish every so often. Mine was super spicy, with plenty of red chillies in the sauce, fragrant herbs and spices, big chunks of fried tofu and plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables. My rice came in a bamboo bag which was used to steam it. The portion size was massive, but it was so good that I ate more or less everything. 

Thai puddings are amongst my favourites. Robbie opted for the banana fritter with coconut ice cream, whilst I went for the banana cooked in sweet coconut milk. Strangely enough, this is a quite nostalgic dish for me as I used to eat it a lot when I went out for dinner with my grandparents. It is relatively healthy in comparison to other dessert options, and really rather delicious. The presentation of both pudding was really beautiful, and Robbie wolfed his pudding down despite having declared he was stuffed a few seconds before. He added that it was the best part of the meal... 

For £30 for two without drinks, it wasn't that expensive. I am not sure why Thai is always pricier than other places, but Celadon is cheaper than most but definitely superior to most. Fresh ingredients are well cooked, service is, as Emily H stated, ""flawless"". I would definitely come back here to sample some of the other dishes on offer.",Restaurant

      We were seated promptly and greeted by our waitress, Robin, who took our drink orders and quickly rattled of the specials. I'm not sure how special these dishes actually are though, as Robin had every dish and all it's ingredients memorized, and boredly pushed through the list of dished forcefully without pausing for breath- or any questions. Upon being ask for my order, i told the waitress that i wanted the Seared Tuna with Jalapeno and Garlic Chips (listed under ""Koi Signature dishes""), which she promptly and condescendingly told me was an appetizer. A bit taken aback, i asked her to go around the table for everyone else's order before coming back to me. After debating my options for a minute, my sister convinced me to just get it because appetizer portions are usually somewhat larger and we could share it(- plus, who gives a shit what the waitress thinks). I looked up and the waitress was nowhere to be seen...she returned ten minutes later, only after my sister flagged her down and pointed out that she forgot to take my order before prancing off. Finally having wrangled her, i asked what the portion size was for the Seared Tuna and made a point of saying that i was going to split it as my main course. She hummed and hawed, but was not very specific or attentive to what i was asking: She basically said ""yeah, fine"", wrote the order down and left. 
      Waiting around for the food, i enjoyed the atmosphere and music. The place is really nice and very classy. glancing around, I look toward the sushi bar and notice a waitress trying to unplug a bottle of Sriracha and squirt it onto a plate. Now, i love me some Sriracha but i would not say that it is an especially gourmet chili sauce, and found it somewhat disheartening to witness it being squirted all over a dish they charge $30 for. In retrospect i think this scene basically sums up my experience and Koi LV. 
      The food arrives, and Robin the waitress hands me my plate- It is sparingly covered by 5 or 6 tiny thin pieces of tuna, each with one chunk of raw jalapeno and a few flakes of what was apparently dried garlic. To recap: The dish i ordered was called Seared Tuna with Jalapeno and Garlic Chips. Having ordered seared tuna in several restaurants before, and being a regular sushi eater, i was expecting sashimi-sized chunks of fish with a good sear on each side. These pieces of fish were basically 1x2 inch slices of deli meat style tuna...it was so thin it was see through. As a result, the fish did not retain any kind of sear or the typically steak-y taste and texture of traditionally seared tuna. The fish itself was of mediocre quality and the only dominant flavor in the dish was the jalapeno, which would have been more successful had it been diced and evenly distributed on the fish rather than in a chunk right in the middle. Furthermore, the exceedingly small portion was not large enough for one person to eat as a meal, let alone for two people to share like we asked, and certainly not worth the $16+ we were charged for it...I. was. pissed. - and apparently it was written on my face because the waitress hurriedly asked if i needed something, to which i replied that i felt extremely misled by the information she gave us about the dish.   She tried to argue that all sashimi came in ultra-thin deli slices like that(!), but i was not having it. She then tried to push me to order something else until i told her that i did not intend to spend any more money for shitty service and tiny amounts of mediocre food. 
      At this point i think i should mention that with parties of 8 or more they charge a 19% gratuity fee. I feel this is extremely relevant to my experience, and the experience of the other people in my party because it was very much one of those cases where, knowing that the gratuity fee is there, the person waiting on you does a totally lame job because they don't have to work for their tip. Very uncool. We all agreed that our server was pushy, condescending, and basically did a half assed job the entire time...and she still left with a $90 tip- wtf
      I should also point out that my dish was not the only one that was determined by my party to be of inadequate portion size and quality-especially in relation to the price we were paying for it. 
      Also, several people said they thought it was weird that they used crappy wasabi paste rather than the real\/good stuff. 
      Of the things i tried and liked, I'd recommend the Creamy rock shrimp tempura, Tiger roll, Chicken Yakitori, and Tempura Shrimp Roll- All of which were of good or exceptional quality and portion size. 

Final thoughts: Head to Koi if you love lame sushi and hate your money.",Restaurant
YK-qIhMY4CFpRPEHD_db7w,O7a4UENWfulCaKeK88rKWg,zyPGYeXF4XKCqNN1pjFWhg,2017-04-05,"Just know that I was on the fence for a 3 or 4 Star review. I was meeting my family\/friends for a nice birthday dinner. I made a reservation, read, researched, and bought a groupon for secondary insurance ;-)  This building has been so many random places including the Sugar Shack so I was very impressed with the remodel. It is a beautiful, Modern, but cozy place...well done! My party arrived early, 5:30 for a 6:15 reservation and the initial reaction to the service at the bar from them was ""she really couldn't be bothered"". This is coming from a couple who worked in the food service industry and a well loved retired bartender of 30 plus years in an upscale restaurant.  That put me a little back on my heels to start. The hostess was pleasant to me and they gave us a great booth in the corner where you can see the whole restaurant. Highly recommend 5 star seating. Now, I almost feel sorry for the girl because one could tell she was so new at the job in general, but her awkwardness and lack of general menu knowledge was painful for us all. I understand we all have to start somewhere, but expectations for service in general is pretty high for Scottsdale. 2.5 or 3 stars because she tried. We all had drinks including the blueberry Basil mule(refreshing), IPA, and some Titos...loved the glassware tubs for drinks!  For dinner, we started with Arugula Salad and Mixed greens, very fresh and yummy but a tad small. My gluten free girl asked about gluten free bread. I realize that this may be high maintenance but it is a fact of life that people are eating this way...for purposes I may not always agree with or embrace myself. That being said, her comment to me was based on her lifestyle. ""To be a relevant restaurant these days, you almost have to offer gluten free options, like bread"" I had the Grilled Branzino and it was perfect! I had a salad so the portion was awesome for me with the roasted cauliflower only.  But, maybe throw a tablespoon or two of rice on the plate for giggles so the 200lb guy on my right feels like he got his $$ worth.  The others got scallops, meh, with risotto...not a fan in general but tasted like mac n cheese while much richer and a bit over salted. And Saffron Risotto, which I declined to taste, but they said it was good but a little bland, go figure. And the Pork chop, which again I didn't taste but that got a thumbs up. For dessert, and we ordered the Tiramisu. I am not a dessert person but ugh...I almost cringe to write this. The overall opinion was ""worst Tiramisu ever"".  Now, I know all this is for the most part is not a good review but I believe in second chances and I will go back for another shot because personally,  my food was great. I am thinking brunch or happy hour when I drink more than I eat. I think they did a beautiful job making this space inviting so maybe a few tweaks to the staff training and closer watch on the menu prep... this place could be great! .",Restaurant
AkoK4SKwFAl9NcHbRteR3A,l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,ZaInbO5g--yHzrwts6_4xQ,2011-06-27,"I've been shopping at this Albertsons since the day they opened, and they are as solid and earnest business now as that very first day. I'd shrug and say, ""It's an Albertsons,"" but having visited a few other stores around town where the security-guard presence is a bit more obvious, the aisles less varied, and the store less clean, I have new appreciation for the ship-shape Albertsons being run here.

In the 89139-zone we have three players: Albertsons, Smith's, and Glazier's. (Oh, fine, and Vons, too, but I don't count them. Don't get me started) I have to admit that Glazier's is my top choice for groceries. Nothing against Albertsons, but it's hard to beat Glazier's (for reasons which eventually shall be detailed in a separate review). 

Still, often I drop by Albertsons. Partially because it's convenient, and partially because their Sav-On pharmacy staff is so quick, friendly, and helpful. Until I met them, I thought pharmacists with personality who really look at you as a person they can help, not just another pill bottle to fill, no longer existed. (And I've lived in folksy small towns with soda counter drugstores and everything.)

To be fair, the people across the corner at CVS are also very competent and nice and deserve the silver medal behind Sav-On's gold. (Sav-On regrettably had to send me to CVS one time when they ran out of a pill I needed that night. But Sav-On made the calls and got my prescription all set up with CVS before I even left their counter. I visited CVS again later when I had a late-night pneumonia issue. Long story. Still, great as that CVS is, I'll bother to make the left turn to Sav-On, given the choice.) 

There's just a little extra something about the kind people at Sav-On. They remember me, which is nice, if happily startling. They remember little details about my drug history, which is reassuring. And they always know the answers to my questions straight away, which I like best of all.

Plus, at Sav-On I can shop while I wait for my prescription to be filled (not that there's ever much wait). (At CVS, you're stuck sitting in the massage chair and leaning away from the coughers, or else you have to pace the short aisles over and over, feigning in interest in elbow braces or something.) 

This Albertsons has a decent international aisle with Asian (Thai, Japanese, some Chinese) and Western European (German, UK) items. Indian food (limited) is (inexplicably) kept on the rice aisle. The Hispanic foods section is the usual fare - although no watermelon-flavoured Jarritos like you can get at some Albertsons. (But heck, even Mariana's and Cardenas don't sell those.)

The bread is hot (as advertised) and the bakery sees enough traffic that extremely fresh bread is easier to come by than at other local supermarkets. Don't look for many markdowns in this department. Most of the good clearance items can be found in one of the end freezer cases (just as you reach the shampoo aisle), and there's another clearance section back by the bathrooms. (The bathrooms have always been clean, if cramped.)

My husband shops at the butcher counter now and again and always gets friendly service. If you're looking for the friendliest guy in the store, though (aside from the pharmacy - no one can beat them), it's the man who looks after the self-checkouts. (The store has four open except for the wee hours.)

I think the only poor experience we've had with food from Albertsons has been their roasted chickens. They're consistently half-cooked in appearance: crispy on one side, slimy and white on the other. As a vegetarian, I'm just a bystander, but my husband went to the bother to return one before he discovered that they're *all* like that, and subsequent trips have only offered the same. Counter staff couldn't see the problem, so maybe that's just how they're supposed to be.

Lines are never an issue. (Vons, take note!) The store has a few Redbox kiosks (one in, one out), and a photo kiosk as well. The pharmacy has a drive-thru. Wipes for sanitizing the cart are available about 75% of the time. Handbaskets are available at each entrance. (Not every Albertsons offers them at all now.) The Starbucks is right by the door. Mexican Coke and Pepsi (real sugar, glass bottle) are featured items. You can refill water bottles out front. There used to be a terrific bagel place across the parking lot (salt bagels - too rare!), but the economy happened. Sorry. Otherwise, an Italian yogurt\/crepe\/waffles place (Cefiore) is the ""fun spot"" to lure you into the strip mall.

Overall, I give 4.5 stars to the pharmacy (with a little dock because I wish they were open 24\/7 or at least late) and 3 stars to the store, which is dependable without offering anything extraordinary. Alas, I can't give the whole shebang four stars, not with Glazier's down the road and Sunflower not far away, but this is the kind of three-star supermarket that you can count on for an everyday, pleasant shopping experienc",Shopping
hihd1OW8ZMn83k4n8Bv0Eg,Y7EkNdRl_WCML9zo9lw1nw,jJoPLIhCjkGXy59I4Jl6zw,2017-08-13,"My family came into town last week to visit and we came here for a week staycation with my parents and adult siblings so I didn't have to host at my house and we could order cocktails at the pool rather than sneaking drinks into my community pool. I wrote this review while we were staying here and was hoping that someone might reach out to help improve our stay, but sadly no one did. I'm a platinum elite member with the pretty room key card for recognition, but past the $250 credit I got from staying at Marriot 20 some times a year, the trip just got worse and worse. 

We headed over when my parents and siblings got into town and they wanted early check in so they could avoid the traffic coming into town. The room was supposed to be ready at 11am. It wasn't which wasn't a huge deal, but they said it would be a 30 minute wait so I headed over to get our weekend started. Once an hour had passed and no one came by to say the room was ready (they told the staff where we would be while we waited) they said the room was ready, but pending a manager walk through which would take about 30 minutes to complete. I got tired of the wait so I went home for a couple hours and my parent didn't call for another hour after I left when they finally got their room at 2pm. The day was already over by then and a monsoon was about 2 hours away, so we gave up on the pool. 

If you saw my previous post, the pool wasn't anything to be excited about and I see a couple reviews that say the guests got infections from the pool a couple of weeks before we went. We did not get any infections, but I bet it was from another batch of kids with parents who weren't watch that were gathering water from the pond(ish thing, it got bigger from the monsoons) and pouring it on other guests and into the pool water. Tip for the hotel maintenance: throw some more chlorine in the water, please! There was one staff member who was trying her best to keep the children under control, but I remember getting pushes by a group of 8-10 year old boys who were yelling ""SWIM FASTER, SHE'S GAINING ON US!"". I was mildly annoyed the first time thinking they were just playing with their siblings and not being self-aware of the splashing because they were caught up in the fun, but my annoyance grew when I saw a staff member come by seconds later threatening to call security and those kids never got thrown out of the pool even hours later after getting even worse.

They have this new thing where you can opt out of daily turndown service and they automatically assumed we wanted that when we were never asked about it. Like I said in my previous review, I go on vacation to be lazy and as I mentioned above I came here to not have to host and clean rooms after everyone left. For 50 extra points (that is nothing) I do not want to make my own bed and miss out on my nightly pillow chocolate. After going down to the lobby and expressing my frustration, they acted sorry and even sent up a bottle of wine (it was a $30 bottle on vinepair), but they didn't make the change to the system so the next day I had to go back down and hope that they got it right that time (they did, thankfully). After not having a made bed for 3 days and being frustrated while trying to relax a $30 bottle was more of an inconvenience when it piled up in the room trash can that hadn't been emptied in days. Even when the turn down service was in place I felt that they weren't ready to accommodate that basic service and it took them about 3 hours to get to our room. I think they just don't want to hire more staff so they are trying to sneak it past you to save on their operational costs. 

While I'm complaining (I feel like I sound whiney at this point, but I'm just putting it all out there), they kept the A\/C in the hallways at about 80 degrees. I live in AZ and keep my house at 80 degrees during the weekdays, but there are two of us. A hallway filled with people gets toasty when the A\/C is at 80 and I would be sweating by time I got to the ground floor which was always a nice 70 degrees.

Honestly, I think this place is just cutting corners to keep costs down between the one lonely and overworked staff member at the pool enforcing rules on a weekend, the A\/C temp in the hallways, and the lack of cleaning staff. I'd rather they charge me a higher rate and make the place nicer. This is a JW Marriot after all. In all fairness, I'm from Laguna so when I think of Marriot I automatically get pictures of the Laguna Cliffs Marriott in my head, but this place was nothing in comparison. I was expecting that the lower cost was because we are in Scottsdale where property is 1\/3 of the cost of Laguna Beach, but I was paying half the cost and getting half the service which makes no sense when you take that into account.",Beauty

Being born and raised here, I've been coming to the Ranch House for as far back as I remember. When I was younger, this was one my mom and stepdads favorite places to go for a steak. I remember when there used to be long waits and lines out the door. But I can't remember when exactly I was here last, I just know it's been a good 15+ years.

A few of our friends recently invited us here for dinner when they were craving some ""good ole' American meat"". When the 5 of us walked in on a Saturday night, there was absolutely no wait. There was a few tables sat inside, and while the decor has remained mostly unchanged from what I remember, the place just doesn't seem to have that Ranch House feel anymore. It's definitely starting to show it's age, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it almost feels more like a chain restaurant now than a mini-getaway from the city like it used too.

After browsing the menu for a bit, I decided on a special that there were advertising, a bacon-wrapped 8oz filet, I believe priced at about $35. Much like the regular menu items, it came with a soup or salad, and a potato choice. I chose the lobster bisque, which wasn't great, but according to other reviewers, was likely a lot better than their side salad. It just didn't really have much flavor, and there was no lobster in it. The best part about it was dipping their garlic cheese toast in it, which on it's own wasn't anything special either. 

Now, I'm the type of person who doesn't believe in eating a steak at anything past medium rare...and with no shame, I'll give you a hard time about doing so. But I think when I ordered my filet medium rare, and just about everyone else at the table ordered there's well done, it threw the kitchen off a little bit. All 4 of our steaks were just off a bit. Mine was cooked much closer to medium, and the well done orders were more like medium rare. Not that I feel too bad for them, since they won't be able to taste anything way, it's always disappointing when your steak isn't done right. Especially mine being over medium rare. 

Even though I still think the Ranch House uses fairly good quality meat, especially at the price, their execution just isn't there. Alongside the temperature issues, our steaks came with a béarnaise sauce that pretty much ruined the whole thing. It was easily the thickest béarnaise sauce I've ever seen, and had a texture that was more like a dry paste squeezed out of a pastry bag. There was no smoothness to it, it wasn't creamy, and it really didn't taste all that good. Scraping as much of it off as I could helped a bit, but this would have been an entirely different experience if that sauce wasn't there to begin with. 

There service doesn't have much behind it either. We felt really rushed with our orders, and it took a while to get drink refills too. Our waitress was okay, but she wasn't very friendly, and didn't seem all that interested in waiting tables anymore that night. 

Maybe nostalgia kicks in a little on this 3 star review, just because I like the place and have been here so many times before as a kid. And as I mentioned, I still don't think their prices are too crazy high for the quality of meat. But the service and kitchen execution resemble more of an Outback or other chain. I might go back eventually, but if it's anything like this last visit, and they've completely lost that homey, local feel with decent steaks to go along with it, the Ranch House would be all but a memory.",Restaurant

I was on a mission at Drug Mart that would turn out to be apocalyptic.  Compelled to see it through to the end, nothing was going to stop me from accomplishing my objective despite the wide array of intriguing, confusing, sometimes head-scratching diversions along the way.  On arrival, I chose my craft.  Good.  Not too wobbly or pulling hard to one side.  Before pushing off, I reviewed my list---pastrami (4 star), salami (5 star) (both Eckrich---great sale prices), old-style 60W light bulbs (rare, nearing extinction), yellow highlighters, and plastic twist-tie gallon storage bags.  I was ready---and for anything else that might catch my eye.  Commencing my journey, I headed up-aisle with a wall of medicinals and oral hygiene products starboard.  Navigating one way, then another, I loaded the intended items along my serpentine route, mooring occasionally as other curiosities caught my interest.  All these distractions weren't blotting out why I was here---the real reason.  

I was here to get shot.  With whatever ammunition was being used---be it Afluria, Fluarix, Fluzone, or other---so I wouldn't contract some dreaded malignant flu bug.  The lunchmeat and plastic diversions were provisions I needed anyway, and the few unexpected oddities I momentarily studied only heightened the realization of the true purpose of this operation.  One which wouldn't be delayed much longer. 

Cruising down-aisles, up-aisles, and side-aisles, I moved swiftly along narrow passages---at times requiring slower, more cautious maneuvering in order to avoid step stools, mechanical lifting apparatus, point-of-purchase displays, and smiling employees re-stocking.  I sailed past innumerable products in a full spectrum of colors---hanging from hooks, lined along shelves, in boxes, bottles, and bags. Some items seemed to dart at me, coming into sharper focus.  I'd pull over and examine them further.  Then, above the shoppers' din, ""dah-dah...dahdah-DAH-DAH-DAH-DAH-dahdah.....dah-dah...dahdah-DAH-DAH-DAH-DAH-dahdah...I can't GET no satisFACtion...I can't GET no girlie ACtion...and I TRIED...""  I hummed along to myself as I rode the waves of commercial grade flooring past shiny glossy colorful cosmetics, vibrant splashes of red, pink, and glitter in a stretch of Valentine cards, varied necessities and non-necessities, school supplies and garden supplies, furnace filters, and toe nail fungus ointments.  There it was in the distance---just beyond an end cap.  Reducing speed, filled with expectation, I rolled toward my final destination---the pharmacy.

About 12 hours later...
A sharp pain---excruciating, stabbing---awakened me in the middle of the night.  Had I just had a nice size chunk of flesh torn from my arm by some wild rabid creature that had managed to gnaw and claw its way through a foundation crack, and crawl right into my bed?  Quickly sitting straight up like a mattress spring, my eyes wide open unblinking, all was still and silent, and really really REALLY dark---like pitch---except for my new L.L.Bean alarm clock glowing 2:23 or thereabouts.  Oh, how I wanted this to be a nightmare, but it wasn't.  It was too real, unmistakably intensely real---throbbing pulsating agony.  Was it possible my arm was just hanging from my shoulder by a thick twisted thready sinew?  THE HORROR !  THE HORROR !  

Surrounded in blackness where the terrifying thing could be lying in wait, hidden from my sight and poised to fling itself at my face, I slowly reached for my surely tattered arm with my free trembling hand.  Owwch!  It was still attached.  Phew.  Then it must be badly infected, probably hideously discolored, too!  Now it's official.  I'm panicked.  Madly stripping the bandaid off on my way, the sudden harsh illumination from the bathroom globes confirmed it looked quite normal in the mirror.  Healthy, even. Yikes!  What was THIS all about.  If I HAD been dreaming, I would have been in the peak stage of the Black Death.  I grabbed the ""Intra-muscular Vaccine"" handout sheet and tried to read it.  The blurry words---I was probably not 100% awake yet---appeared to be in some foreign language.  I couldn't recognize what I'm certain were letters and characters we're all accustomed to seeing.  A's, R's, #'s, even *'s.  After a couple of high-dose painkillers to knock myself out, I'd try again when I came to.

They have a lot of awesome sounding live music outside. Speaking of which, their outside patio area very spacious, and really cool looking for it to be so simplified. 

The inside atmosphere, to me, is more sports bar, rather than the ""biker bar"" type of places they kind of pretend to be. They do have a motorcycle body hanging from the ceiling and the flyers and decorations around the room are biker oriented, but really, it's more sporty.

They have a lot of tvs and one of the factors that make them unique, or so I'm told, is that they play every NFL game. 

Another positive is the beer variety. They have a HUGE selection to choose from and if you love trying new things like I do, you are bound to find some new beers to try on this list. Decision overload!

The food is tasty. I've had their salads, their burgers (including the vespa veggie burger), a fish sandwich, and their chili, as well as fries. I've found all of it to be pleasing. The prices are right on. 

Negatives.

The type of people they draw in aren't really my type of people. Lots of aggressive looking people in khakis, untucked button down shirts with the top button unbuttoned, and sandals, with well groomed hair cuts, resting asshole face with a gleam of smugness and mostly making aggressive, loud outbursts that makes their friends around them happy.... especially the empty looking women who probably at one point in their lives pretended they were one of the women from Sex in the City and deep down think that their self-worth depends on how well they can S.A.D. Basically, the types of cool guy frat boys who look really successful but also narcissistic, and the shallow, sheepish women type that everyone else in the world love (just not as much as they love themselves). I don't though. Maybe I'm the asshole. A judgmental asshole. But most of us are so F.U. 

This of course is not everyone there, but lots. Every time I've come here, it's been lots. Regardless, not my atmosphere. 

I've been bumped into a lot here as the inside is super crowded. Really REALLY crowded. The tables and chairs are packed in way too tightly. Even over the loud murmur of crowd noise you can somehow hear your neighbors conversations better than the person or people at your own table. I am not exaggerating this. The parking lot is worse. They should move to a larger location. 

I swear that the last time I came here, that my waitress was high as hell for the second half of our little unfortunate adventure with her. For one she sucked. She was slow, and very aloof. We didn't see her very long periods at a time. I even heard people at a nearby table (like 1 foot away) mention that she sucks too and so it wasn't just me. After her disappearance, I was relieved to see her because, well, we were wondering if she was okay at this point. She was. She was more than okay, as she was clearly blazed, which explains her prolonged absence. We got our check and she brought back our receipts, but no my debit card. Her potheadedness must have rubbed off on me because I didn't realize that she didn't bring my card back until later that night. 

Nothing wrong with that. I used to smoke the devil's lettuce too, back in the day, but I also believe that weed amplifies the negative aspects of one's personality and if she already was a crappy waitress then being high just made her ten times worse and she shouldn't be trusted with people's debit cards. :)

Overall, the atmosphere just isn't for me. I tried coming here a few times thinking it would be a nice go-to place for a beer and whatever, but I will pass this place up more often than decide to eat here. I give it an A-Ok, but am not a fan (3 of 5 stars).",Restaurant

Now I will say that I had gone in to the store ate around 6:00 already having had a bad, but these people only made it worse. I had earlier that morning dropped my phone in the sink while doing dishes, of course right before i had to go to work. So I just went all day with out my phone knowing I worked less then a mile away from a best buy, the best buy I had actually bought the phone from less then a week before. So i finished my work day and drove over. I walked in and was quickly directed to the Geek Squad center, per my insurance, and waited my turn. When they got to me, which took only about 20min. I quickly explained the situation and that the insurance I had purchased alittle over a week about was suppose to allow me to turn in the damaged phone and walk out with a new one or at least a loner till they could get the phone I needed if the did have it on hand.
They gave me a look which basically said you're not getting a new phone your whiney brat. They guy then told me that they didn't do that, they've never done that, and they will not every be doing that. I quickly turned into that customer we all hate to witness. I demanded that they play by the rules set out by the insurance I was playing for and stated that they had in fact replaced both mine and my younger sisters phones because of similar problems previously and there had been no problem. So the little simpering jerk went and grabbed his manager without giving me a response. 
The manager came out and basically said the same thing only saying it in the rudest tone I have ever heard a retail associate use. He also spent the whole time talking to me like I was a balling 5 year old who needed reprimanding, not an adult. Finally when i came to terms that they were not going to fix my phone i asked what they were going to do to get me a new. They said they weren't going to do anything that it was my job to mail in my phone to the verizon company and hopefully they would have a replacement to me in a week or so. They were dead serious when they said they wanted me to go a week with out a phone. I live alone, with no land line and need my phone for my job that could not happen. When I told them they had to do more for me, they flat out refused and wouldn't even get the address I was suppose to send the broken phone to. The only thing they did was tell me to go to the Geek Squad sight to find the address. At that point I was beyond frustrated and unfortunately cry, so much so that the lady behind me in line tried to jump in and help me. She also had a similar problem and received the same answer. So I left more angry the i thought possible to go home and try and figure out where to send my now useless phone and of course the website says I don't exist. 
I refused to go back a second time to that waste of space store, so i drove 45min out of my way after work to the BB in Happy Valley. I walked in and explained my situation and guess what? They took my phone and replaced it on the spot. They guys at the phone counter were beyond helpful and had me out the door in under 30min new phone and all. They told me they got a lot of pass offs from the Hayden store. That the people there just REFUSE to deal with problems like this because it reflects badly on their numbers so they either send them to another store or just tell customers there is nothing they will do. The guys at this best buy are the absolute worse and i would drive all the way to Cali, to avoid having to go to them again.  They lie to get out of working.",Shopping

The hostess couldn't find a clean table at which to seat us. That should have been the first clue that we were in trouble.

I passed by the salad bar on my way to our table. They were out of just about everything.  Guess I won't order salad bar. Second clue.

The man at the table next to us was complaining to a manager about waiting. Third clue.

Add to this the fact that the kids at the booth behind us were screaming and telling their parents to shut up. Par for the course at an establishment of this caliber. 

It took 15 minutes for our waitress to even appear. 

We finally got our drinks after 29 minutes at the table. She brought a few of the accessories- cole slaw, some dinner rolls. She walked away with my iced tea though. And we still had no silverware.  That took another 10 minutes. 

40 minutes into my Eat n Park experience and the two tables on my right are still dirty, as is the floor. (See picture)

My son said his chocolate milkshake was pretty good despite the fact that they screwed up and brought it with whipped cream and a cherry after I specifically requested that they leave those off.  

43 minutes and counting. No food yet. Our server,  Lori, just explained something about putting a big tickets for another group through before ours. Whatever. Thanks for trying to make your problems mine.   

They just bussed and cleaned the 2 dirty tables next to me. Not the floor though. Used napkins and straw wrappers and fries and all.

48 minutes. No food. And we're all out of drinks. 

Food arrived after 50 minutes at the table. It was just ok. My Nantucket cod looked like it had been baking under the warmer for a while. (See picture) It was pretty tasty, I will admit. They forgot my mother's garlic bread. 

59 minutes in, the waitress reappeared with one drink refill but none for the rest of our table. We asked about the garlic bread. Hmm. She was surprised we didnt have it and blamed it on the kitchen (but they aren't the ones who bring out our meals....) 

1 HR and 13 minutes. The waitress brought our check and the missing garlic bread.  
I just realized that she never brought my son his french fries at all.

She was nice enough to bring my 2 kids free Smiley cookies even though they are too old for the kids menu. 

At the register,  I asked to speak to the manager.  He apologized up and down. I told him that this was the worst Eat n Park experience I've ever had. I'm not one to complain but I work in a service industry and this was just horrible on every account. He discounted our bill by half. Not completely acceptable but whatever. He tried to tell me that they never get this busy. I kindly explained that, since there was no line waiting to be seated like there is on weekends and this was not during the actual dinner rush (it's 8:10pm) I doubt that what he's saying is true and he needs to get a grip and have a serious conversation with his staff, especially Lori the air headed server.

hPwbZnw1tTP4zSiwPEz3pA,u9r7r92gaqijc3eday-XkQ,4wpeWu0lCR_eEdGiyZB9rg,2016-09-10,"I discovered Rometrics salon through Groupon about 3 weeks before my vacation. I normally go to a long hair specialty salon, however with a vacation coming up I wanted to try to save a little bit of money. So when I saw a Groupon for the salon, and saw it had pretty decent reviews I decided to give it a try.

The first issue came when I tried to book my appointment via the Yelp app. At the top of their page there was a link that offered you to book your appointment online. I did so and booked for a cut. Later upon realizing that my Groupon was for a cut and deep conditioning treatment I contacted the salon via email asking if I needed to add additional time to the appointment for the deep conditioning treatment. When the salon called me back they told me they had no record of my appointment. They asked how I booked and I informed them through the Yelp app. They told me they did not offer any type of online booking, and did not have an appointment for me, but offered to book the appointment at that time. They didn't apologize for the confusion, and acted like I was just making it up, but you can clearly see where it says 'Book An Appointment' on the page. I also read them the confirmation email I received, and they said they ""don't do that"" and didn't know where that came from. I'm just glad I contacted them or else I would have walked in with no appointment. 

My appointment was on a Thursday afternoon with a stylist named Meg C. Meg did a thorough consultation and was polite and friendly. She cut my hair and gave me a curled round brushed blowout (which is how I mentioned to her that I like to wear my hair.) I suppose the error was both of our fault since I should have asked her to style it straight, that way she could have checked the cut afterwards. However, because she round brushed it out and it was curled she was unable (as was I) to see where the cut was very blunt in the back and the layers a little shorter on one side. 

I called the salon later that evening after I ironed out my hair and saw the error, and some rude girl begrudgingly offered to book me an appointment on Saturday morning with Meg again. On Friday after looking at my cut more closely I realized that I was really unhappy with it. I called the salon and asked to speak to a manager, and asked her if there was someone else who could fix my hair who is more experienced with long hair. (The reason I asked this was because I considered maybe long hair just wasn't her thing. As a former hairdresser myself I know we all have have our favorite things to do.) The manager I spoke to was very rude and basically told me she didn't believe me that my cut was uneven. She told me she was ""shocked"" and that Meg was their ""best stylist,"" and that Meg is the one who does her hair. She told me there was really no one else she could recommend since Meg was their best stylist. She also said that since I came in with a Groupon that my hair could only be fixed by another girl who takes Groupons. 

I thought that was a little bit ridiculous and realized at that point that the salon really doesn't care about client retention. Typically when you go back for a redo they will bump you up to a higher level stylist to ensure your cut is satisfactory, and to try to keep you as a client. The manager pretty much left me no real option, and so I told her it was fine I would go back and see Meg, and that if they really thought she was the best stylist then I felt confident trusting her to fix the cut- especially because I know even the best stylists have an off haircut every once in a while. However, I was still pretty annoyed that the manager didn't believe me (even after I offered to come back to the salon right then to show her my hair just to prove to her what I was saying), nor did she apologize, and was just completely unhelpful.

I went back in on Saturday morning and Meg fixed my hair, no problem. It took less than 15 mins, she was polite and friendly, and I tipped her again. After she said goodbye the girl sitting behind the desk (Kayla?) w\/ reddish purple hair smugly asks, ""Are you happy with your hair now?"" I told her yes, it was an easy fix, and walked out. 

I will definitely not return to the salon again. Meg wasn't a horrible stylist, and I would probably trust her to cut my hair again. She was never rude to me, and I saw several other nice stylists working. But the rest of the staff had horrible stink faces on, every person I spoke to on the phone was rude, and the treatment from the ""manager"" was unacceptable. In the future I would much rather cough up the $75 for my other stylist, because saving the money was not worth all of this. It's unfortunate when an otherwise decent stylist loses a potential long term client because of the lack of professionalism from other team members. I honestly would not recommend this salon.",Beauty
b6V2iRpiia0AzgOtiBMcSQ,7uEuP9iJEzCshvDKS7_n8w,10Jk5ilimXrfAq8JJ1gISg,2012-10-02,"Stick to the grilled foods and keep it simple when you die at Saigon Grille.  

Saigon Grille was an average experience for me.  The service was ok, not bad but not great.  The food was ok, but not great.  Actually, ""ok, but not great"" was really the theme of the expeirence.

We had the Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe), Canh Ga Chien B (Butter Fried Chicken Wings 4pc.), Crispy Pork Skin Rolls (it was a rice paper roll), Pho Tai Sach (Pho with eye round steak and tripe), and Bun Thit Nuong cha gio (Vermicelli rice noodles with marinated grilled pork and chopped egg rolls).

The thit nuong cha gio was good.  The grill flavor made the dish pop.  It's fairly simple dish and we did spice it up a lot with the red pepper paste, but I was quite happy with this one and I would eat it again.  The flavors were clean and simple and I wanted to keep stealing bites from my wife.  Even so, compared to the food I've had at other Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland, this was average at best.  

The pho was actually pretty good, but they didn't hit it out of the park.  The broth was full of flavor and quite lively.  The beef didn't do me wrong and the tripe was actually quite tender given it's tripe.  There was plenty of meat in the bowl, but I would have liked a bit more tripe.  I would say their pho is better than most places in Cleveland, but I wouldn't deem it to be a great success. #1 Pho is still my favorite, but I would eat Saigon Grille's pho again.

The other items (the appetizers) were nothing special, and in some cases complete failures.  The wings were super crispy, which I really liked, but I would have loved to get something more than sweet chili sauce to dip them in.  These were plain wings, after all.  I would probably skip these next time.

The crispy pork skin rolls lost their crisp--it tasted like they made the wraps earlier in the day.  The refrigeration and moisture from the noodles got rid of the most important texture of the food--the crisp.  The crispy pork skin rolls were also quite flavorless.  I could have done without the rolls.   

The banh xeo  was an oily mess.  It  was not a traditional banh xeo\/Vietnamese crepe. I would say this was more like a thick Chinese pancake wrapped around canned shrimp and some cooked beef, then doused in oil.  The oil was so heavy that all I could really taste was the oil--the flavors of the ingredients or any seasoning they might have used were completely lost.  I think I could taste the green onion, but that was it.  Since the item was super thick and messy, it just didn't work.  I wish I hadn't ordered it.

Our server was attentive to start, but she was confused on our orders even when we ordered by the menu numbers.  My wife asked to have her dish made spicy and the sever just told us to add some of the sriracha and red pepper paste on the table to our food.  I'm sure they have something in the kitchen to make the food spicy for us, but that's not a huge deal and we made it work.  I was kind of irked when I had to go to the server to give her our payment--she didn't come back after she paid the bill even though this wasn't one of those joints where you pay at the register near the exit.",Restaurant
VseulA5gPddU2Zbyc6rkOA,-RhRXVW9z9fs5zzxhFfnHg,-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,2010-03-30,"Really disappointed with this place.  Actually, I shouldn't say that I am wholly disappointed with the place as much as I am disappointed with the quality of service that I get for the outrageous price.

The wife and I weren't terribly hungry (after a killer breakfast from another of FRC's spots - True Food) but it was lunch time and we weren't going to have a chance to eat again till much later so we wandered over to Zin burger.  Cool place.  Nice inside.  Looks like most of the newer FRC places.  Good vibe, crazy walls, wicked wait for a burger place.

So we each got a milkshake and then split an order of sweet potato fries and a bacon burger.  The milkshake was a double chocolate mint shake that was excellent.  I didn't think the $6 price tag was outrageous but when it came out and only 1\/4 inch of my spoon was sticking out of the glass, I was a bit annoyed.  You know you have shakes, you are the ones who bought the glasses, maybe buy some shake spoons?  For $6 I shouldn't have to fish it out.  Anyways, it was good.  Better than most restaurant shakes, so I was happy.

The fries came out next.  Thought it was a bit odd since we didn't order them separately but I guess the waiter thought they were our appetizer.  The yogurt dipping sauce is very tart by itself but it a perfect compliment to the fries.  The fries are also bathed in salt so I enjoyed them very much.  In all, the fries were good but the presentation was pretty cheap.  The ramekin of yogurt was sitting on the fries inside the paper-lined basket.  It had spilled on the fries.  I'd prefer a plate.

Finally (and I do mean FINALLY...like 35 minutes after ordering), the burger came out.  It had been cut in half, which I appreciated.  It was cooked to a perfect medium and was pretty tasty.  We gad ordered the Samburger because my wife likes bacon but I really wasn't feeling that bacon.  I wished it had the turkey bacon from True Food because the Applewood Smoked bacon that was on there was hard and tasteless.  In all, it was a good burger.  Was it a good $10 burger?  Not really, but half is enough to fill you up, and if you split it, it is only a $5 burger.  For $5, it is great!

Now to my final complaint and the thing that would normally make me turn this into a 2 star review but I know that they are going to fix it.  Despite their intention to fix it, it was still left this way and still screwed up my experience.  If you sit in one of the booths behind the hostess table, you have a perfect view of the men's bathroom door.  No big deal except, and this is a big except, when someone opens that door to go in...you get a full on view of someone using the urinal.  Now that kind of thing might fly over around 7th Ave & Indian School but not at Biltmore and not for these prices.  I do not want to watch people urinate and do all of the other things that guys do while they are in the bathroom while I am eating.  I'm sorry but it was gross.

Lastly, don't have Harold as your waiter.  He was snotty, insistent, and inattentive.  He took plates before we were done, had an attitude when we asked to split the burger, and continually ignored us as he attended to the larger (and subsequently more lucrative) table next to us.

I might give Zinburger another chance but in reality, there are enough burger places along Camelback (Modern Burger, Grind, Culvers, Smashburger, Wineburger, etc) to keep me occupied for a while.",Restaurant
lWe_RqxEtUOq91WeazBHrQ,KC6RQlajTSBY-VrZeme2hA,e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg,2015-05-04,"I had read the numerous reviews of this place and it all seemed mixed.  Some gave it raving reviews and others not so much.  I wanted to see for myself what exactly this resto had to offer so my husband and I came here for lunch yesterday.  

We ordered: 
1) Grandpa's Fun Guo - Flavourful is the word I would use to describe it.  Expensive for 3 pieces of dim sum (esp when down the street you can get it for 2 dollars).  But I do have to give it credit, this is probably the best thing we ate while here.  My husband felt that the cashews\/ nuts needed to be a bit chunkier to give it more of a texture.  Otherwise it was fine. 

2) Poutine - Not good.  It's essentially cubed potatoes and sweet potatoes topped with some cheese, silken tofu and some sauce.  The potatoes were inconsistently cooked - some were clearly underdone.  The flavour profile is interesting....it's not spicy, not savoury, not sweet.  It's not really appetizing. 

3) General Sander's chicken platter - This was a relatively large dish for 25 dollars.  I think we got 6 pieces of dark meat chicken in total and an HK style egg waffle.  Let's start with the chicken.  The chicken was good.  Good crispy exterior albeit slightly dark in colour and perhaps slightly overdone.  Thankfully they give you dark meat otherwise I think it would be terribly dry.  Next, the dipping sauce.  One of them is a sichuan maple syrup.  It is absolutely atrocious.  It's not spicy...it's not sweet...it didn't enhance the flavour of the chicken.  The only word I could use to describe this is terribly unpalatable.  After dipping my first piece of chicken into it, I could not bear to touch it again...it was that awful.  Next are the HK style egg waffles which are actually a shade of dark brown.  They looked overdone.  But when you actually eat it, it's actually UNDERDONE inside! What?? How is that possible...it looks near burnt but inside is actually a thick underdone batter.  If anyone has ever had HK style waffles they're actually quite light and loose inside.  

We actually told the hostess or waitress about the underdone yet seemingly overdone waffles.  Her response was ""Ok.""  Nothing was done to address it and we're not asking for a discount or a free meal or anything but we really just want them to be aware that this is not how HK style waffles are supposed to be. We're not even sure if the message got passed along to the kitchen.   

We also asked for sparking water which I'm fairly certain they keep on tap and make themselves.  For this water, we were charged 5 dollars.  Ok, I get it if you have to open up a bottle of San Pellegrino or Perrier or something but you didn't.  You just added carbon dioxide to your own tap water! Some restaurants give this for free (i.e. Pizzeria Libretto).  So why are you charging me 5 dollars for not even opening up a bottle of anything?  

When this first restaurant opened, I wanted to like it.  I occasionally watched the first season of Masterchef Canada and watched Eric cook and to be honest, I was kind of rooting for him since not many Asians win and he also went to my alma mater. Not only that but when I was in Hong Kong earlier this year, I wanted to try Bo Innovation but couldn't because I couldn't eat a lot of the food they were serving as I was pregnant but had heard good things from family and friends who ate it.   Unfortunately this restaurant was not good and overpriced.  The one word I would use to describe the food is unpalatable.  I think that speaks volumes unfortunately.  We did see Eric come in during our meal and he was carrying a huge bag of rice and some other things.  Seems like he's putting a lot of hard work into the restaurant but as much as I would like to like it, objectively it just wasn't good.  So I really hope things change.",Restaurant

It was my first time here & it was pretty standard walking in. I let them know I had an appointment and the guy, Nick?, told me to pick my color. I picked my color and sat down. Then he told me again to pick my color which I already had so I showed him then he pointed to An and said to see her. First impression-- service\/awareness was lacking but I was really happy that my appointment was right on time and she was able to see me shortly after getting there. 

This nail salon is clean and chic! Even if you're not a fan of the color pink, it's all tastefully done and in a fun way. You walk in and you know you're in Vegas!

I planned to do the Plop Plop pedi then saw it was a special so that sealed the deal. Normally $60. Today it was $55. Pricier pedi upgrade than what I'm used to but by the description it seemed like something I could really use as I'm always on my feet and was really looking forward to baby soft skin after this. Fast forward--- my feet aren't as smooth as they normally come out with the other places I go to for just basic pedis. But other than that, the pedi was good.

An was friendly and attentive. She asked if I wanted anything to drink once I sat down. Noticing I was new, she helped me adjust my chair and pointed out the features-- I really appreciated that. I loved how the products were organized and pre-measured. The woman who was helping with cleaning the tubs came by regularly changing towels and refilling bottles- that was nice to see. The person working next to An (lots of tattoos, wild nails, glasses) was hilarious, informative & super personable. She's someone I'd be happy to see too. Back to An- I made the appointment with her because of all the great Yelp reviews saying that the nails will last longer when she does them. Can't rate her on that yet, but I can say she seemed very interested in making sure I was happy with her service. Oh and her hands! My goodness- they are strong! I loved that. The leg\/foot massage had the right amount of pressure which isn't always the case.

Sounds great, right?! Well, it could've been but sadly wasn't. If it was just the initial impression, I could have looked past that. But there were a couple more things.

1) when I sat down to see An, she asked if I was just doing a pedicure or if I wanted her to do a mani too. I let her know I'd be interested in a basic mani but only if she had time. She said she'd ask her boss about her schedule when she went to get my water. She never said anything when she came back. When the pedicure was done she said to make sure that I wait 10 minutes before leaving to give my nails a chance to dry. This indicated to me that she didn't have time for the manicure. No problem. I waited with my toes under the light & she came back 17 minutes later saying that someone would be by in a while to do my manicure. ??? Plus there was already another gal waiting for a mani and no one currently available to either of us. I was pretty turned off by that because had I left 7 minutes earlier when she suggested, was someone still planning on doing the mani? I don't know, there was no prior communication. And I had requested her if she had time, if not I would just come back another time. So I wasn't interested in being shoved off to someone else.

2) after reading a few reviews saying how friendly the manager Nick is and how he checks on the customers and introduces himself, I was super excited that the service would be great here! Well, I saw him do this with multiple customers today (including ones who were sat right next to me), engaging with them, asking how things are, making jokes etc. Not once did he acknowledge me though...aside from the ""pick your color"" thing. That would have normally been ok with me because I'm usually an in and out kind of person, but being excited about trying a new place, I was open to and interested in adding on other services if they had time. Specifically I wanted to ask about the lashes! But not once did he acknowledge me. This was a big let down. I was ready to get Nailed and Lashed, even if it meant coming back another day. But with the inconsistent customer service and the lack of communication, it left a bad taste in my mouth.

I ended up taking care of my bill and leaving without getting the mani done.

For me, this place was so close to being THE ""go-to"" spot. It just fell short in a couple key areas for me.",Beauty
eGpIf_RI1dirKjYVSdV4tg,l_mcfSIukGxWE-KRJWNxsQ,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2014-12-09,"Where to begin... This review is based on my most recent visit to Vdara (during the Thanksgiving week).
I had stayed in Vdara in the past and had nothing but good things to say about the resort - good rates, cleanness, great service, amazing view, perfect deco, location etc.

Ever since we stayed in Vdara (we've stayed practically everywhere else on the strip and Aria was our favorite so far), we don't even bother looking into other hotels since.  Sometimes a bad hotel experience could ruin the entire trip, so this had saved us a lot of time and effort searching for a place to stay whenever we visit LV (I usually go to LV at least 2~3 times a year).

However, our most recent visit ended in disaster after we had encountered... BED BUGS (or it could be some other type of bugs).  It is hard to believe that there could be bed bugs in a resort such as this, even I had doubts... but it happened.

We had stayed 3N\/4D and on the second night, I folded out the sofa bed and slept on it.  In the morning next day, I had noticed certain rashes on both of my legs and on my friend's stomach (her daughter also had rash on her thighs - they both used the sofa bed to watch TV the night before).  We first thought it might be something in the linens and asked the housekeeping to look into it before going out to lunch.  Although we had requested for housekeeping on three different ways - 1) left the housekeeping light ""on"", 2) notified the housekeeping who came by earlier that we need it during lunch, and 3) requested to the front desk while waiting for valet.

However, when we had returned to our room, the housekeeping still had not come by yet.  Once we called, they came after almost an hour wait and we had to wait for another half hour or so waiting for them to finish.  Later that night, my rash had gotten worse and it even started to bleed in certain places.  Then it started to sting and the pain was unbearable... it literally felt like I was being stung by dozens of bees at once.  My gf suggested that I filled the tub with warm water and put my legs in for a while, which eased the pain a bit.  Other still had minor rashes, but mine was the worst (I was the only one who slept on it all night).  Once the pain had gotten little better, I spent the last night of my trip sleeping on the floor (everybody was too tired and we didn't want to bother switching rooms or deal with it since we were leaving the next morning).

Next day when I was checking out, I made a quick visit to the front desk to notify what had happened and showed them the pictures of my leg which I had taken over the night before.  The front desk called the manager because this was a ""security protocol"" who had asked me to make a statement with their security dept.  We were on our way out and the valet had already pulled out our car so we were in a hurry but they said it will only take a minute so I decided to wait.  While waiting for the security officer the manager took off the resort fees as courtesy... SERIOUSLY?!  I was in pain all night and practically ruined my last night of our trip and he took $28\/day off for our stay?!  The funny thing is that when I headed to the front desk, I was not expecting any kind of comp because of this, I solely did it because we thought it's something they should be aware of.  But when they took off the resort fee and made it seem like it was a huge comp they were giving us, then the whole thing just felt like an insult.  On top of that, we had waited for over 15 minutes and the security officer still had not shown up.  I told the front desk that we need to leave, and she had offered that she'll have someone call me for the statement shortly.  The funny thing is that it's been weeks and I still haven't received a call for a statement.  And it was the hotel who NEEDED the statement, not me.

We really did enjoy staying in Vdara in the past and there's a good chance that we'll most likely stay there on our next trip, but the most recent stay\/incident made it seem very difficult to make such decision easily nor recommend to others (which I have done so since we first stayed).  

Again, it really is a great hotel with exception qualities but I do not recommend using their sofa bed or if you do, just keep an eye out if you noticed unusual rash or marks on your skin soon after.",Beauty

There are multiple veggie options on the menu (full color and pictorial) and although most of them are listed as appetizers, you can easily make a meal out of two items and leave satiated. The dishes we ordered were simple but deliciously filled with an abundance of incredible flavor. 

Everything tasted as if it had been made-to-order. I think there was a solo operation going on in the kitchen because our plates came out one at a time. But it's all for one and one for all at our table so even though sharing the first dish was obligatory, as other plates arrived and covered the table in goodness we were all happily chomping on our own dishes and finished eating around the same time. 

Here's what the vegetarians ordered:

Hummus - $5.50
Yummy, creamy. Just fancied up with a topping of whole chickpeas, olive oil, and flavor. 

Baba Ghanouj - $6.50
The menu says ""smoked to perfection"" and I wholeheartedly agree. The eggplant was perfectly smooth, tasty, topped with tomato garnish, olive oil, and flavor.

M'jadara - $5.00
Lentils with rice, topped with crispy onions and flavor.
Normally I would not have liked this dish because the rice was mushy combined with the texture of the lentils, but it was delicious. I actually dug in and ate a few spoonfuls. 
If you like beans and rice, order it.

Roasted brussels sprouts - $5.00
Tossed with cranberries. Not crunchy, yet firm. Yeh to firm green veggies. I was impressed with the melange. 

Muhammara - $5.50
My first time hearing of this dish. It's a red pepper paste mixed with walnuts. The menu claimed ""spicy red pepper"" and although one person at the table tasted some heat, all I got was a mouthful of saltiness. Too salty for my taste, but I liked it paired with the m'jadara and brussels sprouts. 

Fattoush rotana salad - $7.00
Wow. This salad was the most complicated looking dish on the table. Like a kaleidoscope - purple, orange, red, all shades of greens, there may have been yellow too. Piled with several ingredients and topped with fried pita, flavorful dressing, and some delicious seasoning that I've never tasted before. 
I. Wanted. To. Lick. The. Salad. 
Are you hearing me?
Lick. It.

Falafel - $6.00
Thankfully the fritters were not oily, but unfortunately their texture was dry and uneventful. If there exists a falafel spectrum in the universe, it must only read ""dry"" on one end and ""oily"" on the opposite end with nothing in-between because I've only had falafel either dry or oily. Haven't found a restaurant yet that has found a balance. Skip it.

Vegetarian burger - $6.00
An overgrown falafel in burger clothes. Normally that would be okay, but this falafel was dry, so unless you like it like that, skip it.",Restaurant
oGpR3-ubAVuXP7YGhYnMmw,gPVEMx8aK7ghaTU-BNaQkQ,ruSF2hHpQX5Ea9qW0Gyv2A,2016-09-03,"I thought we were in good hands with Lodi because we were buying our new garage door and motor through Costco. Costco stands behind their products and services but this experience was terrible. 

In mid-May 2016, our sales rep, Mark, promised a 15% Costco cash rebate, saying that even though the promotion ended two days prior that he would honor it. We chose our door, windows and motor and had to wait more than a month for our new door to arrive because it was wider than the standard size. I should have known something was wrong when I looked at the contract after he left and didn't see any mention of the 15% rebate, and when I called to confirm I was still getting the extra 5% within five minutes of him leaving, he didn't answer and never returned my call. We paid everything up front, and he was outta there.

Fast forward to installation day - June 17th. Not only were the windows the WRONG size (we ordered 4 long-panel windows, and got 8 small windows) there was a gap in between the door and the ground, but only on one side. This was not the case with our prior door so I knew it was a mistake with the install. The installer looked at the paperwork and said Mark had made no mention of long panel windows on the order. He said he will contact Mark and that he would call me the same day. Naturally, no phone call came.

Within a couple weeks, the Costco card came. And guess how much was on it? DING DING DING!! That's right, just the standard 10%. I called Costco since Mark was completely unresponsive to my messages and I hate to say it, but they were no help. They said that the extra rebate had to be noted by the contractor and that I needed to connect with them. It had now been a month and not a single person had so much as lifted a finger to fix the three major problems with our garage door installation experience. When I called the main Lodi phone number and explained what happened - very nicely, despite how pissed off I was at this point - and that Mark was not returning my calls and that I would like to talk to a supervisor, the lady who answered was very rude and refused to let me speak to anyone other than Mark. She said only he can handle it and that I could call back after 1:00 and she will make sure he talks to me. Gee thanks, that is super reassuring, considering it's been more than a month since our install and NOTHING has been done to resolve this after several attempts to just get someone on the phone. It should take no more than ONE phone call if a problem arises to hear back, and here I am literally chasing him down from every angle and still, nothing.

Needless to say, when I called back, I got his voice mail. I left a message saying I would appreciate a call back and that he needs to do the right thing and have some integrity and fix the problem. Well, I guess it worked, because hallelujah! I finally got a call! Mark apologized, said he would have ""them"" put the extra 5% on the card I already have, he would order the correct window panel, and when they install it they would fix the gap in the door. He asked that I send a photo of the gap via text. So I did. 

And... radio silence. 

That was on July 19th. And I have heard NOTHING since. No new windows. No rebate added to my card. No phone call to schedule the install. And I think it is safe to assume my window panels, which take extra time to make because of their size, haven't so much as been requested. 

Under no circumstances would I EVER recommend this company to anyone, ever. What kind of customer service experience is this? They screw up three MAJOR things and can't even be bothered to return phone calls, let alone fix the problem? Costco will be getting this same review in the hopes that they find another contractor to work with because this is ridiculous. It shouldn't take three solid months after an installation to have a problem so much as addressed. That brings us up to four months since we paid them $2700 UP FRONT and did not get what we paid for. 

Get it together, Lodi. You have more than just my one-star review. It's time you man up and own your horrible customer experiences. You may not go out of business but you will go on knowing you operate with absolutely ZERO integrity. Not the reputation I would want in business!",Shopping

Needless to say, we all know that this place had its grand opening only a couple days ago and are offering half off AYCE sushi. I thought I'd wait until the hype had died down, but was given a chance to come tonight. A couple friends and I came here tonight (Tuesday night) a little before 7pm, apparently right after a party of 25 came in.

Entrance : you enter through unmarked regular doors and come upon a wall straight in front of you. There, you wait for someone to seat you when they see you(Fortunately for us, my friend was seated and we didn't have to wait there, but we saw many people standing awkwardly for a while until someone approached them). 

Decor: white walls over, chic wood looking benches\/seats, sushi bar to the left, and a colored and lit DJ\/Bar looking area to the back. Very clean 

Service: Servers are super nice. Devi was amazing, and always checked up on us, as well as tried to get our orders going along. However the service time was Ridiculously long. We waited an hour after we ordered, to get our food from the bar. (we were able to snack on ""appetizers"" that were able to be made in the back, such as edamame). They spent all of their time waiting on the group of 25, that we could see that our table as well as 5 others around us weren't being served anything. The 3 sushi chefs (found out that one had called out) were filling orders only for that table, and no other tables were served. When they were finally serving good to other tables, lots of rolls were being run to the wrong tables. However, you could tell everyone on staff plus the man who we believe may have been the owner or MOD at the time was frantically trying to figure it out. Effort was great, execution was not. Definitely needed to fix their system. 

Food: after waiting an hour (1 hr and 4 min actually) for our first roll from the actual bar, it was just subpar. You could tell at this point that they just needed to get orders out. It was made a bit sloppier, with a tad too much sauce on a couple of the rolls, but the quality of some of the fish was actually pretty good. (Fatty, large pieces of salmon nigiri was great). Unfortunately we didn't get to try all the rolls we ordered because they missed about 3 rolls. (1 order would be missing out of 4 that we would ask for per ticket). 
**if you do go in the future, order the dessert type roll. (gorilla roll?) It has mango, banana, and strawberry and was pretty good. Even decided to order vanilla ice cream with it. 

Honestly, I believe this has largely to do with them being open for such a short amount of time and most likely not being prepared for large crowds\/large parties. We left 2.5 hours later at 9:30, not full and not very satisfied. We even felt bad for the table that came in not too long after us that had barely gotten any food. If it wasn't for how wonderful and sympathetic our server was as well as the the decor, this place would have 1 star. 

My suggestion is to stay away from this place until at least a couple weeks after the grand opening and come during slower hours. :) the half off was not worth it.",Restaurant

The local soap, facial mist, body cream, beard oil and deodorant line uses natural, vegan ingredients to create heavenly smelling offerings, which are cruelty-free. It was founded in 2007 by charming local lady Tracy Perkins and is sold in Whole Foods stores around Arizona, as well as online and in shops around the Valley and in California.

After a recent visit with Tracy, I took home a bag full of goodies I'm sort of addicted to smelling. The packaging is also adorable, and the soaps are really pretty - like extra decorations for your bathroom.

I'm absolutely in love with the Tea Tree-Rosemary Face bar, $9, with organic coconut oils, organic palm oil and natural herbs, spices and minerals. It's ideal for oily to combination skin, promoting antioxidant activity and includes invigorating peppermint and gentle exfoliating qualities. It smells amazing - probably the best thing to cover your face with on the daily - and really leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.

I got two soaps - some Blueberry Lavender, $8, which is one of Tracy's most popular brands, and a Lavender Vanilla, $8, which has two of my favorite scents.

They're both made with organic coconut oils, palm oils, herbs and minerals, and they work up great lathers that will make you never want to stop washing your hands.

I also was treated to a Hydrating Mist, $10, a refreshing spray that is good for setting mineral makeup or to just cool off and add some antioxidant-filled ingredients to your precious pores. It contains tea, organic aloe vera and essential oils, and instead of leaving you oily, it helps to balance your hydration levels so you don't overproduce oil to compensate for dryness. As someone with oily skin, trust me, I love this mist!

One of the coolest things about Strawberry Hedgehog is that there are ""Soap Clubs"" offered. Because the soaps are all made from vegan ingredients, they have a shorter shelf life than artificial stuff, so it's best to get them in smaller quantities. With the Soap Club, you get a unique new scent each month, and each bar lasts one person who uses it for daily showering about a month. The club starts at $30 for three months, which includes all shipping and handling. You're saving money on three bars, and you get access to seasonal or special scents. What a cool gift idea! The more you purchase, the higher the discount.

Your skin is your largest organ, and accordingly, what you put on your body is just as important as what you put inside it. That was one of the biggest lessons I learned at Tracy Perkins' Beauty Detox 101 workshop at Strawberry Hedgehog natural body care shop in Phoenix this past weekend. The workshop provided lots of valuable advice when it came to being aware of the toxins your body ingests through products, with informative sessions covering ingredients to avoid and beauty myths to squash.

Perkins is highly knowledgeable about the value of vegan beauty products. Perkins used to work at a major beauty brand before getting sick from their products. Now she creates her own adorable goodies, using natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals or toxins. 

Besides getting to know ingredients to avoid on labels (fragrance is a HUGE one), workshop participants were also treated to delicious vegan eats and tea, and we even made our own facial and body scrubs using essential oils. The two-hour workshop was so much fun, and we left with a ton of recipes to continue healthy beauty rituals at home.

Perkins regularly hosts workshops on a variety of topics. Her next one, Saturday, April 18, is Essential Oil First Aid and costs $40.",Beauty
vUkyqmqs7SYkz6leb4TJSw,dp3BUXx5Wy1MhslPs6-7Gg,8ZCC-A--VyTtdVJZepmZog,2016-12-11,"I bought a package of 9 sessions and received 3 for free because I bought it during their Black Friday sale

Owner has been rude to me every time I came in. Always rushing and changing dates around. 

There is constantly issues with the plumbing or water heater is constantly out or messing up so I've already had to reschedule 4 times. The times that I had to reschedule, I was never called or notified in advanced so I had already drove to the facility and as I was signing in, I was THEN told that I was going to have to reschedule. One of those times the entire facility was closed for the day and my appt was the first in the morning so I was stuck waiting outside in the cold (i have cold urticaria - I'm allergic to cold temperatures... Literally) while I tried calling and knocking because I was confused as to why the door wasn't open. I finally got someone's attention and was told that the water heater was out so they closed for the day to get it fixed and I had to call later on to reschedule. 

There are 2 colon hydrotherapy systems that they offer: the closed system which has a therapist in the room with you and the open system which is called ""The Libby"" where you are doing the session by yourself. The closed system is great because it's a deeper clean, however, the castor oil that is used for a lube to put the tube into your rectum is somewhat sticky and the tube isn't worked into your anus, it's shoved in. I started requesting if I could self insert because the way that they do it is painful. 

One of the reasons why I decided to choose this place was because they offered a Wheat grass shot and a probiotic after your session. However, the wheatgrass shot is prejudiced in the morning (which is great) BUT it's also premixed in with orange juice. You aren't even getting a full shot of wheatgrass because it's mainly orange juice. After your session they get the wheatgrass\/orange juice mixture out of the fridge and because its in a clear bottle that has been sitting, you can see the separation of wheatgrass and orange juice... Its mainly orange juice... I'm not one to be a stickler for things like this but if a SHOT of wheatgrass is a selling point for the package, then I would like a SHOT of wheatgrass, NOT a shot of orange juice with a wheat grass taste. They also didn't even tell me that it was a wheatgrass\/orange juice mixture. I was told that their wheatgrass is ""naturally sweet"", but when I drank it, I could taste the orange juice and had to ask if it was already mixed with orange juice. I was then told ""it has juice a splash or orange juice"". I'm not dumb. --I have talked to them about this and they seemed to be concerned about it but it's never changed. 

They kindly offer Netflix to watch while you are in your sessions so you aren't sitting their bored or needing to waste your phone battery out while scrolling around online to pass the time, HOWEVER, the Internet is out a lot as well so forget about wifi or Netflix every so often. I guess it's not all that bad... I got to type out this review on my phone for the last 45 minutes.

1 Probiotic in pill form was included after every session with my package as well and I have to ask for them after ever session while getting an irritated look from the staff... it doesn't matter what staff member is there. They have all been incredibly rude and always seem irritated when a client asks questions. 

A colon hydrotherapist named Brittany Chivira was my original therapist and was supposed to be my therapist throughout the sessions but she lasted for 2 sessions before she was fired for stealing money from the company. I only know this information because I constantly heard the entire staff gossiping about it and then I was told by one of the staff members directly about it as I was checking out. 

I was told that I needed to buy supplements that they offer and I was sold some supplements that I didn't need. I did however, end up bringing the unopened bottles back for a refund. They tried to say that I couldn't have my cash back even though I paid in cash and the bottles were unopened. They tried to give me ""store credit"" even though I knew I wasn't going to be coming back after my package was done. They ended up giving me cash back after complaining. 

By my 5th session they stopped offering the wheat grass shot even though it was apart of my package. They are now offering a shot glass of electrolytes in a cup that taste horrible... Not impressed

Now I'm finding out that the place has closed? I also read a review that they changed their name to Love My Colon. Hopefully I'll at least get to finish out my sessions and get part of my money's worth. It's been a huge a waste of money so far... here's hoping. I would HIGHLY recommend going somewhere else.",Beauty

I was in the middle of house sitting and babysitting my puppy and was located by the M resort, so I tried to coordinate brunch with my friends.  I've never been to a Hash House before and thought this would have been the best opportunity to ""hit two birds with one stone.""  It gave me the opportunity to reconnect with friends and try a new place for my Yelp reviews.  

The first thing that gave me a sign that this place was going to be good was the long wait.  First off, there was a 10 minute wait to get a buzzer.  Then it was an hour wait after wards.  WOW.  We were about to leave to go somewhere else.  I'm glad we stayed.  The outside of the restaurant had a giant size menu so we could figure out what we were going to get.  There was a bar area to the right and a waiting area to the right where the hostess stand was.  In the middle were three big barrel tower stands and a car looking statue.  The tables were metal tops with small vases of grains in it.  The tag line I saw was ""twisted far rm food,"" which makes sense that the decor farmers chic mixed with a modern twist.  What I really liked was the floor to ceiling windows which offered very dramatic views of the entire valley.  I really enjoyed that part of breakfast.  

For my meal, I got the Man vs. Food favorite, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict for $15.95.  This meal was HUGE!!!  They even stuck a steak knife in the middle to prevent the entire dish from falling over.  Where do I begin...hmmm...well, let's start from the bottom!  The dish was on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes.  On top of that was a light and airy, flaky biscuit.  On top of the biscuit was fresh spinach leaves, sliced tomatoes, smokey bacon, a huge cut of sage breaded fried chicken breast and topped with grilled mozzarella cheese.  The entire dish is heavily drizzled with a spicy chipotle cream sauce with chopped peppers and tomatoes.  Garnished with a pineapple and orange slice.  The chicken was definitely the star of the show for me.  Super juicy and super flavorful.  The chipotle cream sauce really enhanced the flavor of the entire dish and I loved that the tomatoes and spinach really livened up the dish with freshness.  I LOVED THIS DISH!  It will definitely keep me coming back.  I also got to try a friend's meatloaf hash and another friend's brown sugar banana pancakes which were both delicious as well.  

When you come to this place, you better expect a long wait, especially on Sunday brunch.  Please stick around, you won't be disappointed!  This place really delivered it for my first visit.  First impressions mean everything and I can't wait to return with other people who haven't been there so I can introduce them to the wonders of Hash House!",Restaurant
Dltearvz1wNvV8NUClxnCg,Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ,2011-04-17,"I arrived expecting a great night here but due to the horrible Sangria and Paella, mediocre tapas, and lousy service, I left extremely disappointed. 

I have walked by this place a few times before and seeing all the people on the patio enjoying the beautiful sunset and listing to the Flamenco music, it just seemed like a cool place. Unfortunately, we did not have reservations and so although the patio was complete empty when we arrived, we were told by the host (owner?) in a very condecending way that all the tables on the patio were reserved and so we would have to be seated inside. That dampened my spirits a little but I was still anticipating an enjoyable evening with my hubby and some good food. To start off, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share and some soup. Sangria arrived first in a surprisingly small pitcher. I could not believe that small pitcher was $22!  It turned out to be a good thing since it was so bad, neither one of us wanted to drink it. It was by far the worst Sangria I have ever had. It tasted like it was 1\/2 cheap red wine and 1\/2 club soda. Not sweet, not fruity. Instead of bright refreshing slices of citrus and other fruits there were a few bits of orange rind and a couple of pieces of some other fruit that had been diced so small it was unrecognizable. I ordered the gazpacho which was pretty good although I prefer it chunky rather than pureed and my husband got the seafood stew. That had a good flavor to it but the seafood in it was very overcooked. 

We decided not to order any tapas with seafood in them after seeing the quality that was in the soup. We selected three Tapas to start with: the beef tenderloin, the leek tart, and the potato tortilla. The beef was pretty good, nothing special about it but it had a good flavor. The leek tart was not so great but the sauce it came with was delicious and we mopped it up with the bread in the bread basket. The tortilla was disappointing. To me this is the quintessential tapa dish so I was expecting it to be great but it was rubbery and tasteless as if it had been prepared hours earlier and then reheated. We had intended to start with only 3 tapas since we had already had the soup and told our waiter that we reserved the right to order more. He pressured us into ordering some paella as well so we did. Now I absolutely love paella, it is truly one of my favorite dishes on earth but since other Yelp reviewers had said to stay away from it I ordered it with some misgivings. 

The paella arrived about 20 minutes after we had finished the rest of our meal. Our waiter did warn us that it took a while to prepare but I was not expecting it to take that long. As soon as we tried it, I realized that it was not worth the wait. As other reviewers have mentioned it was way too watery and very bland tasting. In addition, the vegetables tasted like they came from a bag in the freezer section. And the seafood was the same rubbery stuff that was in the soup. The rings of calamari were so tough, you could not cut them with a fork, I had to use a serrated knife. The shrimp had lost all of its sweet flavor and was just as tough. The entire dish was so awful that we didn't even finish it. 

So, they were already down two stars for the horrible Sangria and Paella... Also while waiting for the Paella, I visited the ladies room which although beautifully decorated was filthy. Dirty restaurant bathrooms are a personal pet-peeve of mine so that had knocked them down a star as well. Also, the cheesy outfits the servers wear and the overall poor service (we were brought the wrong dishes initially and had to ask repeatedly for plates since we were sharing) had knocked them down another star. The final straw was that as we were leaving I counted four empty tables on the patio that we could have been seated at.  Overall, just a horrible experience.  I strongly recommend staying away from this place.",Restaurant
Ya4w_rlf0mEaodKeatRcYA,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ,2011-07-26,"I returned to the Dragon Pearl Buffet to celebrate Elaine K.'s birthday with a group of 30.  This place is definitely constructed for parties.  I think I saw at least 3 birthday parties simultaneously happening at the same time.  If you want to sit on the ""boat"" make sure your party has less than 22 people as that is the maximum capacity.  Unfortunately, Elaine K.'s popularity prevented us from fulfilling our pirate fantasies, lol.

The service levels have definitely gone downhill.  I returned many times to my table to find my dishes were still on the table.  One of our dining companions ended up doing a circus balancing act when his dishes started to pile up.  We were all placing bets on when his Jenga tower would topple over.  

Now - on to the food.  I did get to try the Shou Lai Mian (hand pulled noodles) this time around.  There are 3 soup bases to choose from.  I opted for the Szechuan Beef - the only one with actual chunks of protein in it.  It was quite tasty - think udon noodles.

Things that showed up on my plate:

From the Salad Bar:
Chickpea Salad
Gherkin Pickles
Seaweed Salad (not the Wakame variety)
Corn ""Salad""
Cabbage Salad

Everything from the salad bar tasted the same.  Drenched in a sweet\/sour vinaigrette of some sort.  The corn salad was horrible - stay away!  It was definitely canned corn, and there was zero flavour, and an even more awful texture!  Eek!

Proteins:
Braised Tilapia - Quite tender and flavourful
King Oyster Mushrooms - If you want an oyster-sauce high, this is the dish.  Just drenching!
Salmon Teriyaki - Not tender and very dry.  Even the sauce couldn't save it
Shrimp Dumplings - Quite good, though the dumpling wrapper could stand to be a bit thinner
Peking Duck - They ran out of wraps when I was there, so I just escaped with the bird part.  Flavourless and the skin was not crispy
Yam Potato Cakes - A gelatinous, round, orange disc that was quite delicious
Grilled Pineapple - Can't really screw this one up!
Egg Tofu w\/ Black Bean Sauce & Minced Pork - Egg tofu is extremely smooth, in one word - tasty!

Sushi Bar - I would avoid this station altogether as their sushi tasted rather ""stale"" to me.  The lack in skill shows as the sushi falls apart.  The sashimi items (tuna and salmon) are not the freshest.  Save your stomach for the dessert bar instead.

The dessert bar is huge.  Bread pudding, cheesecake, nanaimo bars, creme brulee, tofu fa (silken tofu w\/ maple syrup), jello, various fruits, ice cream cake, green tea mousse cake, rice pudding, sugar puffs, chocolate dipped strawberries, fruit tarts... the list goes on and on and on.  This would be a dieters ultimate nightmare!  But for a sweets lover like me I was in heaven.

They have this weird rule for big groups that once 30 minutes have elapsed you must settle your bill.  Tacky!  One of the 2 tables that our group occupied was also not provided hot hand towels at the end of the evening.

nPsarCbgcdjzg8keTG2iwQ,PP-bu7WpTcqENIDhmeKj3w,dHaI3mS8kPW-KVmeLdzzmw,2017-03-31,"First meeting was in Jan.  Spent an hour picking out floor tile, backsp and counters.  We realized that Holly had lost our info (WE followed up). She didn't have the order, needed to be reminded.  We reiterated we needed samples.  When the samples came, she only ordered 2\/3.  Samples of the backsp did not match what we thought we ordered. I took a photo of it when onsite, and sent to her to prove it.  She asked the manuf. to send her pics.  We looked at the pics and picked new tiles from those.  Holly got sick (which I do not fault her) and it seemed like she only communicated at 4:45 on Friday to ask a critical question (they close at 5), and then we'd not hear back.  Were convinced she only worked Friday from 4-5.  Understood you are limited when ill.  When ill, people should source a backup to take care of their customers and fill the min amount of duties to keep going.  Most people when coming back from being sick and have a backlog will put in extra time to catch up, because it's right.  Harkey will let work get several weeks behind without follow up, not their problem.  I continued to check in, and magically she realized that the warehouse did not have the full qty we ordered of this 2nd tile.  At that point, we declined to do that part of the backsp due to the hassle.  We switched to a similar version at the Tile Shop.  They had the product in 2 days.  The floor tile was next.  When the order came in, it was 2 boxes short.  Installers realized it.  Not certain if this was because the contractor miss measured.  Once again, our problem as we had installers ready to finish the floor. Ended up having to take off work and run around to find a distributor that had it.  I'm not even sure if Harkey was aware, we took it out of their hands because it wouldn't get dealt with due to responsiveness. Side note - when we picked up the floor tile, they told us to come back the next day to get the pencil tile (a diff part of backsplash). I took off lunch to go to Harkey to get that tile, but when I got there they had to ask Holly about this (who was not on the phone), and she at no point got up from her desk.  She sent someone to tell me to come back, tile wasn't in.  At that point we also cancelled the pencil and switched it to the Tile Shop.  Now countertops.  The originals came in, and to their credit (fabrication), they noted swirling in the stone.  They asked me to come down and take a peek, and I saw that it looked bad.  We used that trip to pick out new ones.  Ordered that afternoon.  They called and wanted to discuss the cuts.  The stone they sold us the 2nd time was not available in the correct size.  They sold a quartzite stone that comes in a size under 63"" (rare) and we needed 63"" to have barstools under it.  They called to confirm it was OK to cut off 3"" of the island.  This would then make the island not barstool depth.  I told them I needed to discuss with my husband, and we want the island look strange when we had planned for seating, we decided to go elsewhere to find stone.  3rd time is the charm - went to AGM.  The last thing that Harkey was responsible for is still in progress.  We ordered painted tiles (also a part of the original backsp and the only thing not moved over to the Tile Shop).  Contractor picks them up.  Harkey says they checked them.  We checked the first box and confirmed.  The 2nd box was opened by the installer, and confirmed 2 were chipped.  The 2nd box appeared to be in original shipping, unchecked. These tiles run $80 each.  They are made on demand, hence they have no stock (not explained earlier).  Instead of re-ordering to moving, they went back and forth with the manuf. to prove the damage.  Sorry, but that's your supplier.  You can take the damage up with the manuf., especially when you did not check the box.  This cost us 4 days of getting this resolved and new tiles shipped, and when it was agreed to that the manuf would ship new, it would be 10 days min.  There is a good chance of one of those getting broken again.  They say now that they won't stand behind the tile if we cut a hole for a pot filler so if they don't stand behind tiles that ship or cut well?  Before all this happened we referred a few people to Harkey and they have decided to do business elsewhere with similar stories.  MGMT:  If you are not into selling tile or being educ on the process\/products, then I would stick to fabrication where you have a good rep.  Don't sell tile if you hire people that are incompetent.  When you go home to your clean house, your customers are living in dust waiting for you to follow up on mistakes.  Others go the extra mile, especially when they are causing mistakes.  With fabrication we had no issues once we finally got a stone.  Harkey was flexible in dates for install, but I don't think I'd use them again.  We've spent money with them on other projects, but we've also met a lot of great resources in the Charlotte area on this project that want the business more.",Shopping

The two stars are for the facility and the customer service. Everyone was well-rehearsed on their sales pitch and information on their products although I would really like to see exactly what is in their ""super shots"", such as a COA or something- but I'll get to that in a minute.

Because the reviews that are actually warning people of what this place is really about (your money) and how it really operates (sales pitch, bait and switch, etc) are on the further back pages I decided to leave a piece of my experience and opinion in here for those that are actually wanting to educate themselves first before handing these people a penny for something they can easily give themselves for free.

When you go in, their office smells really nice and had ongoing testimonial ads for their anti-aging regimes on flat screen TV's and courteous receptionists suited up in scrubs like any other professional medical facility. Unfortunately, although I was told to come in with paperwork prepared (which I did, always the model patient) and scheduled it same-day for 4:30 pm. on a Wednesday- it still took quite a while for me to get taken into their exam room where they take down your height and scan your body on scale to measure water, BMI, body fat percentage, and resting metabolism. They print out everything to where it looks pretty cool and also puts your insecurities into black and white numbers format.

As you stare at this printout of your flaws for the 45 minutes it takes for the diet coach to come in and explain some of it (he actually only took my printout to write down what he wanted to sell me on, and he should probably learn how to spell Protein if he's going to hustle it) to you, the desperation to ""fix"" yourself builds and builds. This allows whatever they offer or suggest to seem really awesome and sparkly all of a sudden. Mind you, I am 24 and of an average, healthy weight even if slightly over for my height. So he was pretty curt in letting me know right away he could have me lose 20-30 pounds in 3 months with the weekly supershots and ""diet"" for $104, and if that isn't fast enough, then add these diet pills (Topamax and Fentamine (sp?) to the mix for almost a hundred bucks more (200 bucks more if you do not have a student ID apparently) and it would be 2 months.

All I could think of in my mind was the Ellen Burstyn character in Requiem for a Dream, where she's completely overtaken by this obsessive goal to lose weight and ruins her life with diet pills. While that is semi-dramatic, I will say that what the diet coach was describing was no different than the effects of meth. I won't knock them like they don't work, I'm sure they do, but for a 24-year-old with no kids or health issues (He had asked about my thyroid. Really?), it's just...

Unnecessary. 

Like a lot of what they sell. And seeing people before me who have spent up to $1200 for meals and HcG, it's just really sad. I'm sure the people who have left 5 stars and have lost X amount of pounds with Trimbody MD feel really satisfied, but they were left out on the same secret that this diet coach left out for me as well: You can pretty much do all of this and more on your own without any of this crap, if you really stick to it and do your research.

So I did my research and I'm very happy to not have been duped by these people. When he gave me the ""options"" of doing the supershots groupon or the supershots\/pills, there was a moment where he just froze and looked at me like he was just so impatiently waiting for my wallet. There was no, ""Maybe you want to think about it, because you're really young and not unhealthy enough to really need to enhance what you're already doing"". Because mind you again, I have already started eating more low-fat, veg\/fruit, no fastfood\/alcohol\/sugary indulgences- which, by the way, you can go to any grocery store and figure it out on your own without handing these people a dime.

The diet consult part of the groupon is just the Paleo diet, which I haven't cosigned to any named diet so I cannot say it wouldn't have been successful, but it sounds like they don't often consult you after you hand over your credit card. You can also look up this diet or any other information online... for free!

Again, I'm glad people have had success with this company but it's more than likely a placebo effect when they would have gotten the same results with regular activity, lower fat\/sugary foods, and supplements that are much cheaper in a regular, labeled form- whether it's in a powder or a capsule, there are much more verifiable and safer options that won't break your bank out there. This place is a sales center and I could smell it just from their website. Beware!

lVYeVlXdqeuKluNFrKI3lA,zDOy8P5GqrMbbOLWY7IqWQ,_sszHLYUzwFFMWh6qBuPnw,2013-11-19,"Communication prior to wedding was really great; I knew what I wanted and expressed spec. styles, was reassured it could be done.

Me, my mom & my mother-in-law had hair & makeup done by them.  

They were prompt.  Literally at 7:01 AM the doorbell rang.  I had makeup done by Celina & hair by Courtney.  I had my m\/u done first.  I showed her various pictures of what I was looking for and didnt look like any of the sample pictures, nor did I like my look at all.  I didn't get a good look at myself because right after she finished, I went to the hair chair.  It was only until after that I noticed that:
a) my got tons of glue on my lower lashes
b) my foundation was uneven
c) my blush and eyeshadow weren't blended perfectly, so there were harsh lines
spectacular.  
d) some of my eyeliner was sparse and moving

I did the airbrush foundation.  I didn't like it.  It looked like a lighter coverage that what I normally use and that's tinted moisturizer.  It didn't rub off on my clothes.

MIT 702 makes strong claims about how they are the ""only"" co. that does a lot of things, so I want to be clear on what they do provide.

They offer a touch up to go kit.  This kit consists of a sponge for face, an eyeshadow applicator and a free lipgloss.  I don't use powder regularly and she recommended I use powder to keep my face looking good for so many hours, so I had to get my cousin to make a quick trip to sephora.  

Regarding the lipgloss, it wasn't a color I would have chosen, but literally she had a dozen tubes of this ""universally flattering"" lipgloss that she gave to me, my mom & my mother-in-law.  My mom actually refused to wear it because she felt awkward having the same color as me & used her own lipstick instead.  The lipgloss definitely wasn't 15 hr proof, it was gone after I had my first glass of champagne in the limo & nonexistent in 90% of the pictures.

As for the lashes, I used my own because the ones they had were super long & looked too fake.  Re the lasting of the makeup, I was done at 10:15AM & got home just past midnight.  My eye makeup was still on, but had caked, my blush & foundation looked a bit sloppy.  I did have a long day, sweated, etc.

My mom hated her makeup.  She said that the one time I did her makeup looked a lot better than what they did.  I didn't think my mom looked any better than when she normally does her makeup (& she is hard of seeing).

My mother-in-law looked great.  Celina seemed hesitant to use lashes on her bc her natural lashes are so blond and she has light hair, but she was excited about them, so used them anyway.  She looked good.  She didn't look over the top or anything, a very natural look, which is similar to what she normally wears.  

Hair
My mom has thinning hair & I had e-mailed ahead to let them know this.  She usually uses a product to add fullness and forgot it in NY.  I also emailed ahead about this.  The stylist (Courtney) emailed me back telling me to check out Sally's for the product but we didn't have enough time.  She did was she could, but unfortunately the product she had was grey and my mom had light brown hair with dark low lights.  Considering the circumstances, her hair looked good & held up throughout the day & night.  She wanted to add some brown, but the makeup artist said the only way would be to break an eyeshadow and she didn't want to do that because she didn't think it was worth it.  She also said this after going on about how she buys all types of things and writes them off on her taxes.  It isn't how I would have acted in her position, but completely understand her stance, though she could have been more professional in her wording & demeanor.

Despite telling me she couldn't do my hair in the fashion that Megan had told me was a go, she still did a good job.  My hair held well throughout the day and I was able to work it a little into what I wanted for the night.

My mother in law's hair was fantastic.  She has beautiful, thick, luxurious & plentiful hair, so admittedly was a great canvas to work with, but her hair was great & lasted the entire day.

My only commentary regarding the hair is that we all had the same colored bobby pins used on us and given to us for ""touch ups,"" yet my mother in law has blond and red hair, my mother has light to medium brown hair and my hair is jet black.

Overall, these girls were both on time, super chipper & friendly.  I would rate hair an A- and makeup a C, at best.  Another additional commentary is that Celina, the makeup artist was done before Courtney the stylist was done.  She collected the money & said she had a day full of bookings so had to be on the go.  This is why I wasn't able to point out issues with my makeup to her.  Courtney stayed about a good 30 mins after that.  I thought this was weird & unprofessional.  

They sent me emails to write reviews on wedding sites, when I did, the review was disputed, so beware of what may be a false positive in the rankings. Solid 2.5 here.",Beauty
N_BbSL34x6kwwlgMkMxrDQ,lu0yFch9d6Vhx8pKEwhYZA,Ym2oKbCwwHQt90oxefblXw,2017-06-15,"I have been getting my lashes done for about a year now and have always had 3 weeks of retention between fills. Before I moved to Vegas, I wanted to find my next go to lash lounge so naturally, I turned to Yelp! This is where I discovered Sassy Lashes and their IG, and saw the amazing work that Shauna's artists have done for plenty of ladies. After following them for a few months before my actual move, I was set on making this my go to, hopeful that my first lash artist was my last, ready to tell all my friends about this place, and of course be one of the many happy customers to write a 5-star review. Unfortunately, things did not end happily for me like they have for all these other ladies that I see dropping 5-star reviews - some who seem to have even created a Yelp account just to write them.

Upon my arrival to Vegas after over 72 hours of overseas travel\/delays, a non-stop, 10 hour drive by myself into town, beaten but not broken, I immediately went online to schedule an appt that I'd hoped would bring life back to not only my lashes, but me. The process was easy and I'd thought about commenting on IG to schedule an appt with someone in particular, but instead I booked online and let life decide the rest. The place on Fort Apache was a bit of a challenge to find, but eventually I did find it. When I arrived 10 minutes before my appt, there was nobody to be found in the front office and all the doors inside were closed. There were men working on a situation that happened prior to my arrival who were also looking for anybody who worked there. I texted the same number I was already texting when trying to find the place and they let me know there was one artist currently working and that they would be back soon. All in all, I waited just about 20 minutes total, 10 past when my appt was scheduled until I was brought in. The lash artist apologized and repeatedly talked about how many lashes the customer before me had. Understandable.

My lash artist at me down and asked what it is I wanted. I told her, and immediately, she got to work. As usual, we talked a bit and I fell asleep for a while. By the time I woke up, she was done and my lashes looked amazing. I paid and was on my way for the day.

The big reasons this review is happening is 1. Almost all the lashes that were put on had fallen off by day 7. 2. Prior to this I respectfully reached out to Shauna (the business owner) herself to let her know about my particular situation, in hopes that she would value my feedback and maybe she would help me remedy my horrible experience by putting me with a different lash artist, but that is not what happened at all

As mentioned at the beginning of my review, I have always had 3 week retention. I have my foaming lash shampoo I use every other morning, I sleep on my back, I only touch my lashes with the fluffy wand, etc. I know how to take care of my lashes. By day 3, I already had gapping. By day 7, almost all of them had fallen off. By day 9, I decided to reach out to Shauna but she only reacted badly and assumed I was blaming her for my bad experience. I was not and never did. I simply informed her of what happened and how all the attached lashes fell off - I know the difference between an eyelash that has shedded and extensions that have unattached.

I am really not one to complain, which is why I waited so long to reach out to the owner about my experience and before taking time out of my day to write this review. It was just so bad that I wanted to make sure that someone else who might be contemplating about their next go to place sees more than just all these 5 star reviews. Lashes are affordable, but not at all cheap.

Apparently Sassy Lashes has an amazing 3 day policy that you sign for when you sit down for your appt, where you are free to come back if you are unhappy with your lashes in any way and these ladies will fix you up (not to mention, with a different artist from your previous one of course) completely free of charge. Due to all that was happening in my life prior to and following my lash appt, this tiny, tiny tidbit that I had signed for had slipped my mind. In addition, this is the ONLY place I have been to that has had such a great policy so I simply was not used to having that warranty on my lashes at all. If I wasn't in such a hectic place in my life at the time my lash appt happened, I would definitely have not forgotten about it. I tried my best to make Shauna see this, but she clung to her policy and kept repeating that if it was 3 days out she would have taken care of me but now that it is 9 and I am lashless, there was nothing she could do. Between her repeating the policy, she did offer me a discount on a 30 minute fill, but then I would be back in less than a week or 2.

So in the end, nothing was done to actually remedy my experience. Due to the incomparable and AMAZING work I see other artists doing here, I may be back (with a different artist of course) but I just don't know.",Beauty
F4o6QHf6L5Pmj1Hp-FKZdA,orh0HRUNCWuQMt9Iia_osg,dIN5IF2bSHeASjPFJBhshw,2017-10-18,"Grand opening: 40% off? Sign me up! Grandpa and I actually took the subway up. It was surprisingly easy, given that this place is like a 3 minute's walk from Eglinton Station.

I'd been to Kanda once during their soft opening, and had given the owners some feedback. They're actually really responsive in that regard. When I came back for the grand opening, they'd fixed some of the issues! While there were a number of service issues on Grand Opening day, I get it. Nothing drastic happened. No one dropped food in my lap, no one yelled at me, and I didn't find anything gross in my food. It just took a little longer than I would have expected. From the comments everyone else seems to have gotten on their reviews, it looks like Kanda is going to be fixing up those issues anyways.

Grandpa and I ordered more food than we could eat. I mean, 40% off? EAT ALL THE FOOD. I had wanted to sit at a 4 person table with better lighting so I could take pretty pictures and have all the food on the table, but given how busy they were soon after we started ordering, I can see why they refused.

Maguro tataki, which even at regular price, is a pretty good portion. 7 pieces for $8.99. The pieces aren't like thinly sliced beef tataki either. They're thick enough to have some chew. Next time, I'm going to try the beef or the salmon tataki. Tuna is pretty, but I get bored easily, and I've had their tuna twice now. I very seldom order anything twice consecutively at restaurants, especially if they have a large menu.

Rainbow oshizushi - shrimp, tuna, salmon? It was supposed to be 8 pieces, but I think they cut it wrong, so I had 6 slightly awkwardly large pieces. I let them know about the error, received an additional 10% off on top of my 40%, and saw that they had fixed it by dinner service (stalking Instagram foodies to the max!) This was Grandpa's favorite dish of the day, and he usually doesn't like to eat sushi with rice (sashimi kinda guy). I like how there's a smokey flavor to their oshizushi. I also like how they incorporated the avocado in your typical rainbow roll into it not by placing the avocado on the top and then torching it, but putting it in one of the rice layers. I'm not at all a fan of cooked avocado, so this works really well for me.

Spicy salmon and avocado donburi - I believe this was $9.99 regular price on their lunch menu. It was not spicy and the portion was on the smaller side, but still good for the discounted price. I really like the container they used to plate it as well. It was one of those round sushi trays. I can see the presentation being gorgeous if they work it well.

Unagi roll + Sushi pizza - This one's a lunch special combo. You can pick two of a number of sushi options including rolls, sushi pizza, or torched sushi, and the two plus soup and salad, if I recall correctly, will cost $9.99. It's a good deal at $9.99. It's a great deal with that discount (but what isn't?) The two dishes came separately, and there was some space between the two coming, but I was taking a bunch of pictures, so it's not like my table was ever without food. The unagi roll had avocado in it, which is a plus in my books! The sushi pizza had chopped salmon and tobiko on it, and it was rather pretty. There was also a decent ratio between the fish on top and the rice on the bottom. I know sushi pizza isn't traditional, but I really like it. A sushi pizza like this costs like $9-$11 at other places, and I got that and an unagi roll for $5 during grand opening. Talk about a cheap eat...

Black garlic shoyu ramen - Yet another thing I had during visit 1 that I ordered again visit 2. I have yet to figure out what's shoyu about this, but it takes like black garlic tonkotsu to me. Given that tonkotsu is their base broth, if I'm not mistaken, this makes sense. There's a definite garlic aroma coming off these noodles. Egg was softboiled. There were two very large slices of cha shu and they were tender and delicious. Grandpa's second favorite dish right here. I really like it because it's not as salty as ramen places. I can actually drink the soup here.

In hindsight, I regret not ordering more food. I should have gotten a ton of sashimi (botan ebi, anyone? scallops? uni?) Their mackerel was amazing my first visit. I also regret not ordering their okonomiyaki, and their black swan roll was unavailable during lunch, so I guess I'm going to be making a return visit soon!

Bonus for those who have read this far: Spider hand roll (softshell crab) is $3.99 regular menu. Good amount of crab. I'd ask for it without Cajun seasoning though.",Restaurant

     To preface, I've been a fancy salon connoisseur my entire life, visiting the best salons in the Chicagoland and Detroit-metropolitan areas (I'm rather new to Cleveland). I'm by no means wealthy, but I prefer to seek out spas that generally have higher price-point, because in my experience these places house more experienced, knowledgeable, and professional stylists. Of course, top-notch stylists work in all types of salons at various price-points, but I've never really had the time or money to burn trying to find those stylists by chance. In short, I will pay top dollar for the very BEST haircut along with the very BEST service. Anything less simply does not fly with me. With that said, my boyfriend picked this spa for me when he bought me a gift card for my birthday; therefore, I walked in with absolutely no expectations and an open mind.

     Danielle cut my hair and Kate waxed my brows. I have very long hair and thick brows, so I let them have at it to anything that they wanted. The result? Perfection. Danielle took a curling iron to my hair and gave it a nice curl without any direction from me. Taking the extra care to give me a nice style for the day rather than the normal round brush blowout was an unexpected and much appreciated touch. I'm going to be honest here: what I secretly always want my hair to look like (but am too ashamed to ask for) is the long, layered Kardashian cut with the long, middle-parted bangs, and lo-and-behold when Danielle was finished, that's EXACTLY what I saw in the mirror. It took everything in me to not freakin' SQUEE. The staff was very friendly, with no uppity attitude or clientele in sight. Did my stylist make a comment about how it's obviously been a year since I've had this uncontrollable mane chopped? Nope! That is not to say that this isn't a classy, clean spa. I REALLY value that vibe. Honestly, despite how good the stylists may be, I do not return to places that make me feel not cool\/pretty\/highfalutin enough to be there. On top of everything, I was in and out within the hour. No fuss. No drama. My time is really important to me. More times that not I find myself really bored and irritated whenever I'm having my hair or nails done. Knowing I can visit this spa on my day off and still have time to run errands, go shopping, and write Yelp reviews means everything to me.

    Let's get to the nitty-gritty: $65.00 for my haircut and $15 for my brows was on point, personally. Anything more expensive makes me less inclined to buy products (I've been catching the scent of this Moroccanoil hairspray while typing this, and it is seriously delicious!) and to schedule follow up appointments for needed maintenance. Kate advised me not to pluck or alter my eyebrows until our next appointment, which is advice I'm excited to take considering I didn't spend $35 on an eyebrow arch that I'm inclined to stretch out because it cost so much. It's pretty neat to find an esthetician with a plan and vision for my brows. Frankly, it made me feel pretty special. O:-) 

     I'll be back for a highlight and a brow wax. If I'm still over-the-moon with this place after that, the search will be over and Zen will be MY Cleveland salon.",Beauty
a3ebHV0R5aRSsjn5Zz5U3Q,VEUJxnrPoxRtYV3t5LK3WQ,O1-s69NwAGhQ_rpzBvbjOw,2014-05-08,"This store needs to hire a professional manager with a customer and employee focused background.  It is clear from the reviews and recent interactions that this store does not value either of its greatest assets.  

My brother Shovel S. posted his own review of his experience with this store.  He was laying flooring and wanted to rent a floor sander in order to level some rough spots on the concrete before laying hard flooring.  When he asked for this tool from tool rental the employee hooked him up with a floor scraper, the kind of device you would use to remove Kool Deck.  He went home, read the manual and realized it is not the right tool for the job and went back asking to exchange for the right tool.  The tool rental clerk and then an assistant manager were very rude to him and charged him over $100 because he left the store with a tool, even though it was the wrong tool and he didn't\/couldn't use it.  As if he is supposed to know what Home Depot's iteration of two such similar tools looks like there at the tool desk all wrapped up.  He was just trying to get a job done on his precious weekend off.  

After much argument with the assistant manager who insisted that it was store policy to take his money without providing him the proper tool, he left the store with $109 less dollars than he walked in with and his day wasted.  At this point he made a post to social media and I got involved.

As a management professional, his story was so appalling that I was compelled to call the corporate number to get to the bottom of why if a tool rental employee gives a customer the wrong tool the customer ends up stuck paying for leaving the store with the employees mistake.  The company does not have this policy in any other department.  I have returned dead plants, half used cleaning products that didn't really work as advertise etc and had no hassle.  Why would an unused rental tool be the subject of such a hard-line policy?

While talking to corporate I gave them the store number for the location in Tempe by accident since they are on the same street.  The manager from Tempe called me within half an hour but I realized it was the wrong store.  I called corporate with the correction.

Meanwhile the Tempe manager was quite appalled by what happened and made efforts to get the Laveen manager to make the situation right.  The Tempe manager called my brother to reach out.  The Laveen manager remained silent.  Not a peep.  I originally called corporate because the Laveen assistant manager claimed the hard-line policy on the tool rental was a corporate policy.  According to the Tempe manager this is not true.

I called to let them know that in the age of social media I and 200 of our friends had already seen his post about his experience being robbed and then insulted by the Home Depot manager.  We happened to have 2 birthdays in our friend groups this past week and at both events this experience was openly discussed.  I also told my neighbor across the street who I am close with.  We are big time gardening enthusiasts and we maintain our yards as well as the yards of a couple of elderly and part time resident neighbors on our street just to keep the neighborhood beautiful.  I spent nearly $1000 on plants and pool opening products this week and none of was purchased at HD as a result of this experience.

The manager at the Laveen store STILL didn't call me or my brother back, despite my brother calling the manager repeatedly and my lodging a formal complaint with corporate and even accidentally getting the Tempe store manager involved!  This is uncalled for.  Every day this unprofessional manager held my brothers money and did not reach out to resolve what should never have been a problem to begin with was another day we talked, the saga continued to unfold on social media and now onto Yelp and the manager continued to not reach out.  

Finally, more than 48 hours later, fed up with being in limbo, having had the Tempe manager offer money out of his own pocket because of how ridiculous the situation was, my brother made a last call to Laveen and was finally able to talk to the manager.   The manager did not call my brother; he had to call and leave messages repeatedly, have corporate leave messages and have the Tempe manager make calls on his behalf and finally get through because of his own efforts.  

The manager did process a refund of the $109 but the fact that it took 2 days and numerous phone calls and multiple people involved speaks of a highly ineffective manager with employees not even empowered to ""make it right"".  If you value your project time, shop at Lowe's or Tempe Home Depot.  This store doesn't have its act together and needs to invest in training.  With all of the hassle they put my brother through, leaving him with his project still undone, it is my opinion that they owe him more than just a refund.  If I was the manager he would have gotten a refund and 24 hours with the right tool on me.",Shopping
gaSV9-hBR4UiuGLhQNr8tw,ag0E0EeDAcVAHPiJg9ft2Q,lUG4i-s3zNFY1f6bEnTfqg,2012-05-06,"UPDATE: Wow, Snapdragon is really getting busy these days!  Too bad that means that I was rescheduled again and again- mainly in the form of being notified that I had to see someone different than who I scheduled with.  And, that was despite booking out months in advance in response to having been rescheduled so many times.  I get it- doing certain events\/clients pays more than my simple root touch up.  But, I get my hair done every three weeks and every few months have a complete highlight done and I tip appropriately.  So, doesn't it add up to being worth keeping the appointments with me?  And, shouldn't the respect of keeping appointments set with clients take top priority, anyway, regardless of any of that?  

At any rate, I hope to find a stylist here who does as great a job with my color, since that's my main concern- my cut is fairly simple, I think- but whose schedule isn't so busy that I'll get bumped for higher priority events\/clients.  I'm trying one more appointment to see how it goes before, sadly, seeking another salon.   If it happens, I'll update with info about my experience!

+++++++++++++++++++  

It really can't get much better than this!  I called to make an appointment for a fairly complicated change in my hair color and style.  I have dark hair and wanted to go lighter and possibly do highlights with an ombre style, too.  The stylist, Jenny, asked if I'd like to come in that day for a free consultation so that she could see my hair and let me know what the price would be and get an idea of what I wanted.  The consult was very professional and friendly.  The salon is in a good location and extremely cute with a laid back atmosphere.  One good sign was that I liked the hair styles of all the stylists there and every client that was finished while I was there.  I was SO excited to go back the next weekend for my new style.

The service was flawless!  My very dark hair with dry ends and various regrowth\/roots\/old highlights, was lightened without harsh bleaching.   My new, lighter brown color is fantastic!  I emphasized that I did not want reddish highlights, which seem to always be part of having highlights in dark hair... and I got exactly what I wanted- highlights with not a trace of maroon\/orange.  The ombre has lightened over this week beautifully just like Jenny said they would.  I got SO many compliments!  She was not only able to do what I requested- but it was even BETTER than I imagined.  She has the creativity to suggest styles and colors, which is very important to me... I want a stylist, an ""artist"" with some vision to help me know what will look best, not just a robot to do what I say even it won't look good on me!  I would have probably cut my hair much shorter- but she was able to suggest a layered look around my face that gave me what I wanted without having to lose much length.  Nice!!

If you're looking for a fantastic salon with reasonable prices, great atmosphere, and truly talented stylists, THIS IS IT.  I booked for my touch-up before I even left.  AND, I want to mention this, because it's one of my biggest pet peeves with most salons, I was NOT upsold on hair products I don't need.  I did leave with a root touchup product but it was because *I* asked about how to take care of roots and the product was reasonably priced and a genuinely great recommendation.  They have Bumble and Bumble products and will answer whatever questions you have- but they don't do the annoying upsell and you won't be pressured to add ""extras"" to your service\/bill.  

If you've read my other reviews, you know that I've had some hard times with finding a good salon in Tucson OR Phoenix... well, I found it!  So, please keep this place busy and successful.  But, don't take my appointments with Jenny!",Beauty
g9GRAvHIG_bCWIY87cuVew,3raZKdKfivKhBPa64KGL_Q,5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,2015-03-29,"Oh Green, how do I love thee....so much that I fantasize about salads and tsoynamis.  I've been to both the Tempe and Phoenix locations, including the cafe\/bakery\/sister restaurant, Nami. I am a 23 year vegetarian,  part time vegan. My SO is a Nebraska bred, meat and potatoes kinda guy. We both love Green. I'm convinced,  if you don't like Green, there's something broken in your mouth...now the important stuff...
Ambience. ...hip, funky, casual, sometimes hectic...and all in a good way. Not intimidating.  No too hippy dippy. Just clean, bright, and creative. There's tons of seating inside and at the Tempe location,  a patio. The staff are 99% of the time cheerful and friendly...on one occasion we got a surly server\/cashier but it wasn't bad enough to ruin our visit. 
FOOOOOOOD... Well where to start..i order the Ranchero salad every time I eat here. Tender, mixed baby greens, crunchy tortilla strips, carrot shreds, creamy ranch and Green's yummy yummy barbecue ""wings""...it's perfect. Speaking of wings...these are amazing. Meaty texture, zesty sauce and the cucumber ranch and veg that accompany it are refreshing and delicious.  This is my guy's go to. With the thyme fries...that are so crispy.... The perfect fry. We had the fries with chili once and unfortunately\/fortunately we decided it wasn't for us and that I make a far meaner, and superior veggie chili. Moving on....on my very first visit I tried the Kung pao with mock chicken noodle bowl and was not a fan. Watery, too sweet, too salty yet bland sauce, slightly too al dente noodles...it just wasn't what I expected.  We also split a  Wendy's pickle. It's a mock fried chicken cutlet with pickle and spicy vegan mayo. It was warm and soft and tastes so much like chicken I was slightly scared it was real..on subsequent visits, we tried the 'thee argentine poboy""...grilled mock steak and caramelized peppers and onions with mayo and a spicy sauce. The steak had crispy bits, tender bits and was so flavorful. I would've loved more vegetables. ..there were 2 pieces of pepper on the whole sandwich. .but the part that stands out the most, oddly enough was...the bun. The fluffiest, most perfect bun ever. I want every sandwich I eat to be on that bun. We also ate the BBBQ bacon burger. Veggie patty, portabella cap, bacon, bbq sauce,  mushrooms onions and mayo. This burger was so rich and delicious and big.  We split it and I couldn't finish my half. Green also offers daily, off - menu, specials. We got a Carne asada nachos, which were ok. Tasty, but not enough carne, and too many dry chips. The most recent special I tried was a rueben sandwich.  The sandwich was huge! Tons of Seiten steak, thousand island, vegan cheese and sauerkraut on rye. It came with fries, (you can get fruit, fries, coleslaw). Very tasty. My only beef is with the price tag. Both specials I tried were $12 which is $3+ more than the regular menu  items. Which isn't a lot by any means...but the specials i tried weren't Green's best dishes..
 At Green you can get water, or one of their delicious, refreshing drinks...lime, berry lemonade, iced tea, and vimto. I have no idea what vimto is..maybe it's vitmo..anyway..i don't know what it is, but I know it's red, mildly sweet and delicious. There's also some bottled kombucha, boxed water, other bottled juices as well as beer! on tap. Local favorites from 4 peaks brewery and more. And super reasonably priced. . $3 for a kiltlifter. 
  If by some chance you have any room left, do yourself a favor and get dessert. The s'mores tsoynami is so good. Creamy soft serve, chocolate, graham crumbs and rice fluff...soo goey. Ive had a lemon ginger tsoynami as well and it was scrumptious. You can buy pastries and other goodies too including take and bake cookies. And the desserts are reasonably priced too. Seriously. . $4.50 for a huge tsoynami.  Suck it DQ. 
  I almost forgot! Nami does sunday brunch and Monday through Friday breakfast and Green frequently holds special dinners...a carnivore conversion dinner, holiday meals..and Green and Nami cater.  
  I also wanted to mention a few details... 
 Ordering is done at a counter. You're given a number and a server brings you your food. You clear your own table. There are condiments like hot sauce and tamari available. The kitchen tries to use organic whenever possible. 
Long review short..i love Green.  It's delicious, vegan comfort food. Not even ""comfort food"". It's the food you, as a vegetarian,  dream about finding on the menu at a restaurant. No more crappy side salad and fries! No more frozen, did they cook this on the meat grill, veggie burgers! Enough of me typing...You should just go and love it too.",Restaurant
-3XKXnxUnEkiLQlvoeYp5g,Hi-pKEIjAoCz3gbUMIC91w,9Jwq_5MiTdnEg-YwdzKHSQ,2015-12-27,"Since having gone for a few massages, and recently another with my daughter, there are things I find too uncomfortable to continue dealing with, no matter how cheap the massage is.  An inexpensive, low frills massage option is a great idea, and I would encourage the owners to continue trying to perfect their service, but I would need to see some changes before I would return:

***ENCOURAGE COMMUNICATION***  I've never been introduced to my masseuse, let alone actually had the masseuse speak to me.  I feel rushed back to the dimly lit cubicle, where I'm never sure where to place my belongings.  This I could live with, but ***having no comfortable avenue for voicing my needs in regards to roughness, pain tolerance or sensitive areas is unacceptable.  At the very least, have clients select a number when they arrive indicating something like ""1 = be gentle"", ""2=be moderately gentle"" or ""3=do whatever it takes to beat the knots out"".  After my recent visit, the inside edge of my lower legs were sore, but bearable.  However, my daughter was in tears.  She could barely move for 2 days without wincing.  She tried to communicate this with her masseuse during the massage, without success.  Part of this was my fault for not forcing the communication.  I could have spoken to the helpful young lady at the front desk (I did mention this was my daughter's first massage, but I should have been far more direct).  I also should have skipped my own massage so I could watch for her comfort level, knowing from past experience that the masseuse will never inquire ""Is this ok?  How are you doing?""  In addition to feeling rushed to our cubicle and the lack of any effort re fact-finding on the part of the receptionist or masseuse, an added problem is the cubicle type of set up.  It's even more uncomfortable initiating conversation knowing that anything spoken above a very quiet whisper will be disturbing to the person on the other side of the divider, who will certainly hear every word.  After all, if I could clearly hear the guys back being slapped next door, he would have heard our efforts to discuss roughness.

***REINSTATE THE OPTION for a 30-minute full body massage***  Part of the reason I didn't communicate better at the onset was my confusion regarding the elimination of a 30-minute full body massage.  My first massage was 30-minute full body and was perfect.  It consisted of about 8 minutes head\/shoulders\/arms, 8 minutes feet\/lower legs and 10 minutes back.  The entire body got at least a bit of attention.  Now we  were told WE HAD TO CHOOSE between something like feet\/head or head\/back.  I was so confused.  I chose feet\/head (really missed having my back done), and head\/back for my daughter.  Her scalp massage ended up being skipped altogether.  What a mess.

***FIX THE HIGH STAFF TURNOVER***  I've come for 3 or 4 massages and have never been able to get the same person twice, because they've already left.  This means I cannot feel confident that my masseuse is familiar with my needs (not that they actually keep any kind of record...), nor do I have any consistency.  My first masseuse was great, my second was fair, my third not good at all.  I'd rather pay a bit more and feel confident my favorite masseuse will still be around next time!

***Staff Demeanor***  My first masseuse was sweet, and even kidded with me a bit in her limited way.  I hugged her and couldn't wait for the next visit, but she was gone.  The second was a bit more reserved, and the last two looked like they really resented being there.  One of them appeared fearful when our service was finished, and the other just seemed really unhappy to be there.  I felt like I was taking advantage of slave labor.  I know people have off days, and maybe this was theirs, but if your staff members are not happy, your clients will likely feel it.

On the plus side, the young lady at the front desk had apparently answered the phone when I called to make the appointment, and she was much easier to communicate with than the woman who had answered the phone in the past.  Communication is key!!

And the soft music being played during the massage was lovely.",Beauty
xlTb-vNDhlEszHURzbfcyQ,SgDp1EUkYBL9HcyklQmdNA,-sAr-LA9TsIdl37UjwBlvg,2017-03-23,"Our stay at The Clarendon Hotel and Spa was a mixed experience.  We had the same great, friendly service mentioned by many other people, especially in the restaurant.  The only meal we ate there was breakfast, so I can't speak to the other food they served.  The food was very good and there were different choices than you would normally find in a chain hotel. 

We got lucky because I made the reservation before the end of Jan 2017.  Their new rule is, if you make your reservations thru a travel site (I used Travelocity), you have to pay for parking and breakfast.  If you make your reservation on their website, parking is free and you get a $10 per person voucher for the restaurant.  All except one breakfast entrée was $7, and coffee was $3, so there you go - free breakfast.  The front desk person said that they will match the travel sites prices but that doesn't help if you use a travel site to bundle flight, hotel and\/or car rental.  

Now, on to the room.  Ours smelled like greasy deep fried food, and was definitely NOT a suite, by any RATIONAL definition.  I thought they put us in the wrong room by mistake, so I immediately called the front desk to ask about it.  The person told me that the Junior Suite is just a slightly larger room than usual, not an actual ""suite"".  I don't remember seeing that bit of info on the website.  I think they should come up with something else call this kind of room.  Our adult son came to stay with us, so I booked what I thought would give us more room and some privacy.  The room had two small beds that sagged in the middle and a teeny bathroom. 

Regarding the smell, my sister had the room right across the hall and it smelled fine.  I told someone at the front desk about it and she sent up a second bottle of Febreze.  I assume the first bottle was left over from the people who stayed in the room before we did, because it was half empty.  I noticed that the smell was different in the morning than in the evening, so I looked out the window and saw that we were directly above the kitchen air vent.  Unfortunately, I didn't discover this until the day before we checked-out.  DO NOT let them put you in Room 330 unless you want your clothes to smell like toast or tacos.  

The bathroom would probably be fine for a young person with good eyesight.  I am neither, so I couldn't see myself in the mirror.  The lighting is so dim, I thought I had turned on the night light instead of the actual bathroom lights!  The fact that the whole bathroom carried on the theme of dark gray walls probably made it worse.  Luckily, they offered a small lighted magnifying mirror on the desktop so my wife could see to put on makeup.  

While we were there, the closet doors fell off the tracks but housekeeping didn't send anyone to fix them.  I probably should have complained, but I was tired of doing so by that time, and we would be leaving in a couple of days.

The location was pretty convenient.  It was only a few blocks from the light rail line to downtown and the University.  The pool area, which I admit I didn't use, looked nice.  As some have mentioned, there is a huge whirlpool, so you don't have to bump knees with strangers when using it.  My wife and my sister spent the day in the pool area and there was an event there that they had fun with - the rollout of a new sunscreen by some guy in a speedo (who probably should have been wearing board shorts, from the pictures I saw).  The other thing that was fun was the rooftop bar.  We had drinks and appetizers and watched the sun go down one night.  The sunset was a bit blah because it went down behind some trees and buildings rather than the mountains.  The urinal in the men's room of the restaurant deserves mention.  I don't want to spoil it but picture a graphic that has been linked to The Rolling Stones' ever since their Sticky Fingers album.  Definitely one (actually two) of a kind, and in keeping with the eclectic nature of the hotel.  

Had it not been for our room experience, I would rate this hotel as a 4 or 5 star place.  Just don't expect a large well-lit bathroom or an actual suite, and stay away from room 330 and you'll probably really like the Clarendon Hotel and Spa.",Beauty
y7Jx7CzYIWRWjbjCQQYhXQ,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Yuw9XD4Mz56KwxlyO6VmbA,2017-08-07,"Apparently when one turns 30, your birthday celebrations get stretched out so for the final act, my sister offered me a meal at a restaurant of my choice. Given both of our enjoyment of trying new places, I figured this would be a good opportunity to try a relatively new restaurant in the city that has had lots of buzz, Marconi.

Opened last December by owners Mehdi Brunet-Benkritly and partner Molly Superfine-Rivera, this local duo came back to Montreal after having worked in New York. Mehdi, as a chef, had headed two kitchens in two Greenwich Village restaurants: Chez Sardine and Fedora. When in Montreal prior to his time in New York, he had worked at Toqué and Au Pied de Cochon so the pedigree was very interesting.

The room is definitely interesting visually. The space was apparently a former dépanneur and so they kept some original features. The most unique would be an old wooden fridge turned into the wine cellar. There is also a patterned tin ceiling, white-washed wall tiles, a beautiful wooden bar, an open kitchen and all sorts of electic accents - I'm partial to the cheetah frame above the bar. Noise levels are a little high but with the great background tunes played overhead, it isn't a problem. The vibe was great all night.

Superfine-Rivera is known for her cocktails so we had to start with a couple. Excellent balance for both. The 'Penicillin' had that smoky scotch note but with some sweetness and freshness from the ginger and honey. The Old Cuban had a similar sweet and fresh complex mixing rum with mint and green lemon. Great start.

The menu is relatively small and the plates are designed to share so we were recommended to get a few more than one each. No problem there! First up, a couple of bouchées - mimosa miso egg and cod croquettes. The eggs, served deviled-style, had a hint of the miso and a nice creamy texture. The croquettes were crunchy and very dense. The cod was delicious and the little mayo served it added some richness.

For true appetizers, we went with a trio. First, a plate of veal sweetbread with green peas, lemon puree and oxalis. I love sweetbreads so this was an easy sell for me. Beautifully golden and crunchy, these rich delights mixed with the zesty lemon was a nice pairing.

Next, the toast topped with whelk, bone marrow, aged cheddar and parsley was another hit for me. The mix of the whelk, the fatty marrow and the cheese worked surprisingly well. The bread had a nice crunch to it as well. My photography skills failed me here so no picture of this one. You will just have to take my word for it!

Last starter was a mixture of mushrooms served in brown butter with a poached egg. This was our favorite by far. The earthiness of the mushrooms came through so strongly and then you add the richness of the brown butter and the poached egg. Very lucious and a great finish to this course.

We slowed down a bit and went with only 2 mains. First was the ricotta gnocchi served with xeres, parmesan and basil. The gnocchi was good but personally not up to my standards when compared to another restaurants just a few streets over... however flavours were good, the xeres added some sweetness and the mountain of parmesan is always a welcomed addition. Solid dish.

The other main was the magret de canard served with burnt onion puree. The duck was cooked perfectly and had that great depth of flavour you want. I was very curious about the burnt puree - something I had never been exposed to before. Interesting texture overall with that slight charred texture coming through despite being pureed. The sweetness of the onions is still present but with a slight decrease in strength coming from the burning. Probably not everyone's cup of tea but I enjoyed it and it worked well with the duck.

After all of this, we still felt the need for some desserts so we took two. First, the bowl of white chocolate, rhubarb and pistachio was a nice combo of sweetness and tart but the cream at the bottom was more basil so the strong flavour that came through was basil instead of the others. Good but not quite what was stated. The other dessert was a lemon and creme verveine with oats. Very generous portion and excellent texture on the cream. Both rich and smooth with a nice lemon kick. The oats were good to bring some crunch.

As a finisher to my birthday celebrations, Marconi was an excellent way to go. The vibe was great, drinks excellent and the food very enjoyable. Mild complain would be the time it took to be served between each dish but clearly the approach was to serve each dish one at a time to split before next one which is fine but it made the service longer than we expected.  Marconi is a welcomed addition to the scene in Mile-Ex and definitely a place worth going back - not for birthday celebrations.

SJLInoS1625-P09uIHcamA,syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,2012-11-27,"*Review for the lunch buffet only*

My Indian buffet resume for Las Vegas thus far includes Saffron Flavors of India (Summerlin), Taj Palace (Henderson), and the neighborhood rival a few blocks down (Mint).  In general, what I look for in Indian buffets is value, variety, and flavor.  Thus far, I think Taj Palace wins in flavor, Mint has variety but seems to always underwhelm me in the flavor category, and Saffron is severely lacking in variety (no Tandoori chicken...I literally observed an angry customer lecture the waiter on the lack of tandoori chicken and then proceeded to order some on top of his buffet).  Not quite ready to proclaim India Masala as best one in town since I still need to cross off Mt. Everest and Namaste off the list, but for *value (see below) and variety, they deserve some props.  

In general, I have been surprised by the high prices for Indian buffets in Vegas compared to some other places I've lived (almost always in the double digit dollar range) and I'm at a point in my life where I no longer have the capability to polish off 3-4 plates + dessert to get my money's worth so just like an aging Greg Maddux who has to add some off-speed pitches to compensate for his slower fastball or Michael Jordan adding a fadeaway to his shot selection during the second half of his career, I too had to change up my game, and this buffet is ideally suited for my plan of attack.  

Back in college, when my roommate and I were short on cash, we would routinely compete to see who could pack the most food in the local Indian restaurant ""take out buffet"" styrofoam tray.  Over several trips, we came up with the ideal arrangement which consisted of wet items on the bottom, layer of rice to soak up some flavors but with dry side above, as much tandoori chicken as we could fit, then cushioning everything with naan and other odds and ends.  This ended up easily being the equivalent of 3-4 meals while preserving the integrity of of each item.   So when I showed up one day from my office with a short lunch break, I went with the buffet-to-go option and was ecstatic when they presented me  not only with the usual styrofoam tray, but packed my naan separately in tinfoil and gave me two additional styrofoam bowls....huzzah!  My college roommate would be nodding in approval as I packed my tray full bursting at the seams but now had two additional bowls which I could pack with soup, dessert, salad, or additional rice\/or any liquid item suitable for dipping my crispy warm naan.  All in all I foraged enough food to feed a small Indian village.

In terms of variety, this is a double edged sword since like other reviewers have mentioned, this can be hit or miss both in terms of quality (some dishes soared whereas others fell flat) and the expectation of seeing your favorite dishes being present on any given day is highly variable since they do a good job (perhaps too good) of rotating dishes in and out.  I've been here 3 times, and I've seen at least 2-3 distinct dishes not present from before including sauteed okra, fish curry, egg curry, goat curry, and the occasional indo-chinese food item (definitely get this when it is available).  The setup of the restaurant inside is very clean, spacious, and welcoming and for someone that appreciates variety, I like the fact that they take chances and have something for everyone, but not everything is for everyone.  It's an educational foodie experience to see the a wide spectrum of rice dishes, unique desserts, and breads that you won't know if you will like unless it's put forth in front of you.  One glaring omission from the buffet is the samosas since I have yet to see an appearance and while taste of specific items may not be superior to other buffets across town, it definitely edges out Mint head-to-head for the lunch buffet on the east side since they are not afraid to throw in some spice and I'd much rather the items err on being bold than being bland.  3.5 stars with an extra half star bump due to the hidden value in getting their buffet to go.",Restaurant
Y9KVHaCFxUrntfuk-MshGQ,4wp4XI9AxKNqJima-xahlg,cpy1TaCpp_E5aLMcYgzDHw,2014-05-22,"The saga continues. As you'll read from my previous post, we've had some pretty bad customer service from Levin since January. So bad that I felt compelled to write Mr. Levin himself (snail mail) and email Laurie (PA Director of Sales), the boss of Matthew (who we had a bad experience with at the Robinson store).

I also left a voicemail with Laurie on Saturday when everything went down with Matthew at the Robinson store. I hadn't heard from her on Monday yet, and then we got put in yet ANOTHER confusing situation with a call from a customer service rep asking when I wanted my furniture picked up. We hadn't even discussed having the furniture picked up and returned! Bad communication again.

I was surprised to get through to Laurie, as she answered right away. I was finally able to hear the apology I had been wanting from Matthew about the miscommunication. She told me she understood my frustration and wanted to fix the situation.

I made sure to stress that all I wanted was an apology, a promise to take action against the bad customer service I received from Matthew, and to replace the table. I felt better about the situation after I talked with her, as she offered me either store credit to buy a new dining room set, or a full refund, even though it had been over a year since we purchased the set (extenuating circumstances obviously). Very nice of her to offer a full refund in my opinion.

But the thing that still to this day is bothering me is something Laurie told me. She said that they had discontinued the table and whole line because people had similar situations with it cracking and\/or breaking like I had. She said they usually don't divulge that information to customers. I almost bought the same table to replace the cracked one. So they're selling tables that they know are defective still! Why would they let anyone purchase the last two faulty tables they had in stock? Just to make money? 

That's when I realized that they had lied to me when I had asked Lauren (our original saleswoman at the store) if I was making a mistake by purchasing the same table again (because I liked it so much), in case it would crack again. She said you could never say whether a table will crack or not crack. So pretty much, you take a chance purchasing any wood table with Levin because they'll possibly sell you faulty merchandise? I don't blame Lauren, per say, because she was so nice throughout the whole process (it was Matthew who was not nice). I assume that's what they tell her to say.

So what would have happened if they would have let me purchase that table and it would have cracked yet again? In my opinion. why would you lie to your customers, rather than just plain tell the truth? I'm sure it happens to the best company's, where they invest in merchandise that's faulty, and realize it later. But the difference is, do they take the time to fix the situation, or just gloss over it and hope no one complains like I did? 

I have to be honest, I was pretty torn. I really truly love the merchandise they sell. Up until now I had had a good experience with them. But this was such a horrendous experience, it was a tough decision. I told her I'd get back to her.

Laurie called me for the second time a couple days after we had spoken, even though she had said she wouldn't call again until I had made a decision about the furniture. She asked me if I had mailed Robert Levin a letter about the situation before or after we had spoken. I had mailed it before we talked, so there was no mention of me and Laurie speaking on Monday. She then told me, in her exact words: ""Robert would have called you, but he's on the road right now and he wanted to make sure that I called you."" Why wouldn't he just call himself when he was able to? I honestly would have liked to have heard from him. 

Her calling me this last time just seemed strange. But it actually helped make my decision, to return the complete dining set and get a full refund of my money. If Mr. Levin felt it was so important to call me, he could have done it himself. After that, a received a lightning fast call from customer service for them to pick up my merchandise and issue me a check when they come to my house. Looks like the communication is clear now. 

While I do appreciate they have given me a full refund on a set that was one month out of warranty, I find it shady business practices that they continue to sell that very table that was giving them problems. Plus, the very fact that it took me three months of go-rounds with the wrong people to get to the right person AND THEN be treated so rudely by the store manager, someone RUNNING an entire store, really just put me over the edge with them.

For that, I still have a sour taste in my mouth and do not plan on shopping at Levin again. It really is a shame. I know this might be a long shot, but I hope that they learn from this situation and become a better company. We'll see, only time will tell.",Shopping
1UXPwl-22yXwFvTclJxXsg,kZPL_fHvZ9P4XA_9C1NdRA,qNa3Cx05uSTQV9FaDms-Cg,2016-05-02,"I want to start off by saying that my stylist, Keira, is awesome. She is sweet, talented and quick. If I was her, I would run as far away from this place as I could ASAP. 
Thursday was the first time I""d been to Blow N Go. I had a great experience with Keira so I decided to come back today (Saturday) for another braid. My hair is washed and dry when I come in. I don't get a wash and blow-dry, just a braid, which is $15. Today, I wanted a crown braid with a messy bun. It took about 15 mins to do. As we were finishing up, Susanne (Susan?) the manager walked over and started critiquing Keira's work\/my braid. Without even asking me, she told Keira that she needed to fix this and fix that, use more hairspray and so on. This wasn't the look I was going for. I wanted it messy just like the picture, not like I was going to prom. I was very happy with it and told her this. If I was unhappy, I would have used my big girl words and said something. I also found it incredibly rude that she would chastise a stylist in front of their client\/on the floor (this wasn't the only time she did it while I was there). 
I left but came back a little later because one spot felt a little loose and I wanted to ask Keira if she could add a couple bobby pins to secure it. We went to her station and she told me that after I left she got in trouble because she didn't charge me enough. She said her manager told her that next time to charge me $30. She apologized profusely for this. Honestly, I wasn't happy about it but still planned on coming back because I loved my hair (both times) and how easy, convenient and fast it was. On my way out, Susanne (Susan?) the manager asked if she could talk to me. This is the part where Blow N Go, and unfortunately Keira, lost a client. 
Susanne began to tell me that she heard me and Keira talking. I said she was telling me the new prices. She said Keira is new, is still learning and charged me wrong. Since I was there for 30 mins (nope) I should have been charged $30 and for an updo not a braid. $15 is for a simple long braid and mine was up (not entirely accurate). I said that's not what the website states or what I was charged the last time I was in and it didn't take her 30 mins to do my hair. She said from the time I walked in to the time I left it was 30 mins, they hadn't changed things online yet and that she saw me on Thursday when I was there (if that's true, why not tell me before Keira started my hair today that prices had changed?). She said maybe she could do $20 instead of $30 for me but Blow N Go is under new management and the owner told her if they don't start charging more money for services they're going to go out of business. She said she needs her job and doesn't want to lose it. She actually asked me if I wanted everyone there to lose their jobs and how would I feel if that happened!!!!!! She said Groupon is killing them and they can't afford to charge so little. She said maybe when they get busier they can lower their prices (ha!). She then went on some tangent about losing $1000 on a vacation she was supposed to go on but had to cancel at the last minute because she had to manage the shop. At this point, I stopped her and told her that none of that was my business or problem and it was very unprofessional of her to tell me everything she just did. She apologized but told me she wanted me to know these things because she didn't want me to leave mad. I told her I wasn't and am not mad but think our conversation and the way she handled this situation was wrong and based on that, would not be back. She said ok have a nice day. Yeah. 
News flash: airing your place of work's dirty laundry, attempting to emotionally manipulate a customer, doubling the price of a regular customer's service and openly critiquing employees is bad for business. Its a shame because this place has so much potential.",Beauty
SuJbq0qjYppoUjYH1utETQ,JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,AoGCnRtwifZ2gTGHtg8KTw,2012-05-15,"Like I suspected, the low ratings of this place was due to how typical and bitter the locals in this particular area are. 

I refer to this area of NW Vegas as the ""Cheyenne Strip"".  The ""Cheyenne Strip"" starts at the intersection of Cheyenne and Durango, and ends at the 215. The yelpers who live in this area are the harshest in the world.  If they liked a restaurant-the food was good,-but it wasn't their favorite, they will go ahead and give the restaurant a 1-star. If they really liked the restaurant and it's their top 10 favorite restaurant in Vegas, they will give it about 2 stars. They have no real structure on giving out 5-star ratings and will just randomly give out a rare 5-star if they are in a really good mood. That's why when you click on their yelp profiles, they have like 20-30 1-star ratings and like one or three 5-Star ratings. Also, check the reviews for every business located on the ""Cheyenne Strip"". Every business on this part of Cheyenne has an average of a 2 star overall rating. Are these ratings justified? Absolutely not! The residents in this area are those certain types of customers that are very difficult and impossible to satisfy. 

The Sushi here is not bad at all. And the prices are the best in town. Where else in Las Vegas can you get a $15.00 AYCE sushi deal? For some reason, TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE reminded me of one of these places but without the conveyer belt.  

There are two Sushi houses in this area. The first being ""Sushi Bomb"" and the 2nd being TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE. A lot of people in the NW area compare this place to ""Sushi bomb"" and I think that's why many reviews are too critical. I actually decided to come here because ""Sushi Bomb"" gets extremely crowded during dinner hours, and like a lot of yelpers complain about, the wait time to get seated over there gets extremely long some nights. Sure, this place isn't a popular hangout for young people and pro-poker players like ""Sushi Bomb"" is, but at least it's half the price, you get seated immediately, and you get good tasting fish. Today, I was not in the mood for maki and wanted some good nigri. TSH, has a perfect selection of all nigri. They got everything from Albacore to Unagi, and the sushi chef sends it out fast. Also, the fish here at TSH is good-fresh seafood. There is nothing wrong with it like many NW yelpers claim. Many people try to compare the freshness to ""Sushi Bomb"" who actually kills some of  the fish the same day they serve it, but that's why that place is over $30.00 per person, and this place is only $15.00.  

If you follow my reviews, you already know that I am very critical of how uncultured  people are who live in NW Las Vegas. Before I came here, I already knew that a lot of the bad reviews about ""rude service"" was just their cultural ignorance. The servers here don't have much English, and have difficulties understanding someone who is speaking really fast. So, she is not ""stupid"" or ""being rude"" if she gives you an incorrect answer to your question. BTW, the service to me was very good. There was never a moment that lasted more than a minute where my drink wasn't being refilled. 

I guess another plus about this place is that the Sushi Chef is very quiet and traditional. If you have mature older family members or young children, this place might be the best choice. At ""Sushi bomb"", some of the chefs are young and quite popular with the ladies, so you might hear him bragging about how he banged some chick the other night. In conclusion, TOKYO is definitely has a better atmosphere for families with young children.

Most of the Sushi houses on the West Coast were originally established by Japanese nationals(not Japanese-Americans), and quickly sold to Korean-Americans. I don't understand why they always do this? Is this some kind of common investment by business men in Japan? I tried asking my Dad, my lawyer, and one of my best friends who are all Japanese-American, but because they were all born in Hawaii, they had no clue about why investors in Japan do this. Anyone know?

So practically, I would say this is a good 4-star establishment, but I will give it 5-stars just to compensate for all the unjust 1-star ratings",Restaurant
GFqrBkms2d2OSXkLLG92wg,UIdROvjyMfhoKhJ-Giuxpw,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2016-11-28,"So here's my review.

When we first give our car to the valet guy the bell boy helps us with our bags and the last thing he says to me is that I won't be seeing him from this point on and that another bell boy will be taking my bags and with a awkward pause I realize he wants me to tip him immediately. I could tell this is beginning of a bad stay especially since I've stayed at nice places and I know when to tip. It's thanksgiving I get it...

On first arrival of the room there were already numerous large stains on the floor which I feel like they could hit it again with a rug doctor. It wasn't something you wanna see in the middle of the floor when you walk in and out of the room. Already I had the feeling that the floor wasn't that clean. 

Second the bedroom night light didn't work. So either you had to have the entire large room lights on or nothing on by the bed. This sounds like I'm being picky but the entire light and mount on the bed frame was wobbly and falling apart. When they said they would fix it, it would take them an hour possibly. 

The TV was lose at it's hinges and nearly fell off as my wife put stuff in the cabinets below it. I called management and they sent a repair man up who confirmed that they were installing new hinges and the previous team didn't tighten them properly. 

Lastly we have a suite. It comes with a kitchen. I would like to cook. As I call for some utensils the night of to cook it's about 8:00. They ask me how many people will be dining in and thats it. I get a ring at 8:30 and they than give me 2 setting of plates with forks and knive setting and a rather large plastic past spoon to cook with. That's it........ I don't know about you guys but when you cook you need more than just a plastic spoon to cook with. I needed at least some tongs to flip over the steaks. So I call again and request some tongs and some bowls. an hour passes and nobody I call and they said they'd send somebody up right away. 30min passes no body I call the front desk and make a complaint and he is even surprised telling me there is a long line of requests waiting over and hour. Long story short he's on it. 20min later my dinner is ruined.... It's 10pm I decided to cook the steaks without their help. I grabbed the ice tongs from the ice bucket and got it to work. The kitchen btw has like 6 different cabinets with absolutely nothing in them. I feel like I'm at a open house with everything removed...The fridge is not even cold because it's frozen completely so I'm thawing it out.....

Parking is notorious here btw because there is no self parking you gotta pay 18$ a day to valet it takes about 30min to get your car. 

So as I check out I tell the lady how our stay was. We had stayed for 3nights spent prob over 700$ including their daily resort fees. I tell her I'm not trying to be a prick and nicely tell her on. She shows some type of regret for what had happened but brushed it aside and said she'd refund me 2 resort day fees which is like $70 but still charge me for another day and the valet parking and my room service. In all honesty the hotel didn't feel that awesome the staff was alright and I hate to admit this but Trump hotel still ranks better in my book. I've paid less at Trump and got a much better response from the staff. I'm not asking for freebies but when I've already paid for a lot and your response is to the point of hey we'll comp your sodas it's more of a slap in the face than comping me nothing to be honest. Show me you care and believe me . It takes only a second for that. If you know I didn't have a great stay and had to stay in my room numerous times to deal with bullshit that is supposed to be fixed before I get there or make me wait very long times.. Get your manager and show me your gonna try to make this better for the next guess. Your default save cannot be I'll take off the resort fee. That's already a bullshit fee that all the hotels tag on now to make more money. I know some people won't have the same experience that I do and that's because maybe the system wasn't tested at the time but let me tell you when it rains at Vdara it pours.",Beauty
3a2phZJdo-_0tjjZF-Oqmw,Ry4Qxi__pgkvL2Dqdlolww,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2015-03-27,"The Experience:
I was looking for a pet friendly hotel for a mini vacation with my puppy brother. I decided to go on the off days and check in on a Sunday afternoon and check out on a Tuesday (to avoid the drunken crowds on the weekends). There is a dog park and a memorial park found after you cross the valet lines. They provide free valet parking service which is kinda nice and definitely makes you feel special. Walking into Vdara you can clearly notice that there is no casino or smoke from people's cigarettes. I honestly loved that! I loved not walking in and smelling a whole lot of crap. There is also one bar and a starbucks. The location of Vdara itself isn't too shabby. You are able to go to Cosmo with just a few steps, it's in the City Center so it's definitely very close to every thing. I did see the cleaning cart in our hallway all 3 days that we were there. Not sure if maybe it was forgotten or what but it was just so weird and random to see it there. Also, on one of the nights we were there, I ordered room service for myself while I was taking a hot bath and the person that delivered literally just walked into my room, while dog was loose (being that I was in the room with him). It was a weird experience. So glad that my husband was there to go take care of it and ensure that Porky didn't get out. I would have preferred for room service to knock first and if no answer, come back after a few minutes or something, don't just walk in, especially when you have a dog staying in the room. As far as cost goes for what you get, not too bad. Totally worth it.


The Room:
Huge! Modern and very spacious suite. I loved the huge window we had in our room (our view wasn't the greatest.. we saw the highway but no biggie). It was a bit of a pain to get out of bed to close the blinds (yea, I'm lazy.. don't judge me.. it is called vacation!). The room had enough space for Porky to even run around. It had a comfy couch by the window. There is a kitchen area with a stove and a sink that is found in the entrance of the suite. You can call the front desk for kitchen ware for what I understand. There is also a small fridge and two free water bottles are provided for you every day. There is a big bathroom with a soak tub and a standing shower. One sink with a decent amount of space for all my crap. WiFi was ok. Tv is alright too. The tv is in a weird location of the room being that if I lay down in bed, it is not in front center of me. 

Dog friendliness:
I honestly loved that it was dog friendly. Dogs up to 70 pounds or two dogs with the combined weight of 70 pounds are welcome to stay at Vdara. There is an additional fee of $50 per night plus an additional $75 one time only cleaning fee that is not refundable. When you check in, the make you sign a waiver and let you know the rules. They provide your dog a small goody bag with a blanket, a dog treat and a dog menu. Being that it's a dog friendly casino, there will be times that dogs will bark during your stay. I was ok with it but I know my pup had a few moments of ""wtf? what was that?"" Nothing drastic though. I had the chance to order room service for Porkchop since provide a dog menu. Sure why not, right? He gobbled that up in no time too. Must have been good. There is a dog park with dog poop bags, a bench and a water fountain. Unfortunately you gotta cross the valet line to get to it. That would be one reason to deduct a star. No dog bowls available unless you call the front desk. 

Dog room service menu:
Fetch of the day- Seared filet with sweet potatoes. green beans and yellow squash (S: $10 M: $12)

Chicken a la coop- Hormone free baked chicken with whole grain brown rice
(S: $7 M: $14)

Rollover- Chicken and beef sauteed with fresh vegetables and orzo pasta
(S: $8 M: $15)

Casino and Parking Lot: NO casino. Valet parking only and it's super tricky to find.


Customer service: 8\/10
Pet Stay Deluxe Suite: 9\/10
Decorations around the hotel: very modern and artsy! 10\/10
Casino: NO casino (or smoking or parking structure in this hotel)
Over all: 9\/10


Wouldn't mind coming back and staying here again, since I can bring my fur baby with me and be in a clean and comfortable room. I would recommend looking around for damage in the room prior getting comfy just to ensure that there is no prior dog damage that you would be held accountable for.",Beauty
W4d4eF5y9f9dbQWEosAMmQ,4qguccLSZEsypfPIsRbEaw,Yv7uZYJ5HJayw7kcxLq_xw,2014-11-18,"I went to Pink Nails on Farm in the Centennial Hills area in the late morning of 1 November 2014. I've been to plenty of salons in the past (yes, nail salons that also offer other services) but was never assaulted by the disgusting and overwhelming chemical smell that was present at Pink Nails. Pink must have no ventilation system other than what is typically in a regular retail shop or their specialized ventilation system must not function well. I admit that I am not an expert as to the specifications recommended for salon ventilation but I would think that they should have something beyond normal HVAC. No matter what, the smell was overpowering and went far beyond typical nail salon smells. I don't know exactly what the deal is over there but the place smells terrible. I get that there is a variety of chemical substances used in these places but something should be done to minimize their intrusion into the environment. Some workers use face masks but there is nothing to protect customers. While I understand that workers are exposed to the odors for a greater duration of time than are customers, customer wellbeing must also be considered.

There were problems beyond the smells, though. Even though there were plenty of customers in the salon, there were several workers in the front doing absolutely nothing. Despite the fact that these women were unoccupied, it took just shy of ten minutes before I was even acknowledged. Also, while filling out my line of the sign in sheet, I noticed that they ask for customers to state whether or not they have an active Yelp account. I am sure that they are not the only place that asks this but I have never been to an establishment that inquires into this area. Perhaps the owners\/managers should be concerned about providing top-notch customer service to all who enter their shop instead of fretting about who may comment on their experiences via Yelp. While waiting for my turn, I glanced around the salon and saw how cluttered it was. There were boxes of products, piles of towels, various supplies, papers and to-go containers everywhere (clearly because of workers and not customers). The space is packed with as many work stations as possible as well. I totally understand the desire to maximize profits but I would rather see a business try to provide a positive and comfortable atmosphere as well as wonderful customer service to its patrons rather than try to cram as many people as possible into their shop and get through tons of services throughout the day. There was also a man pacing around the shop (he may have been the owner or manager) leaning over the customers and workers like a creepy lurker. It was quite off-putting. Keeping an eye on your establishment is great but there are better ways to go about it. On top of that, there were plenty of tasks with which he could assist (such as cleaning, organizing, helping customers not being assisted, etc...). 

When I was finally called back, I was not greeted at all. My name was called by a woman who was preoccupied with fiddling with something in her hand and not looking at anyone. I was brought to a back room (which is the size of a small walk-in closet at best and has a door to match) for my service (a brow clean-up, something I don't do with frequency but just felt like getting done). I had to dodge piles of towels and opened boxes to get through the narrow path to that service room. Once the worker pulled back the door, I immediately saw that the clutter, to-go containers, coffee cups and lack of organization plaguing the rest of the shop also has a hold over the service room area. The instruments and work surfaces were all clean but the environment is quite uncomfortable. Though clean, the wax warmer had drips and pools of wax hardened all over it and those issues appeared to be present for a while (as in not from that day). Once the service started, the woman who was performing it did not say a word to me. I'm not the type that likes a lot of chatting during services but this was bizarre and seemed quite unfriendly. She picked up her phone a couple of times and even walked away for two minutes having not said a word about leaving. A minute or so after she came back, another worker came in, made a rude comment to her and left. A few minutes later, my service was over and I went to the front to pay. The same woman who performed my service rang me up. She tried to build a tip into the amount she charged me without saying anything. I didn't let that stand and told her that I would be paying the amount listed in their service chart. I respectfully but firmly told her that this behavior is not acceptable. After all of that, I handed her my $20 and waited for my change. She shoved my change at me, rolled her eyes and stomped away. 

People have bad days and sometimes poorly performing employees can taint someone's view of a business. However, the problems here are bigger than one person's actions. I cannot recommend Pink Nails.",Beauty
DQ2HKVBp7vC169cKcg5Zsw,tIVXSfOzelq6Tm4rwd2mAw,z8XIldYr65CKOz8yOI5R8A,2017-03-21,"My wife & I stayed here for 5 days & 4 nights to celebrate our 15th Wedding Anniversary this past week. 

Upon check-in, we were given a coupon book for the hotel and casino which was a nice gesture that helped offset the very affordable nightly Resort Fee of $18.99. The Resort Fee also provided free valet parking and proved to be very convenient when considering how far the self-parking area was from the Spa Tower (where our room was).

The rooms are well appointed and very spacious; quite possibly the biggest (non-suit) hotel room I've ever seen. The bathroom was spacious and provided a spa like experience with both a large Jacuzzi tub and separate stand up shower with dual shower heads. We were quite impressed... The bed was a little firm for our taste, I woke up a few times with a sore hip and back (I'm only 35). We're from California, so our sensitivity to cigarette smoke is high; smoking indoors is very foreign to us and we have to mentally shift our expectations when in Vegas. But, thankfully, in this hotel the only area we noticed smoking was in the casino, which was to be expected. We were thankful that smoke was a non-issue in the rooms and other areas of the hotel.

The hotel grounds were absolutely beautiful, with several waterfalls scattered throughout the property. The sound of the water was very soothing and provided a very relaxing environment to unwind. There was even a waterfall in the pool which was a neat addition for kids and adults alike. The pool appeared to be clean for the most part with exception to a few areas where someone tracked\/smeared a good amount of geese feces right near the edge of the pool. The property had several large geese that roamed the area, while they're beautiful to look at, they do leave pretty large droppings behind. I was disappointed to see that despite many pool\/cafe staff walking by it they paid no attention, and with several kids around, it could have easily been transferred into the pool water.

Our stay here was NEAR perfect, until...we encountered a hiccup with the poolside cafe staff. After 25 minutes of waiting and watching for servers, I decided to go order at the counter. Prices were high, which is somewhat to be expected. I ordered a salad ($19), a BLT sandwich and 2 'virgin' Pina Coladas, my bill came out to ~$53. The cashier asked where I was sitting and gave me a bright orange number to place on my table. I headed back to my seat and another 20-25 minutes rolled by... At this point I start wondering where our food is. The cafe was a pretty good distance from where we were, but I had a clear visual of the counter. Finally I see one of the servers with a tray walking on the other side of the pool asking people if he had their order...I catch eye contact with him and show him my orange ticket but he pretended not to see me and kept walking. I thought maybe he saw me and was going to walk around the pool to deliver our food, but to our dismay, I noticed he sat the tray down on the bar counter and begin to do something else. I thought surely he's gonna circle again in a few minutes, but we had no such luck. I sat and watched for about 10 minutes as server after server passed by my food with no concern or regard. I finally got up and walked over there and asked the server if that was my food and if he saw me waive at him, he confirmed it was my food and stumbled over his response to my question. His response, ""you must have moved..."", I replied and let him know that we never moved and that I did see him catch eye contact me with; he never denied seeing me. As you can imagine, I was pretty annoyed that we had paid $53 for cold pool food, and then the lack of decent customer service, to boot.

Other than this, our overall experience was good and we enjoyed a restful stay.",Beauty
Rkm82Dn2zFtdDfVV3ttr4w,j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,f12Zv1B9crmSW58iyTR_mA,2015-06-01,"Midwood Smokehouse opened its second location on May 7, 2015 in the Ballantyne neighborhood of Charlotte. It's in the old Sticky Fingers Smokehouse space at Toringdon Circle (shopping center). I visited this restaurant a couple weeks after it opened with a group of friends, two of whom make up two-thirds of the Barbecue Bros (http:\/\/barbecuebros.co\/). We ordered a nice sampling of BBQ and enjoyed the experience. The food and service were good.

At 5:45pm on a Friday, the restaurant was already very busy. We were told by the hostess that our wait would be about 30 minutes. We were seated in about 20. There wasn't much space at the bar so we waited outside with others. By the time we left around 7:15pm, the number of folks waiting had grown quite large. There must've been at least a half-dozen groups\/families waiting.

The inside of the restaurant resembles an American restaurant chain such as Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. The clean, open space features both a bar and dining room with a mixture of booths and tables. Our group of six sat in one of the circular bench-style booths by the windows. The interior sports several large TVs (great for watching sports), vintage North Carolina artwork and memorabilia, and artistic metal cutouts with a BBQ, farm, and kitchen theme.

I haven't been to Midwood Smokehouse's original location in Plaza Midwood, but I was told by my tablemates that that location is different in look and feel. This location in Ballantyne is designed for the suburbs. There's plenty of parking too.

The BBQ served here is influenced from various styles from the Carolinas to Texas. Aside from the standard sandwiches and plates, Midwood Smokehouse also serves salads, tacos, and appetizers like Pimento Cheese Fries, Fried Pickles, and Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos. Expect to spend about $8-10 each for most sandwiches (includes a side) and about $10-18 each for most plates. Plates come in both small and large sizes.

We went with the following:

BBQ:
* Burnt Ends (small, $13.50) - crispy caramelized cubes of brisket tossed in a housemade Fat Tire BBQ sauce
* Combo Platter (""Well-Fed,"" $22), which came with:
* Carolina Chopped Pork - hickory-smoked chopped pork lightly dressed in Eastern NC vinegar sauce
* Beef Brisket (both fatty and lean) - Texas-style sliced beef brisket served in natural juices
* Smoked Sausage - combination of beef, pork, and garlic
* Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs (dry) - smoked

Apps & Sides:
* Hushpuppies (whole basket, $5) - scratch-made, slightly sweet and warm, served with BBQ sauce
* Collard Greens
* Classic Mac & Cheese
* BBQ Slaw

I liked everything. The food had simple presentation and was served in old-fashioned plates and bowls with floral decorations akin to something you'd expect to find at your grandma's house.

The Burnt Ends were rather tender and flavorful. They were more tender than I was expecting. A good bit of sauce, flavor (sweetness), and caramelization. These were probably my favorite of the BBQ meats. The Carolina Chopped Pork was on par with other chopped pork I've had around the state. Moist and tasty, the meat was smoked with hickory logs from North Carolina.

You have the option of ordering the Beef Brisket fatty, lean, or both. We got both and the brisket was delectable. Smoky with an appetizing chew and consistency. The Smoked Sausage was A-OK. Plump and glistening, it was charred on one side and had firm texture and bite. The Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs were excellent. Near ""fall off the bone,"" the somewhat fatty meat and rub were packed with delicious flavor. Note the ribs are available with sauce as well.

BBQ sauces at the table included South Carolina Mustard, Eastern NC Vinegar, Midwood Signature, and Habanero. My favorite was the subtly sweet Midwood Signature, but really, none of the BBQ needed any sauce. The meats tasted fine without it.

The Hushpuppies were small and soft, almost squishy. They weren't crispy nor crunchy, but had comparatively smooth centers. The Collards, with bits of pork, were alright as was the BBQ Slaw. When it comes to slaw, you can order both mayo-based ""Coleslaw"" or the NC traditional vinegar-based ""BBQ Slaw"" (a.k.a. red slaw), finely chopped. The Mac & Cheese was great. Made with elbow macaroni, it was nice and cheesy with small, chewy bits of hardened, charred cheese. It was moderately oily, but lots of good mac 'n cheese are greasy.

Service was terrific. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time and I was impressed with how our server remembered our food and drink orders after we'd changed our minds and switched them up on her. Kudos. Founder\/owner Frank Scibelli personally checked on our table. Midwood Smokehouse plans to open more locations including one in Columbia, SC.

I was attracted to the fact that they include a lot of free classes & all the yoga you could want, it is big enough to have your own space and it has a Kidszone.

Pros:  

1. As far as I can tell, I have always been able to get on equipment that I want. I normally don't go at peak hours so I can't tell you if this is true all the time

2. Locker room seems clean, has two saunas and a steam room if you are into that. Plenty of lockers between the two in the building.

3. Doesn't have a smelly gym smell to the workout area or locker room. 

4. Easy to get into classes if you plan just slightly ahead. Some classes are more popular than others. Over all very good yoga instructors. 

Cons:

1. Kidszone is a complete joke!

They either need to embrace the concept or give it up. Right now, it's a poor excuse for a place to take your kids while you work out. It would seem like the person who is responsible for managing the Kidszone isn't a parent or forgets what it was like to have little kids....

The kids play area is lacking any real activities. I have a 5 & 3 yr old and they absolutely hate going there. They say it is boring and I can't blame them. There are a few mats to play on and not much more. There needs to be something more to play with... ie: TOYS! You know, those things kids love to play with... They don't have to be fancy... a few books, some blocks, a few cars and trucks, maybe a small dramatic play area.....  It doesn't take much to keep a kid busy for an hour but they really need more than a few gym mats.

Also, they won't change diapers or help older children use the restroom... What?? If you are going to have a kidzone, it comes with the territory.... Diapers, maybe but little kids & bathroom, you need to help them if they're toilet trained. The restrooms are not equipped for little kids so it would be hard for a little kid to get up on the toilet. Also, anyone who has little kids know that they may have to go 20 mins after they just went...  If you won't change diapers, you need to have a bathroom equipped to change diapers... diaper changing table would help! 

Non-engaging kidszone employees. Being so close to Univ of WI, you would think Capitol Fitness would have access to a ton of early childcare majors or even early education students who would like to have a chance and work at a place to gain some real work experience.   At least from the the few times I was there, there was no real engagement happening between the employee and the kids.   It's like my neighbor's kids are watching my kids. 

On the flip side, if Capitol Fitness is just doing the kidszone so they can say they have one but don't really want to have kids actually in the gym, then they are very successful.  

2. Parking is definitely a hassle during the week if you want to be close. If you don't want to pay for parking, go after 6:00 pm when the meters stop or park a few blocks away in the neighborhood.

3. The interior of the gym is definitely looking somewhat dated. It's dark and dim. The atmosphere is sort of muted and not very motivating. The gym is starting to show it's age.

4. Not a lot of sanitize wipes  \/ hand sanitizer around which is why I see people skipping off the equipment without cleaning it.   I've been in gyms where they are all over the place so it unavoidable not to clean the equipment after you are done.

5. Towels. I know people already talked about this. I will say that they do have a ton of hand towels and a limited number of small gym towels available to use without charge.  If you need to take a shower but forget to bring your own, you could make due with two smaller gym towel. 

Overall, the gym is about average and you get what you pay for ($44 mth). My old gym in DC was twice the cost but provided twice the service.  So for this price range and if you exclude the consideration of a kidzone, I would say the gym is average. There are better gyms in the Madison which are probably a better value compared to service but, you have to drive out in suburbs to go there... if you live anywhere near west, near east or downtown, this is probably your only choice for a full service fitness center. Until Capitol Fitness has a full service gym close by as it's competitive, we probably won't see much change.   

The Bright Side!
There are a lot of new big buildings going up in the next few years on the E. Washington Ave corridor so it will be just a matter of time until we'll see so other gym move into the area... It's up to Capitol Fitness Management to see if they can stay ahead and keep the gym relevant before people leave for something better...",Beauty

Personally, I remember when Atria's was a hole-in-the-wall place on the Dormont\/Mt. Lebanon border where you went to pick up a six pack of yellow beer, but over time, that original location turned into an upscale sit-down restaurant with excellent food.

Well this NEW Atria's location did not disappoint!  Our party of six was greeted nicely and seated promptly in the glass-enclosed front room.  The location of our big round table was a little awkward for the wait staff (they really couldn't get to a third of our party, and things had to be passed to them) but the seats were comfortable, and the wicker\/rattan table with the glass top was handsome.  I don't usually notice things like place mats, but I really liked how these ones complimented the table nicely.  The youngest folks in our party were impressed with the decor of the place.  The room we were seated in turned out to be a little on the noisy side, because three sides of it had very reflective glass walls.  We remarked that a room with that much glass should have some plants or some attempt at sound dampening, but ownership went with a very clean and modern look.

We were served by Sarah, a lovely young lady who appreciated a large table on a slow Sunday night and who seemed very sincere about making our first visit a good one.  She succeeded, and I would ask for her specifically upon my return.  Sarah had good support from other staff members who assisted her, and we even received a visit from the executive chef, who mentioned that he'd only been out of the kitchen five times the whole day.  He was funny, and when our friend asked him if the fresh salmon being served that evening ""had a name,"" he responded, ""Tom Brady.""

The first thing we noticed was a rather limited tap selection.  Guinness was available, but we opted for Southern Tier 2X IPA, thankful that there was at least one really good beer on hand.  Why upscale restaurants waste their taps on multiple ""light"" beers is a mystery to me.  The first thing that came out of the kitchen were our soups.  The tortilla soup was richly seasoned, thick, and excellent.  The sherry crab bisque must have been really good too, based on our friend's ""mmmmmm"" sounds.

I was intrigued by the ""winter warmer"" selections on the top of the menu, and so I opted for the ""char-grilled meatloaf stack.""  It was excellent.  The meatloaf slices were grilled to perfection so every inch had a nice crunch on the outside with nice moisture on the inside.  The barbecue sauce was sweet and unique.  My dining partner immediately helped herself to some of the jalapeno cornbread on the bottom of the stack. It was firm, but moist and delicious, with just the right amount of sweetness.  The smashed redskin potatoes with onion straws topped off the stack, and their flavor was just what I had hoped for.  This was a wonderfully conceived and executed dish, and I even took a picture of it.  (I will attempt to re-create this one at home, giving all credit to Justin, the chef at Atria's.)

Fortunately for me, my dining partner followed my friend's lead an ordered a dish with a fresh salmon steak.  She got the flame-grilled salmon salad.  Not only was it a very nice salad with a very interesting poppyseed dressing, it came with a nicely-sized and perfectly grilled piece of very lightly smoked salmon.  It was so tender and moist, with just a little bit rare in the middle, the way salmon is supposed to be done.  Kudos to the kitchen for not overcooking ""Tom Brady.""  

Around the rest of the table, everyone was all smiles.  One of our party ordered the petite filet with crab cakes.  She said her filet was the best she'd had, and the color in the middle was just right for medium rare.  The crab cake was a good size, and she ended up saving most of it for later.  I wish I had gotten a taste, because she raved about it and a good crab cake makes me smile too!  Her partner got an interesting pasta dish called ""fra diablo,"" with sausage, chicken and banana peppers.  He likes the spicy things in life, and he was quite impressed with this dish.  My foodie friend has a miso-glazed salmon, and he thought it was among the best-prepared pieces he had ever tasted.

I am looking foward to returning to Atria's soon, as there were several menu items that intrigued me, and I thought the prices were moderate for food this good.  Maybe I'll even try the hand-breaded cod sandwiches in honor of the old Brass Rail, which had my favorite fish sandwich in the area.",Restaurant

I'm not much of a breakfast\/brunch person b\/c I can't handle anything heavy in the morning. However, my friend was enticed by their signature ""Milk and Cookies Soufflé"" and wanted to dine there. 

After looking through the online menu myself, I was sold on the Kobe burger. What carnivore can ever turn down a good burger? Certainly NOT me...so we decided to come to Tableau for a late brunch during our Vegas trip.

Tableau is inconspicuously located in the Tower Suites of The Wynn where you have to walk through the casino and pass the High Roller area before you see a sign for it. If you're not familiar w\/ the layout of the casino, it can be confusing, so make sure to ask one of the employees lingering in the area for directions. 

My friend and I promptly arrived for our 1 PM reservations on Saturday, 7.31.10 and were seated at a table overlooking the pool area. 

FOOD\/DRINKS:
*Fresh Watermelon Juice ($6): Refreshingly light and sweet.  

*Kobe Burger w\/ Old Bay Fries ($16): OMG--SO GOOD! The thick Kobe patty was perfectly grilled to a medium w\/ a soft pink center topped w\/ an ooey goeey melted aged cheddar, nestled against fresh ripen beef steak tomato slices, butter lettuce, pickles, crisp red onions and then sandwiched between a toasted homemade sesame bun. 

As I bit into the burger, I got a slight crisp from the toasted bun and veggies before my teeth sunk into the tender patty, which was so moist, that juices started to dribble down the bread and onto my plate. Since the bread was toasted on both sides, it held everything together in place just fine. The burger had the perfect combo of crispiness from the bread and lettuce, tender savoryness from the kobe, saltiness from the cheddar, and a slight tang from the pickles.

The fries were perfectly crisp and the old bay seasoning added a kick from red and black peppers, cloves, and all spice. The homemade ketchup was the perfect accompaniment; you can really taste the fresh tangy sweetness from the vine ripen tomatoes which added a zing to the burger and fries. 

*Milk & Cookies Soufflé ($10): It was ok and was nothing to write home about. I prefer my soufflé light and fluffy, and Tableu's soufflé was on little on the heavy and dry side. The vanilla ice cream was rich and smooth, and the chocolate sauce was thick and decadent. It was a great contrast of temperatures and textures, but again, I wasn't keen on the soufflé's dryness. 

SERVICE:
Our server was pretentious and not friendly. He never cracked a smile the entire a time and was pretty much gone after he took our order. He was only there to give us our dessert and our bill (after having to ask a busboy). I had to ask for my water to be refilled, which is pretty much a no-no at a more upscale dining establishment.

AMBIANCE\/DÉCOR:
Classy; crisp white linen tables, a gold chandelier, and tan curtains draped against large windows overseeing the pool area. Tables are well spaced out to allow for a more intimate dining w\/ your party and for ease of conversation. 

If you're looking for a nice, serene place for breakfast\/brunch after a night of heavy drinking and debauchery, Tableau is the perfect place...",Restaurant

My wife loves this place, and I can see why. The decor is as if the hobby lobby filled head of a molly Mormon exploded inside a hole in a wall restaurant, and the resulting mess that came out was cookies and vinyl lettering surrounded by oil paintings of merchant allies in Paris. If you're into that sort of thing, be my guest. Otherwise, the paint jobs look unprofessional (clearly no primer and sloppy lines), the design is inconsistent and the sitting bars by the windows are literally plank boards being held together by vice grips. As hard as they try to design the hell out of this place they did so by cutting corners, and it shows. Very sloppy. 

That brings me to another point, in what appears to be another effort to pinch every penny, sweet cakes has made a very critical anti-consumer mistake and is now only accepting cash. They say they're ""going green"" which is bull. Getting rid of a credit card machine doesn't do anything to support sustainability, but it sure is a nice way to get people to think you're not actually screwing them when they walk inside.  All's not lost though (sarcasm), seeing as how they only accept cash now, they've conveniently provided an ATM in their shop that you can withdraw cash from, and wouldn't you know it, it's owned by sweet cakes cafe (gee, I wonder who gets a cut of that $2 atm service fee for pulling out cash, nevermind the $2 your bank will charge you in addition to the atm). It would be one thing if the owners passed on the ""burden"" of accepting debit and credit cards to the consumer by slightly raising prices (heaven forbid!), but it's a whole different thing to profit from the fact that the consumer has no choice other than cash in your establishment. 

I didn't try the deli items here, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. The pizza literally looked like the kind you would get from a school cafeteria lunch and the sandwiches didn't look particularly appetizing either. We did try the cookies and I have to say that I was really disappointed. They were too crunchy and hard. The snicker doodle was actually decent, but for the most part I could make better cookies than these at home. The only difference here is that they must use an ice cream scoop when baking them because they're so huge. Speaking of which, if you go on Saturday they have a ""buy 2 cookies get 1 free"" sale, and I put that in quotes, because the reality of the situation is that if you buy 4 cookies, you will not get 2 additional free. I wanted to buy 4 cookies and get 2 free because in my mind, when you say buy 2 get 1 free, unless there's a limit stated then it should extend to multiples of two, it's just common sense. But when confronted about it, the cashier claimed that it's buy 2 or more and get 1 free. That's a huge difference!! If the policy is 1 free cookie per transaction then it should be clearly stated on the sign, instead, yet again sweet cakes has shown their anti-consumer attitude by their unclear and misleading sale. 

Overall, if I'm going to spend $7 on a sandwich, or $1.5 on a cookie, i'm going to do it at paradise bakery or somewhere that I don't feel like they're trying to rip me off by selling me sub par goods at higher prices. I'm all for supporting your local businesses, but when you can visit a shop once and determine that you don't even want to give it a second chance, you've messed up.",Restaurant

A lot of stereotypes come into mind when you walk into this place: Crunchy vibe. Deep Forest-ish music. At least one thing from India on the wall. Words like ""vegan"" and ""elixir"" floating around. That said, being where I'm from, I'm used to all this stuff. Except here at Mandala there is no overpowering patchouli smell. Nor roaches tittering about. Success!

We sat in the corner of the room, leaning back on throw pillows at a low table. Our friendly and warmly welcoming server, who was glowing with health and good cheer probably because she hasn't eaten anything deep fried in a decade, presented us with menus. 

I chose a Rooibos Chai (no caffeine).

""I'm sorry. We're out.""

I then chose another normal-ish tea with no caffeine.

""I'm sorry. We're also out of that one."" 

So apparently Mandala has 54 teas and I'm having a good knack of picking out the 4 they don't have in stock. Which was briefly disconcerting. I'm a chai and kawa (green tea) drinker by birth and all this fruity tea business that was left to choose from wasn't all that appealing to me, but I had no choice and ended up going with one. 

It arrived in a French press, and then I noticed a whole bunch were also on sale on a shelf next to me for $30 (talk about clever cross-marketing and insane profit margins - maybe Mandala's not so Berkeley after all). And after a few drops of organic agave nectar, the tea tasted pretty good, I'll admit.

We also got dessert, which I was initially skeptical about. I got the vegan coconut cake because that meant no worries on the drive home. Esteemed dining companion had raw berry pie, which actually felt and tasted like a gelatinous smoothie. Which sounds pretty nasty, but it was really damn good. Believe me. And so was my cake, surprisingly enough (tasty, not nasty). Now, I'm not turning vegan anytime soon, but I can certainly appreciate when vegan's done well. 

We then relaxed amongst the pillows and hung out for a long while, waxing about life's possibilities while drunkards walked past outside, trying to find Devil's Martini. Ah, the poor souls. Trying to find their nirvana in a pair of fake mamms and the ragas of Usher and T-Pain. But more power to them...

Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah. I noticed that Mandala has free WiFi, which is a  bonus for folks who want to work in a quieter environment. However, the place closes at 9 most nights, which for the laptop WiFi crowd is basically 3 in the afternoon. That, not so great.

But in the end, as a place so close to some of the most obnoxious places in Scottsdale, I'm amazed Mandala's managed to remain as it is for so long. Definitely recommended for those who like tea (except apparently the teas I want) and a chilled out atmosphere smack in the middle of old town Scottsdale. I don't see myself coming here all too often, because something about spending $5 on hot water with leaves is a little hard for me to reconcile, but Mandala is still quality product.

I Q AIPs alignment 2 industry Best Practices & Aveda standards. I would've never trusted a student, but I sure trusted the wrong EDUCATOR. Their Aveda Certified Educator, Color Specialist, 2014 Inspire Greatness Aveda Institute Champion combo cosmetology TEAM LEAD (TL) did not follow verbal or written instructions that I provided her & the student (S). Plus, she formulated unorthodox chemicals for someone w\/ my coloring. Even AVEDA CORP said she should've known better.

Adjust the contrast\/brightness of your monitor N order 2 C the true colors of my pix. As per AIP, the .pdf\/evidence of my instructions keeps being deleted from YELP.

I said 2x to ea & wrote once ""Apply color to new growth only."" They put color 4.5"" past my 1\/2"" of new growth. I said I wanted to go 1- 2 shades lighter than my standard Aveda formula I have used for 6 years: 30 vol 60g of Deep 10N @ 45 mins. The written instructions also said, ""Do not use foils, pull through, or use a gloss."" This formula & method provided me with an earthy honey blond. B\/c I wore my hair in the same braid @ all my outdoorsy jobs, my hair looked like multi-toned whipped honey peppered w\/ sparkly platinum streaks.

TL formulated: 40 vol 60g of Deep 12N @ 45 min w\/ shower cap.

My crown turned POLAR BEAR WHITE. In response, TL, who teaches blonding classes, said, ""I didn't expect this to be so light. Sometimes this happens. Blondes are hard."" Then TL said she'd fix it.

TL formulated: 40g 0N + 40g 10N + 1g  Lite Yellow Orange + 40mL of CTA.

Unfortunately, TL & S coated all my hair--not just the white part. TL tried to dilute the mistake-not fix it. This wasn't very prudent. FINAL RESULT: my crown was monochromatic yet streaky ELECTRIC BUTTER YELLOW & the rest of my normally glossy multi-d sun-kissed honey blond hair was DULL, DRY shades of homogeneous STRAW YELLOW w\/ PUMPKIN ORANGE tones. My entire head was a color mullet in shades of Crayola Crayons. And this was the ""fixed"" version.

When I got really upset, an older blond mgr told me to come back in 2-3 days after my hair calmed down for a FREE color correction. At 1st, I accepted. I had been there for 5 hours & was exhausted, hungry, & so very much wanted it to be fixable. But, after all my research, I realized how egregious the mistakes were & wasn't going to subject myself to a 2nd multi-mistake incident.  There was no way my hair or I could handle a 3rd trauma. She's THE BEST of THE BEST--and this is what happened??? I stopped my cc payment the following week, and the Institute did not contest it.

I learned, much later, from Aveda Educators around the country, Color Specialists in the valley, & Aveda Corp, 40 vol is used on people with black\/choco, coarse, & thick hair who want 2 go platinum or Crayola-colored. (I have naturally dark-blond, fine hair; fair, yellow-toned skin; and dark green eyes. How could she not notice this?) She used one of the lightest possible Lift-Color-Methods: 40vol\/Deep 12N\/Shower cap.

1-2 shades lighter is literally changing only Deep 10N to Deep 11N or 12N--not changing the volume, especially together with color, and most especially w\/n the Deep line. Deep already has extra vol\/lift contained in it. Adding a shower cap on top of all the extra changes is baffling. A Color Specialist noted that 1-2 shades lighter could be achieved by just adding foils to the original formula I've used for yrs or rinsing out @ 30 mins instead of 45 mins. Also, CTA= gloss, & professionals never tone 3ft-long blond hair.

The TL should have never bumped me up to 40 vol, especially w\/shower cap. This is significant b\/c I asked her, as we looked at my written formula & instructions, if she could only change 1 number, which would it be, & she responded that she wouldn't; she'd change both!!!! I also discovered that TL was NOT S's official Educator. (I'm not sure if TL took over my hair b\/c she wanted to experiment w\/ it, but it's hard NOT to consider this her true motive.)

The formula TL used on my already-blond hair caused 5 levels of lift (not 1-2 shades), which explains the polar bear white. She stripped my crown of all color by highlighting my whole head, & even bleached my scalp. It flaked & itched. If she didn't expect my hair to turn white, then, tell me, WHAT COLOR DID SHE EXPECT IT TO TURN?

TL excels in other areas, but TL does not truly understand blonding or Deep. Will take 6 years to grow out permanently altered & damaged hair and about $1K to patch up. This color service set me back K's 4 time, gas, both corrective & blue\/purpl products; & they're not paying me back. Now, I have hi maintenance hair & may have 2 cut short it in the future d\/t drynessI can't speak for other Educators at this institute, but I can speak for the TL, & seriously question AIPs adherence to industry Best Practices, Aveda superior standards, & basic ethics.

There are many reasons why we haven't come back to this spa but since we've heard about how recent renovations made this place ""so much better"" curiosity finally got the best of us... and we paid the price for it... literally.

THE GOOD

- The place is visually appealing : If you're here early enough to experience the site with very few present people. Everything looks really esthetically nice with a beautiful forest and river to look at only a few steps away. I personally liked the docks and the seats near the forest and spent some time there. Since it was nearly October, the staff decorated the place with what seemed like a hundred pumpkins. It was all very pretty.

THE MEH

- The massage experience : As a massage lover, I tend to get a massage about once a month or so and already have my established spots to go to. However, I'm always open to new experiences so if you like a very light massage with very little effect to your body, Le Finlandais is the place to go. Furthermore, a 60 minute massage costs you $99. If you want a ""deep massage"" it's $105. Really?? Forget the fact that this pricing is simply not competitive with so many other fine places you can visit in the area. Forget the fact that only the 60 minute option is available.... but to charge... $6 more to get a deep massage? Ridiculous.

Sure, as mentioned by other Yelpers, you can most likely wait and opt for a special opening during the day to get a cheap massage but let's be honest with ourselves, I want a turn-key, stress free experience when going to the spa and not have to check-in every so often to see if a spot opened up during the day. The last thing this place needs is even more foot traffic. There's already plenty of it.

- The lockers seem to have a new RFID bracelet system that looks cool but can be somewhat problematic. As luck would have it, my first bracelet simply didn't work on my locker... perhaps it was broken or perhaps it's because it's been marked wrong as they use a marker that easily goes away during your spa experience and needs to be re-written per client visit. Odds are, the 1st bracelet I got had this issue. So make sure you remember your locker number because the number will vanish quickly.

- There's been a few additions during the years, including a new Russian section (covered more in detail in Ugly) and some new bubble seats that seem to float on the warm baths. Let's talk about these bubbles. Overall, it's a nice experience despite the bubbles being a bit too close for comfort. My major issue is that even in 10 degree weather I got cold simply because the bubble is floating a bit too much. Most of my legs and my butt were comfortable but my upper body and my knees?? were actually cold. If the bubble was deeper into the water the experience could be far more enjoyable.

- The staff is very present, in fact so much so they seriously add to the ""busiest spa ever"" experience. They seem really good at what they do, they are present and I saw them repeatedly tell people in the pools to... SHUT UP! Then I caught staff chilling out and chatting it up themselves when they weren't busy for minutes on end.

THE UGLY

- If you like seeing lots of people in swimsuits then you'll be in luck! If you want to feel a more traditional spa experience then avoid this place! It can truly be a fashion show with as much foot traffic as St-Catherine street trying to find chairs and especially hot bath space. The waiting room to get a massage is almost a claustrophobic experience with a long line-up of massage therapists waiting their turn to call their client while patrons wait in a small communal room. 

- The place isn't completely quiet as you'll always hear people talking... particularly at the hot baths. Seriously people, SHUT UP! This truly broke my spa immersion. People can always hear you even when you're walking around mumbling to each other. It sounds like MUUUMUMMMUMUUUMMUMMMUM! Annoying. The whole place sounds like a ""hushed"" library than a ""spa experience"".

- So how busy is it? Well, so busy there's a line-up to attempt use the new Russian sauna. That's right. A line-up! As if I'm at La Ronde! I checked it later when it didn't have one but how awkward it was trying to quietly slip between people to your small wet seat. ICH!!!

- Do come here with your own personal robe and water bottles or be prepared to pay the price. We brought our water bottles but I didn't bring my robe since we have been lavishly spoiled and pampered at other spa places that always provided them you them free of cost. A single robe rental here is an expensive $9. I could understand a few bucks but almost a Sir John A. Macdonald dollar bill? Outright thievery!!!",Beauty
DdFiVb2LQdTesrZOoBhU1A,Dh4HFUiw9Ip5wFQM_kEbbw,h36qA5gnNTgByhxWx1aH-Q,2013-05-20,"Having opened just at the start of December as part of the sexy Ossington food scene, the place has been a-buzz non-stop. That isn't surprising, really, considering the massive python of a snaking line up they'd be touting at each and every event they would participate in. I myself always knew it was well worth getting in that line, and I knew it would likewise be worth a line up here. Yep, like so many hot spots in the city with limited seating (72 in total) and relatively quick turn around, RLC doesn't take reservations. Thankfully for us, we just slipped in under the radar (at the early hour of 7:30) and landed a deuce right away and by 9 PM on a chilly Saturday night, the place was completely packed. In such small quarters, that not surprisingly translates itself to me speaking at a higher than normal decibel and then paying for it when I wake up sounding a little like a slightly more classy version of a blue-haired cartoon character whose name rhymes with Narge. Yeah, it's loud in there, but honestly no more so than every other restaurant I've visited of late, and I'll always choose hearing music and chatter over the abrasive sound of cutlery in a hauntingly quiet space. Especially if said chatter is coming from a table of eight (yes eight!) good looking men to my left. Single (or not so single) ladies, take note. Lobster is inherently hot.

Service at RLC was friendly and efficient. Cocktails were delivered almost immediately, water glasses were refilled, and the food began emerging surprisingly quick. Only 40 minutes in, and we were ready for dessert, and yet, I thankfully was never made to feel the push to gobble up and leave. When all was said and done, we were in and out in about 1 1\/2 hours, which is my preferred casual dining time.
The cocktail menu, created by Josh Lindley (of Campagnolo and GwaiLo), is incredibly enticing and exciting, offering a wide range of some of my favourite seasonal flavour profiles. In addition to the 7 cocktails and the 4 draught beers, Lindley also features 3 wines on tap, a unique bar feature that's a steal at only $1 per oz (for Ontario). But it wasn't until after the fact that I even cared to look at the drink menu, because I had my heart on one thing and one thing only- their signature Rock Lobster Caesar ($12). A Caesar girl as it is, I just had to look around the room at all of the lobster tail adorned cocktails to know what I'd be drinking that night. And this Caesar is a fiery version, for sure, with an extra kick from the pepper-heavy, satisfyingly salty steak seasonings along the rim. While I probably would have preferred a touch more Clamato to balance out all the heat, I was really impressed by the generous lobster tail peeking out of the top of my glass. An appropriate warm up to our imminent lobster marathon.

And speaking of said marathon, this is what we had:

Lobster Poutine: Yukon Gold Hand-cut Fries, Lobster Bisque Gravy, Quebec Curds, Fresh Lobster and Chives ($13)
Off to a decadent start. Hidden beneath a much-appreciated Mount Everest of sumptuous lobster bits laid a bed of seemingly sturdy fries. Despite the generous portion of protein, and the even cover of gravy, the fries remained crispy and light for our (albeit short) eating episode. And while the lobster was fresh and tender, and the curds let out a gentle squeak, it was the gravy that sent me into a mild state of anxiety as the portion started to shrink. With characteristics of any good bisque, it was creamy without a burdensome weight, and salty but with a hint of natural sweetness to balance. It was the kind of gravy I could happily drown my low- fat Special K with and feel simultaneously both virtuous and indulgent.

Lobster Mac and Cheese: Fresh Lobster, Aged Canadian Cheddar and Panko Crust ($13)

Classic and comforting, with no need for contrasting colours, shapes, unique plating or garnishes, and yet, it truly looked like a blue ribbon dish. Appearance aside, this preparation is my preferred ""style"" of a mac n' cheese- adequate sauce coverage, lots of cheesy pull, and a crispy golden crust on top.  It definitely wasn't as lobster-laden as the poutine, but the bits were chopped more coarsely, so that some bites were practically just shellfish with a little cheese. When you hit that gold, it's not something to complain about, really. With regards to the MnC itself, I found the flavour to be a little more subdued than I would normally want, however, in retrospect, I wonder if a more pungent cheese may have completely dominated the delicate shellfish.  Regardless, a tasty, decadent dish in a generous portion for sharing.

Surf and Turf Steak Tartare: Steak Tartare and Vanilla Butter Poached Lobster, Yukon Chips and Sea Salt ($12)

From the menu description, we were both expecting a portion of steak tartare AND some part of the poached lobster separately....",Restaurant
fZqQ8iDEqQx6V9St6w5dJw,BRIhmqGB8MYZ9iyMRaUHhg,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,2015-03-02,"Okay, I normally give a long-winded, critical  review, especially given the three stars I feel my experience at this place deserved.  I feel like being less harsh than normal because 1. We may have just come in on a short-staffed night (which makes no sense because the ASD convention is going on and they're right down the street) and 2. They're brand-new and hopefully working out the kinks. 

We walked in, no hostess immediately there to greet us and all other employees were in the dining room. A blue shirt-clad man arrives from outside to seat us, walks us to the dining room and halfway through, hands us off to a short female, who I can't tell if she is a hostess or server. She seats us. 

 As I sit down, I notice a glass on my side of the table with a noticeable, half-washed off lipstick stain on the rim...... I tried to be polite and waited until she picked it up to pour water in it for her to notice it, as I didn't want to make her feel bad. She didn't notice and instead put it back in front of me. At this point, I was a little annoyed. I quietly asked for another glass as mine had not been washed correctly. She replaced it and filled it again, apologizing minimally for what I feel was a pretty bad flub. 

About 15 minutes later, we ordered the Chicken Tikka and the butter chicken flatbread, this time from the blue shirt man. My hubby likes to ask about the menu on our first visits to restaurants to get the best choice, but the man we spoke to seemed like he had somewhere to be and was rushed in his explanation. We spoke to him for about 3-5 minutes but didn't feel educated on the menu as it was pretty large. 

Once we got our meals (20 mins later), delivered by a food runner, we were pretty much left alone. My water was empty for the majority of my meal, which is basically a medium sized chicken pizza. We drank from hubby's glass until his was empty, as well. 

Nobody came to fill our glasses until the table next to ours got theirs filled- we asked for water and we were forgotten about. We only got water after the table adjacent got served, even though we waited about 25 minutes longer, by the short female. 

We were then left alone again- dirty plates in front of us and all- for another 15-20 mins as everyone else continued to get served. 

We had to flag down the short female again to order dessert (chocolate samosas and a paan shot) and she left without taking the dirty dishes. 

I asked for a takeout box which she forgot. Dessert comes and our dirty dishes are awkwardly cleared while the dessert is placed at the same time. 

We eat the dessert (samosas were tough to eat- the bread-like pastry was a hard shell throughout). No more water came after the last fill. Once we finished, we sat for 20 mins more without being given a check, given a takeout box, or spoken to for that matter. 

The short female comes along eventually and asks if we want anything else. We asked for the check, which she forgot. 

15 mins later we flag down the blue shirt man and ask for the check. He forgets. We double-check and ask again and he brings it quietly. We immediately put our card in in the hopes we could get out faster, and of course he rushes it back to us and attempts to say bye and thanks in a nice manner as we get our card back. We left a MORE THAN generous tip ($60.00 check for the two of us) after this sub-par service received. 

I really wanted to love this place- we have plenty of friends that had great things to say- but I just can't after today. 

This isn't an angry review by any means to defame or to knock down this business- I just really hope that it's used as constructive criticism for future customers. Please train your employees on 5-star quality service- the service matters just as much, if not more, than the food, in my opinion. The service itself is a product of your business- it will speak volumes on how much you care about your customers. I hope things change -if- we come back.",Restaurant
11Wt7gMHUy21Cx90UEsaVA,RSAHZjr2yPZHZ-HhrgCrXQ,PAcD-1Z6iLxupFAYub_kXA,2010-11-29,"Oh Yelp, I know I've been a bad girl and it's been almost *gasp* Two Months since my last review....please forgive me, I had some big exams and I felt the need to find something very special for my 100th review. Patience is not one of my best virtues, but this time, it definitely was worth the wait.

Those who know me even just a little can attest to my love of books, my collection is my pride and joy. I've been privileged to spend countless hours in stores across North America that rank in the ""Top 10"" consistently, including: The Strand, City Lights, Powell's, McNally Robinson and Elliott Bay. There is something special about these booksellers that draw us in with their abundance of personality and special attention to the product they bring into their stores. They are run BY book lovers, FOR book lovers. At these stores you will not find the glassy-eyed teenager stocking the shelves, who doesn't know the difference between Tolstoy and Tolkien; you will find knowledgeable people who have a true passion for the written word.

My number one bookstore for the past 10 years has been Wessel and Lieberman Booksellers in Pioneer Square in Seattle. It is everything a bookstore should be, quiet, warm, inviting, and perfect for myself since they specialize in rare and out-of-print books. Two of my most prized Children's Books with hand-painted block art images are from that very store....and from now on, they have to share my number one spot with Loganberry Books in Shaker Heights.

Finding myself out for the Larchmere Holiday Stroll and Bazaar Bizarre on Friday, this store was the saving grace for an afternoon out in the cold wind. Up until my visit to Loganberry, I had been trying to find a great bookstore in Cleveland and had been quite disappointed. Yes, even the lauded Joseph-Beth's left me hanging, it had the ""big box"" feel to it. Back to Loganberry, I sit here trying to put just how I felt into words and find that I am at a loss....it was like reconnecting with a beloved friend after years of being apart combined with the anguish that you have at the reunion when thinking of all the potential treasured moments lost during that separation. Yeah, I'm a sap when it comes to literature....

The store itself is cozy and inviting, and not in a small sense either! It's one of the most well-appointed independent bookstores I've ever been to. The sections are laid out with grace and flair, allowing for easy browsing and the discovery of new jewels for your collection. Two of Loganberry's sections deserve praise above all others....their Children's section and something they like to call The Sanctuary.

It is one of the best Children's sections I have ever seen. You can get beautiful illustrated picture books for your little ones to read at night right alongside classic young reader novels and more for a teenager to choose other than the ""Twilight"" series (I've read it, it's good, but there is definitely more out there than just Jacob and Edward). Trying to find cherished books from your childhood? They've got them. Even my dad would be able to find stuff here, we ran across a bunch of Zane Grey...probably because he was born in Ohio, but still, there were about 5 of his Westerns sitting on the shelf! The only wish that I would have of the Children's section is to bring in some more high-end collector's books. They do have some rather lovely re-bound classics and a number of first-editions, but even more books with fine illustrations by people like Charles van Sandwyk would knock it out of the park.

The Sanctuary is like the Secret Garden except with books! A large room at the back of the store dedicated to fragile and delicate books, not necessarily expensive ones, but books that deserve special handling and treatment. Most of the titles are behind glass doors that the employees will kindly open at your request. Once again, a beautiful selection of Children's lit; a full shelf of Alice to choose my favorite from....I came away with a limited release illustrated version. Don't even ask the price, one of my favorite quotes is from Erasmus...""When I get a little money, I buy books; and if any is left, I buy food and clothes.""

I doubt my review will sway anyone not already familiar with this place to head to Loganberry's....judging by the crowd on Friday; it seems that all the literary people in Cleveland already have made this store their home. This store deserves and, even more importantly, looks like it RECEIVES support from the community. Seeing the glow in the eyes of a young girl wandering around the Children's section as she picked up book after book, searching for that special one to take home and crack the binding...it made me think maybe all is not lost in these dark days of the Kindle.

I do not profess to being a good writer, and, in truth, Loganberry deserves much better than my rambling review, but it merits my frank praise, as do Independent Booksellers everywhere.....

I've been there many times since, happily introducing my family and a handful of friends to this fun little burger place, and it's definitely at the top of my list for ""best burger joint.""

With a trendy indoor dining and bar area and fantastic little outdoor section (located upstairs, with a view of...well, the street...but still nice), this place is perfect any time of year (the upper area is open even in the wintertime, thanks to a generous collection of heating units and patio torches). If you're not looking for a burger, you should avoid it, because that's about all you're going to find on their menu (aside from a salad or two and a selection of fattening but oh-so-delicious sides). This place is called BRGR (supposed to kind of look like and sound like ""burger,"" I believe) for a reason: they offer burgers; handcrafted, sloppy, delicious burgers. On top of traditional beef patties (topped with ingredients that actually make them far from traditional), the restaurant also offers a selection of nontraditional burgers (tuna, turkey, vegetarian, salmon, and more, depending on the season and the chef's changing interests). Some burgers, like the kobe beef burger, are pretty much always available, while others come and go throughout the year (my favorite disappearing burger was an amazing lamb burger with Greek cheese, cucumber, and other Mediterranean-ish ingredients). The ""Average Joe"" is about as basic as you get, but I recommend you travel outside your comfort zone and try one of their other delicious, handcrafted creations: ""Fire in the Hole"" (with jalapenos and sriracha, for those who like a little heat), ""California Lovin'"" (a  turkey burger that will make you rethink the whole concept of turkey--it's not just for Thanksgiving and school lunch sandwiches anymore), ""Kamikazi"" (the best sushi ever, but burger-style), and ""Kobe Beef"" (featuring bleu cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes, and other deliciousness). Be sure to add a side of fries with truffle cheese whiz (this is not your average cheese out of a can--it's a creamy cheese sauce blended with truffle oil), or perhaps the house-made chips (served with ""crack dip,"" an amazing concoction that should come with all chips ever). If you have a dessert stomach, like me, or if you simply plan ahead and don't stuff yourself, save room for one of their spiked milkshakes. ""Salty Caramel""--made with vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, sea salt, and bourbon--is phenomenal. ""Cupajoe"" is great for coffee and chocolate lovers alike, and non-alcoholic shakes are available for the kiddos. Aside from all of this, they have a pretty good beer selection and offer mixed drinks too.

This is a fun place to head to with friends, or visit for a casual date night, and it's in a great location (near lots of shopping and a few other restaurants). Parking can be a bit tricky (you can't park in the garage across the street, because it's reserved for shoppers at that shopping ""mall"" area), and the area a few blocks over is a wee bit sketchy, but neither of these things are major issues.

So, if you've got a hankering for a burger, skip the craptastic offerings at your local fast food joint and head to BRGR. Just make sure to come on an empty stomach. And don't forget about the truffle cheese whiz. It makes everything better. Everything.",Restaurant
UyJycyFtCsFD2ayc9-3zwg,C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,d_L-rfS1vT3JMzgCUGtiow,2011-03-29,"I've got to add Border Grill to my list of Top Chef Masters restaurants that disappoint. It joins a couple other spots I've had the misfortune of visiting: Zentan by Susur Lee in Washington DC and RIck Moonen's RM Seafood Room here in Vegas. I've been to Border Grill three times now and either the quality has slipped or my expectations have risen because with each visit I leave less satisfied.

We decided to come here for a family night out -- yup, we had the kid in tow and were looking for a family-friendly spot that would make him happy and have good enough food to make us happy. They get points for having a kids menu (and they also have a gluten-free menu for anyone looking for that). Unfortunately, the food didn't thrill any of us.

The plantain empanadas ($9) are filled with a mixture of roasted plantains, black beans, poblano peppers and cotija cheese. The sweetness of the plantains dominated the flavor of the dish. I love plantains, so that isn't necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. The empanada dough was more mushy then flaky, which was a disappointment. There are four per order, so plan to share.

The Baja ceviche ($15) is a huge order of lime marinated halibut and shrimp sitting on a corn tortilla with slice avocado sitting on top. There was too much lime and the fish didn't taste all that fresh. This also seemed like a dish that was mass produced and was probably sitting around in those lime juices for quite some time.

The first entree to make it's way to the table was something off of their 'Specials' menu. It was shrimp stuffed with crab and wrapped in bacon with some sort of cilantro pesto sauce or something (I can't remember exactly) ($26). It sounded awesome, but it turned out to be a hot mess. Too much bacon, no detectable crab in or near the shrimp, and a million ingredients that over-complicated the dish.

The Negro Modelo braised short ribs ($29) were much better. It came with two large chunks of boneless beef atop corn polenta and a cherry tomato salsa fresca with a molasses habanero BBQ sauce. The beef could have been more tender, but the flavors were pretty good with a slight bitterness from the Negro Modelo and sweetness from the sauce. It wasn't overly spicy. 

The kids cheese quesadilla ($4) was filled with cotija cheese (I think?). Fine for adults, but for a 3 yr old with developing taste buds... no. He wasn't a fan. Too bad they didn't just have a cheddar\/monterey jack cheese blend.

Our little guy did get a scoop of chocolate ice cream ($3) accompanied with fresh berries. He loved the ice cream, but is still learning to like berries.

The wife and I split the flourless chocolate cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries ($10). It was heavier\/denser than we expected but still rich and chocolatey. The crust and bottom of the cake were slightly overcooked and hard.

Along with mediocre food, we had spotty service. Our server was friendly but very busy and disappeared often. This isn't fine dining but at the prices they charge they could step things up a bit. Little things like clearing empty dishes and replacing silverware would make a big difference. The whole atmosphere was more laid back then I remember (the last time we were here was probably 2+ years ago). It almost felt like a small step up from a Chevy's Fresh Mex or one of those type of places. They also charge fifty cents for water per person. Although my son didn't get water they charged him anyway.  

Another thing that was annoying was how they decided to sit people right next to us when most of the dining room was completely empty. Why not space people out more?

It was a pricey meal for what we got, but at least we were armed with a restaurant.com gift certificate. We also tried to use the Border Grill VIP card, which normally gets us a 15% discount but management said they couldn't take both the gift certificate and VIP card.",Restaurant

Anyway, I went here on a Saturday about 3 weeks ago. My bosses generously footed the bill for an ENTIRE SPA DAY as a holiday gift for myself and the only other female that works in our office. We gladly accepted this fantastical gift and scheduled our all-encompassing spa day a few months later.

Upon arriving, I naturally chose to valet. Because I'm stubborn as Hell. And my car is dirty. I parked waaay in back with all the other mediocre vehicles and hoofed it to the spa. Yeah, it's a trek! But a beautiful one. I greeted my fellow female coworkers and we anxiously sat in the main entrance\/lounge area awaiting our turn for the aerial yoga.

The Aerial Yoga
So, for me, this was the highlight of the day. The class is very small and the teacher takes you through all the appropriate steps of how to be a successful yoga aerialist. It seems intimidating at first, but if you just pay attention and take your time, it's easy enough. More importantly, I got to hang upside down like a damn bat and say ""I am DRACULA (rolled R)."" At some point, we split into groups of three and flew like freaking Superman! Being the obnoxious person that I am, my goal was to get as high as possible. To be honest I scared myself a little. The class was fully enjoyable except for one thing - which knocked off that coveted 5th star for me - there was a comment made during the class that kinda rubbed me the wrong way. One of the people in the class said, ""next we'll be doing pole dancing classes!"" and the white snooty Scottsdale teacher said, ""oh no, that's a different part of town."" Oh, you mean the part of town I live in? Alrighty then. Whatever, it's all good. Keep livin' up to that Scottsdale milk-toast white lady stereotype sister.

The locker rooms \/ lounging \/ pool \/ lunch
After the yoga, we basically did nothing but sit around until our lunch was delivered. It was hard for me to accept this since I am NOT a spa person and had a lot of work waiting for me back home, but eventually I was able to shut it down mentally and just enjoy the day. We got a tour of the whole facility, which is really lovely. You get your own little locker, a giant robe, and some sandals that kind of look like Crocs. I opted for my own flip flops. They have 2 saunas (one that's all steamy? I dunno), a waterfall spa, a hot + cold spa, and a bunch of free stuff that poor people like myself find really amazing. I kept putting on free lotion, just 'cause it was free. At one point I was blowdrying my hair and putting on fancy deodorant for no real reason. If I had a mustache, I would've twirled it and laughed like a rich person. I threw on my Gameboy one-piece swimsuit and we headed upstairs to enjoy our delicious lunch by the beautiful pool. Damn Phoenix weather, why you so good to us?

After lunch, we basically just did more lounging. I attempted to use the sauna but felt really suffocated and was like, ""you guys I don't think saunas are for me"" and decided to do handstands in the jacuzzi instead. Totally fitting in at this point.

The massage
HOLY RELAXATION BATMAN. I haven't had a massage in years, maybe only like 5 in my entire life. I got a 90 minute full-body massage and it was GLORIOUS. The masseuse was really good and I think I drooled at some point. Sorry about that. She questioned why I didn't get massages more often and I was like umm because money? I suppose I could afford at least one a year or something, but I would just rather spend my money on art supplies and make my boyfriend do it for free y'know?

The end
I was basically a slug at this point. Just dragging my limbs around like a wavy wacky inflatable tube man. I sleepily said goodbye to my girly girlfriends and drove home. Where I felt like accomplishing aboslutely nothing for the rest of the day.

The service is impeccable by the way! I don't like people waiting on me hand and foot, so I probably thanked everyone way too much. But people seemed genuinely happy to be there.",Beauty
Mdwc5lZ28iuz6YiR7EROQQ,R5i-8R4vBov0wfNBGg2MwA,IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg,2011-07-15,"I wouldn't say this was the best steak that I've eaten in my life.  But as an overall experience I would say this was one of the better steakhouses I've been to.  

I'm not usually one to blow big bucks at a steakhouse, not when we can usually prepare very good steaks at home, especially with the quality of beef you can get at mail order and high-end grocers nowadays.  Instead, I usually spend my high-end dining dollars on restaurants with multiple-course tasting menus that would be hard for me to execute at home.  Also, steakhouses usually charge extra for sides, have sky-high markups for wine, and usually don't take (or have really expensive) corkage.  However, my husband (who does most of the actual steak-cooking in the house anyway) does like to eat out for steak occasionally, and it is a nice change from all the other""frou-frou"" restaurants that I like to frequent.

I gotta say though, that this place is actually *gasp* a decent value for the money, especially for Vegas where you can easily spend $100 on a single steak.  My friend and I split one of their specials, a bone-in Wagyu Tomahawk ribeye, and it wound up costing us $45 apiece.  Our husbands, who got standalone ribeye steaks of their own (no bone) were definitely jealous as ours was just so much juicier and more tender.  I don't think I've ever been to any other steakhouse where you can get Wagyu for that much.  The steak was perfectly cooked (medium-rare of course!) and I have no complaints about it whatsoever.

The appetizers we ordered, tuna tartare and crab cake, were tasty and well-executed, though not particularly exciting.  But then, this was an old-school type of place so I wasn't exactly expecting cutting-edge.  The sides were also pretty decent...I'm not a big fan of potatoes au gratin but my dining companions enjoyed it, the mushrooms were flavorful but did not overpower the steak.  We didn't order dessert since we were already stuffed from all the steak and even had leftovers.

The drinks were good and reasonably priced as well.  We started off with their signature cocktail...a martini-like concoction with pineapple juice.  It was very refreshing and a good start to the meal.  They also had a very expansive wine list (they better since they don't let you bring outside wine) with many great selections of California cabs, my wine of choice for a good steak.  I was very pleased to note that they had a special section devoted to lesser-known producers that were also more affordable.  Unlike many other steakhouses that tend to push the customer towards higher priced wines (I'm looking at you Alexander's and Harbour Sixty), our server was very happy to talk to us about some of the smaller wineries on the list.  We finally settled on a 2007 Terra Valentine cab from Spring Mountain (one of the less famous Napa valley appellations) which went perfectly with all our steaks.  

The service overall was extremely good...they asked us at the beginning if we had a show to catch so they could pace the dinner accordingly, they called us a taxi to take us back at the perfect time, and even showed us their ""James Bond table"".  This was definitely one of the best service that I've seen for a steakhouse.

One of the best values for a steakhouse, and one of the best values overall in the city.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone craving a steak in Las Vegas.",Restaurant
56n1lyUlhrlT_uY81-MS1w,ww7SG7054VHIKz9sdXVAjw,3mHlegCgiqu3nfCncLnmoQ,2014-08-05,"Not going to lie, I was looking for a place to get a last minute massage on my day off. I called my regular spa, but she was completely booked. I tried a lot of places until I came across this one. 

I read all of the reviews on google and yelp before I went, and let me tell you I did not raise my expectations too high, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got there. 

The Location is a bit hidden, I was half an hour late to my appointment due to transit issues but once I got there I couldn't find the place! I called Maria and she gave me instructions and still took me in even though I was very late. I found this to be very nice considering they had a lot of clients.

When I walked in the vibe was fantastic. Had some real good dance music playing, a coffee bar, and I absolutely love the purple walls!

I didn't wait too long to get in, and something I really enjoyed was that they kept using my name. When my specialist came out to get me, Maria said "" Cheryl is here to have this, this, and this done. "" Rather than, ""Oh she's over there"". I really liked that because even the most premium spas have made me feel like a dollar sign rather than a person. 

When I walked into the room I was in shock. The lights were down low, the relaxing music was playing, there was a beautiful aroma to the room. I was in love with this place. 

A lady named ""Leena"" I think, did my services. She's a Ukrainian lady in case you decide to request her after seeing this review. 

She was fantastic! The massage was incredible, it was almost like it was timed to the music playing which made me almost fall asleep. She really took her time on everything, and even though it was only supposed to me an hour it seemed like it went on for a little bit longer. This goes to show they are all about quality and not quantity. 
The facial was even better. Something I really dislike about most places is that they put the steamer on your face for 20 mins and leave for lunch. Leena could tell I wasn't a fan of the steamer, so left it on for about ten mins and started right away. She was able to tell me what type of skin I had, why I was having acne issues, what products to use, and how I can help my skin. This to me is huge, because she was super professional and knowledgeable. And she was able to relay this info to me without ruining the relaxing experience. At the end, she was very honest and said that she was supposed to massage my face before the mask, but she wouldn't recommend it due to the acne bacteria spreading. Instead she gave me a longer scalp massage instead.

While the mask was on she gave me the scalp massage, and it was incredible. I was very impressed because the amount of facials I've gotten in my life, most of the time they put on the mask and walk out of the room to give you time to ""relax.""

Next was the pedicure. The room was super funky, it was gorgeous. She brought me out a coffee and started on my feet. We had great conversation. I learned a lot about her and her life, and she learned a lot about mine. My biggest pet peeve is when someone is giving you a pedicure and the person receiving it is on their phone the whole time! It's degrading and very rude. I would much rather make conversation, or even just close my eyes and relax. 

After the pedicure I went up to Maria to pay. She made sure to ask if I liked my services and I let her know how much I liked the specialist. 

I'm very pleased with their prices. I got a package for $90 which included a 1 hour facial, a 45 min facial, and a pedicure. Most places you go you'll be paying $80 for just a massage. So this is a great deal. I saw them doing eyebrows as well, the sign on the wall said 8 dollars for wax or threading in case anyone is interested!

And lastly they have $45 massages on Wednesdays. You can bet I'll be there at least once a month moving forward! Great quality service for such a great price.


A few cons on the experience, nothing too big:

I found there wasn't much oil used, I'm not a fan of too much oil but it felt a bit dry
as well. Also there could of been a bit more pressure. Both of which are mainly my 
fault because I could have spoken up and said something. Just an FYI in case anyone
goes in, you could always request a bit more pressure or oil beforehand? 

And that's it! Thank you so much for reading this review, and I hope you guys go
see Maria or Leena soon!! :)",Beauty

NEVER will I return here -- I had truly the WORST french manicure in the 26 years that I have been getting them done.  The woman who performed my main\/pedi was nice enough (tho I really grew tired of her constantly slapping my hands and feet to get them to the positions she wanted them), but she took direction on what I wanted very poorly. The pedicure was fine, though I was surprised by the extra charge for buffing the bottom of my feet (on the menu it was labeled ""callous removal -- $5"", even though I had no callouses). This buffing has always been included in a standard pedicure at any other salon I have ever been to. The french-style color on my toes was fine, though a bit heavy-handed....super thick white lines. But it was the pedicure that was such a disaster that I almost cried. I was coming in to do this as a prep for interviews that I have over the next 2 days...  and now it's all I can do to barely stick my hand out to shake hands before I withdraw them and hide them. I'm sure that sounds like I'm being much too dramatic -- but the manicure looks like I let an 8-year old do my nails. (to quote a woman who looked at my hands). I showed the manicurist the length and shape I wanted (in fact, I had already cut and shaped my right hand before I went in). She proceeded to butcher both hands. When she went to file my right hand, I didn't even pay attention -- I thought she was just buffing the ends -- and she had filed them to less than half the length that I had prepared them to so that now they are so short that the quick of my nails are sore. She also shaped them completely, in fact laughably square -- opposite of what I asked for. I made a number of attempts to try to direct her on how to reshape them and soften the corners, but she just did not get it. When I tried to reach for the file and the snips a couple of times to try to fix the disaster, she kept slapping at my hands. Finally, I just zipped my mouth and hoped to get out of there before much more damage could be done. My nails were already cut ridiculously short and uneven in both length and shape throughout all 10 fingers -- no way to fix that. Yet, before the polish started she still tried to upsell me to a gel polish that ""would last 2 weeks"". Ha! I was wrong -- the french polish job actually got worse. The white was plopped on so thickly that less than 24 hours later it is full of cracks and crazing. The clear pink has already lifted from the cuticles of all 10 fingers. I asked for a top coat (which is always standard -- you finish off a polish with a clear top coat -- but was told no, the pink is the top coat. Guess I should have gone for the gel upsell so that MAYBE my manicure could have lasted for 48 hours. NEVER NEVER NEVER have I gotten such a poor manicure, or ever even gotten a manicure that i did not like. If you are used to going to these various stripmall nail salons, you are probably accustomed to the routine that most estheticians follow in the course of a standard manicure or pedicure. Do NOT expect to get that here -- but I am sure that if you go for all of the upsell extras on their ""menu"", you might be able to put together the standard experience you get at other salons. In my case, even with some of the extras, it not only did not complete the experience, but the execution was not competent. I have called my credit card company and am disputing the charge while I wait for a phone call back from ""Amy"" or ""Ken"".  Apparently, there is a loyal following from all the other reviewers listed here -- but, if nothing else,  hopefully you will be warned to at least take a look at their price menu so that you are not surprised at what is\/is not included, be prepared for the routine of upsells, and keep a close eye on the work being performed rather than losing yourself in a magazine.
Additional note as of April 18 -- I have now been waiting 4 days for one of the managers (Ken or Amy) to return my call. Nothing. So, I've spent the first 4 hours of the day trying to call and getting a busy signal. Just now, I got through and was told that there is no manager there today, and I had to practically beg her to take my name and number down again.",Beauty

I simply stopped into this store to pick out a couple gifts for my nephews 2nd birthday (see previous review I wrote) and the owner felt the need to reach out to me in the most unprofessional way. For her to call out my family and basically write a review about the way she feels about me in a note is just out of line. I would never in a million years bring my nephew or any child into this store after seeing the array of toys scattered about. Talk about a fire hazard! To be clear, there were NO other parents in the store during my visit. The owner was the only one there and told me herself after she more then once told me the business was her ""baby and livelihood"" and said repeatedly how she was trying her best to juggle running the cash register\/store while watch her own 4 children along with a drop in child she had from a customer. If you think this is a big store then just take a look inside and see for yourself. It is narrow and filled with junk. A majority is sectioned off by baby gates. The pictures I posted are factual and exactly what I observed while there. For a place that has been in business since 2006 they sure don't have a lot of reliable reviews on yelp. That speaks volumes! The following is the response I got from the owner, Andrea... Very unprofessional. 

Comment from Andrea V. of Artsy Nannies 
Business Owner 1\/30\/2014 This exaggerated review does not help parents or children! We provide the community hundreds of FREE arts and crafts for locals and tourist alike, which bring many families to our store at one time.  When you walked into the one-door, one-window, small business (not sure exactly how big you thought the store would be once you walked in), we had just finished with one of these great, almost daily events. This was the reason for the extra families in my store. The pictures that you submitted shows train track on the floor that was obviously being played with (by CHILDREN) in the designated play area. You show a picture of a piece of paper on the floor and concrete out front of the store and call this dirty? I helped you pick out two great gifts...this is why I explained to you that my children were the ones playing and not just children being left alone. I never stated that my store was my ""baby or livelihood"". I also have EMPLOYEES who care for the children here at Town Square, hotels and homes. Every parent deserves a break! This service is utilized by thousands of parents every year here in Las Vegas and in many other parts of the country by Artsy Nannies and other businesses. You must have been distracted with the children playing that you miss understood almost everything I said. To address my children... I have four real life children whom I am trying to do the best for. My older two know better but the 3 year old and 18 month old are still working on controlling their inside voice. My children are only here with me on occasions, you have made it seem as if they are always here. I am almost 100% positive that your 2 year old nephew has a hard time with his inside voice as well. Regarding my prices... Have you shopped at Town Square before? The shops here consist of Juicy Couture, BeBe, Armani and many other major BRANDS. Our prices are set at MSRP, we can not compete with any type of online yard sales. Your ""woman"" was correct, we sell brands just like every other thing you purchase in life. Last of all, I am not sure how I annoyed you like your ""woman"" did. I helped you find gifts, I explained the chaos and got you out of the store as fast as possible. I would have most certainly given you your money back after your ""woman"" found the gifts you chose online for a better deal. It sounds as though you waited until the last minute to find your nephew's birthday gifts and ran out of time.

I am a small woman and mother owned and operated business since 2006. This review does not help parent's, it does not help ANYONE! If you walked into the store with your nephew, your review would totally change once you saw the look in his eyes and the excitement in his voice when he saw and got to play with almost every toy in our store. Our toys are open and at their level! Think back to when you were a child. If you had the chance to build the biggest train set you've ever seen, this review would be different. If you had children that you brought to our free art classes, this review would be different. I have added a sign in our store letting customers know that children are at play and to enter at their own risk. Next time you are at Town Square, with your nephew, swing by and watch his face light up with joy. :)",Shopping

I have always gone to pricey places to get my hair colored. For years I did double process blonde(roots and highlights) with no issues. In November I decided to try being a brunette. I went a nice salon in LA and had no issues. It came out great. When I went back to my local hairdresser to touch it up, she went way too dark and made me almost black. So, stupidly I did one of those home hair painting kits for balayage, made especially for dark hair. Luckily I only did about 8-10 strands around my head because they came out orange and broken. 

I had seen Jenny's work on Instagram and contacted her. She was very nice via text. I came in to see her about two weeks later and she immediately said my hair was too damaged to do much to, she could only tone out the orange, do a Brazilian Keratin Treatment and told me to come back in a month and perhaps we could highlight.
I waited a month and went back. 

The miscommunication happened right at the start. She immediately said my hair was STILL too damaged to put bleach on. I was really disappointed because I didn't think my hair was that damaged- I'd been babying it for four weeks, and I had only messed up those few pierces- and I really wanted to at least start the process of going lighter. I know dark brown to blonde can't be done in 1-2 sessions. I asked her if we could at least put a few lighter pieces on the bottom. She said woefully, ""we can try"". The next thing I know she is doing a full balayage on my entire head. I didn't question it because 1. I did want to be lighter and 2. She is the professional. I figured she must have thought it would turn out ok or she would have flat out refused.

When she rinsed my hair(hours later) she looked a bit freaked out,  said it was too orange and needed a toner. As she started to blow dry my hair is when I almost cried. The top was dark, the middle was orange and ends were green\/gray. After already reprimanding me a few hours earlier for not telling her she needed to book out more time for me(again, miscommunication but no need to make your client feel like crap) she could see my disappointment and horror and she said ""See! I told you I didn't want to highlight you! What do you want me to do? I have a client waiting"". It was a VERY uncomfortable situation but I had an event that weekend and could not  leave like that. She agreed to put another toner in(after I suggested it). She never ONCE asked any other stylist in the shop for help. I left with a color disaster on my head, but at least the bottom wasn't green! I paid $363 and I don't even know why. I was just so frazzled and upset and wanting to cry(which has never happened in over 25 years of going to salons) I just handed over my card, signed and left. Jenny even commented on why I tipped her. Good question. I guess it's because I am in the beauty business as well(makeup artist for nearly 20 years) and she did spend 6+ hours with me. Looking back it was obviously a DUMB decision on my part. In reality I shouldn't have paid at all! A stylist with integrity would not have let me pay knowing I would be a walking advertisement and we were both unhappy!

I gave since gone to THREE separate consultations, all with color specialist with the years of experience(Jenny is very young, early 20's maybe) and they all said my hair wasn't that damaged and she just used the wrong products and panicked due to lack of experience with color correction. The stylist I chose to fix this mess has a great plan for me and asked why Jenny didn't just use Pravana color remover in the first place! It supposedly doesn't damage the hair at all. 

Jenny does a great job if you are young with virgin hair or hair that only she has touched. She clearly doesn't know much about aging hair(it has a different texture than younger hair) or color correction, and her attitude is what upset me the most. You never make a client feel like shit, ever. If she does have any professional integrity she(or the salon) will contact me and make this right. Even a refund of the gratuity I paid would be a start! The two stars is only because the Brazilian Blowout was fine.

Update: My hair is now the perfect blonde thanks to a talented stylist at another salon(message me if you want her name!)Jenny had said I should ""never put bleach on my hair again"" well, it turns out she was wrong, and I am so happy to have found someone who really knows color, and more importantly, how to treat clients.",Beauty
NZ-uPyuBU92ZupGBMqFD6g,8PoDBWpKjOSC-0XE0W_D1A,TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ,2015-01-04,"We came here New Years Eve to celebrate! 
The service was outstanding! more attentive than NOBU in Japan which I had a pleasure of experiencing on a work trip last month. Thank you (どうも 有難う 御座います) so much Adrienne. The Ambiance is great, dim lighting lighting makes for a very romantic evening for diners. You might get louder or more obnoxious dining group sitting perhaps close by which can negatively impact the atmosphere, but no way to really control that and after all we are in VEGAS!
We could not decide what we wanted to eat and decided to just set a budget per person and let the server bring us whatever her wonderful self thought would wow us.(Adrienne DID AMAZING!!!)

1. Edamame \/ Shishito Peppers: I rarely eat shishito peppers but these were fantastic! not hot ( guess I got lucky since I can't deal with HOT ) and a little sweet with the sauce. Edamame? its Edamame.......

2. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño and Cilantro
The Cilantro on with each piece was interesting but complimented the flavors greatly. I really enjoyed this and would order this again next time.

3.Live Scallop:
Thinly sliced scallop served in the tiradito-style with peruvian flavors of cilantro, spice and Japanese fusion elements. The abductor is also thinly sliced on the plate, giving contrasting flavor and texture. Although good I enjoyed the Yellowtail more than this dish. On a side note... Did someone spill the Yuzu on this dish? little overwhelming....

4. Black Cod Miso in Lettuce Butter Cups: This was one of my favorite dishes of the night ( Dessert got the number one spot sorry). This is a must eat dish and I will return to experience this one again! mmm my mouth is watering for this one right now. I would suggest to tone down the sugar.

5. Kurobuta Pork Belly Skewers and Chicken wings:
 The pork was also one of my favorite things the whole night but at that time I haven't had any dessert yet. Amazing Kurobuta Pork Belly that was braised to absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfection, although a little fatty, but people tend to enjoy the fat so I can't complain. 

6. Toro Blue Fin and Salmon which was actually two dishes. I really enjoyed the Toro more than the salmon maybe due to the fact I dislike salmon in raw form. I believe both of these dishes were so so, I rather eat the fish plain. Although to give it justice each piece had amazing flavor with different textures from the fish, capers,wasabi and garlic chips.

7: King Crab with brown sugar? and cherry tomatoes and shiso leaf:
 Truthfully I would not order this dish If I were to come back due to the fact I can go to many Vegas buffets and devour crab legs for hours. This was nothing to write home about. 

8. Sushi Platter with California Roll, Uni that was so fresh I could eat it everyday, Yakitori Unagi, And Salmon. Everything was great except the rice... this was a let down... it was hard and dry. I am surprised at the sushi chef for making nigiri with this rice.

9. Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki:
This dish was great but after eating a ton of wagyu in Japan your palette gets you and you end up craving that melt in your mouth amazingness you just don't have with any other type of beef. Maybe just stick with the Uni! haha......

10. Beef Carpaccio:
What can I say? this is as good as it gets people! eat it! enjoy it!
Although if you are looking for good Beef Carpaccio District One on Spring Mountain and Jones has some killer Carpaccio.

11. Fried Rock Shrimp something something something:
Well it was shrimp... it was very well presented and came to the table in a rock pot still sizzling. Lets just go to Hot N' Juicy Crawfish. 

12. Assortment of Desserts: 
 The desserts just kept coming, honestly this was what I came here for and If it wasn't for my brother and friend I would of just ordered every single dessert item on the menu and that would of been it. 4 courses of desserts after all the entrees had finished. The highlights included a cucumber shaved ice to die for with Yuzu syrup which they pour on the ice at your table with fresh berries, young coconut and cantaloupe sorbet did I mention it had STAR FRUIT ON TOP!!! I haven't had starfruit since I was a child living in Hawaii. Second was a Special New Years Eve only Sizzle in your mouth palette zapping of amazingness dessert it was Fuji Apple and champagne semifreddo (what word was that?) with apple cake crumble with POP ROCKS, yes I fucking said that right!!!! It had pop rocks in the cake crumble what dessert have you ever had with pop rocks plain genius! that's not it! It also had freeze dried kiwi and pineapples with dulce glaze finished with champagne foam and apple chips. They really should keep that one on the menu. Third was Pear Toban w\/ gingerbread stout cake w\/ poached pears in orange syrup w\/ toasted cinnamon ice cream and candied black walnuts, this one was a warm ""homey"" dessert but not the highlight it was presented very well on a clay looking pot wit",Restaurant
_15cViyF57Rx_FfOXceALQ,2vJ2e51kdbdAmAo_HTr4KQ,P7eL2rWn7PSAin3OjfOEuw,2011-05-24,"Okay, so I completely understand how a bad facial can ruin the entire spa experience (read my review on Stillwater Spa for further details). Fortunately for me, I never had the facial (and never will here that's for sure...thanks fellow Yelpers!) but I did have a great experience at the Windsor Arms Spa. I have been to this spa twice already, just because I had such a great time. Both times I went with my bf, and both times, we had the Couples Retreat Package which means a massage for two, pedi, mani and champagne to top it all off! My bf initially balked at the idea of getting a pedi and mani but I assured him that well maintained male hands and feet are a man-must. Nothing to be ashamed off!!!

Intro. I have always requested early-as-possible morning times for our treatments (aka 9AM). The spa is incredibly small, so in my mind, the earlier the better as to avoid too many people for the small space. The spa is on the 4th floor of the hotel and walk all the way to the end of the hallway. The receptionist is friendly and offers to take our coats, give us a tour of the spa, and points out where the snacks are. Female change-rooms are spacious and unlike Stillwater, there is seating space inside the locker room and quiet. Once outside, you can sit out in the lounge area. I have to admit, I was surprised that on both of the Saturday morning treatments, the spa was quiet. My bf and I had the entire lounge area to ourselves. FYI: The spa is located right next to the gym, but everytime I peeked through the glass doors, there was no one using the machines. 

Massage. HEAVENLY!

Now here is where my bf and I diverge in our experiences. Both times, I have had a wonderful massage. It's a couple's massage so I always get the male masseuse, and my bf always gets the female. Both times I had the same massage guy (don't know his name, but he is a bit older with grey-ish hair) and *drool* (literally...). He knows exactly which spots to knead...and knead...and knead...and I feel absolutely, amazingly, every other good ly-ending-word-there-is refreshed. My bf on the other hand has had mediocre massage experiences on both occasions but on both times as soon as he hits the bed, he konks out and snores, so that's good in my books...no?

Pedicure and Manicure

The pedi room is small with only three chairs. The first time we went it was just the two of us so we laughed and chatted to our hearts content. The second time there was another spa patron (who thankfully was about to end as we started) so it was a bit uncomfortable...as in when you're trying to sleep, but the other person is yakking away in a loud, nasally voice about her constipation problems during her trip in Mexico... FYI. Bring headphones just in case.

On both occasions, my bf and I got the same pedi and mani - curists. It's comfortable and they recognized us the second time we came back so in a way, it is like coming back home.

After every treatment, we are invited to sit back out in the lounge. Can I just say that on both occasions, the lounge was empty and this to me is all that much more LOVE for the spa considering my unfortunate lounge experience at Stillwater. Only on the second time, when my bf and I were sitting in the lounge waiting for our nails to dry (last treatment) did we see another couple. We were leaving anyways.

All in all, it could just be my experience, but on both times, the Windsor Spa was amazing. It's small, intimate, relaxing, and comfortable. It's not so commercial as the Stillwater and between the two, I would say hands up and down that this is the better one. Maybe this is not the spa for facials (as per previous Yelp reviews), but the Couples Package is definitely one of the best ones I have experienced.",Beauty
ZR9msQItaZoeSi9ASpYxig,XatXIuPzmOiOtWaDyCctJw,-sAr-LA9TsIdl37UjwBlvg,2016-05-26,"Bottom line: Boutique hotel turned up a notch.

I visit Phoenix 4 times a year and have stayed at many 3-5 star properties. I found The Clarendon through hotels.com and decided to book my recent stay as I celebrated my Nephews graduation. After my first experience .... my future stays will be with this hotel... booked direct.... they deserve the entire rate.... not 75% as happens with hotels.com reservations.

This independent hotel took over a property that has had many lives.... some not so good.... the recent takeover and renovation has this centrally located gem shinning once again. 

There's a small resort fee on top of the room rate... really small.... even though I prefer the day when the hotel rate was the hotel rate I understanding the only way to compete in todays rate driven world is to quote your lowest rate and then apply add-ons.... thank you Airlines, rental cars and hotels....  Either way... the end result ..... you get value for what you pay to stay at the Clarendon. 

The Clarendon is hip without being obnoxious. There is a youth driven vibe about the place yet this 56 year old chubby reviewer felt completely at home and respected\/appreciated by staff. The building is a square hotel open in the center with pool & spa. There's plenty of self parking... 50% covered.... The pool and spa area take advantage of the greenery and bold colors of the interior space. The pool furniture is well maintained with cushioned seating areas .... some private some not. There are plenty of towels and ice water provided. There is a waterfall wall that provides a soothing backdrop. Cocktails and snacks are available at the pool from the onsite restaurant ""Café Tranquilo"".... There is party music playing at the pool... not too loud as to interfere with a conversation but loud enough to create a spirited pool\/resort experience. One of my very few constructive comments would be that the pool area could use a staff members attention more frequently to clean up towels, glasses, plates..etc. Unfortunately ... the trash from an ill mannered guest can cheapen an environment considerably.

I booked a one bedroom suite with pool view. The finishes are hard and dramatic with the exception of the bed.... all white .... impeccably clean, comfortable and cushy. By hard and dramatic... I mean concrete walls....black granite like counter tops ...industrial carpet tiles (actually works beautifully) ..... bold colors.... wonderful Arizona character artwork. The room has all the amenities you'd want. Bulk quality bath products.... ""yeah"" to not adding to the landfill with tiny bottles... robes .... Keurig coffee maker and a staff willing to give you extra coffee and tea with an absolutely ""no problem"" attitude. Refrigerator... flat screen TV's ....etc.

There are some fun extras.... no ice machines at this property... ice is delivered to your room... a nice sealed bag.... a mini version of what you'd buy at the store..... no more wondering who's hand and God know what else your ice has been exposed to.... They have a list of snacks at the front desk for free.... chips... granola bars .... sodas...... nice touch.... you see an effort at taking extra steps to impress and take care of their guests.  Complimentary Bike rentals are also available. 

There is a roof top deck with bar. Nice cushioned furniture with a metropolitan backdrop of Camelback mountain and the Phoenix skyline. Fun personable staff. Complimentary wine reception for an hour each evening... live jazz a couple nights a week.

The onsite restaurant "" Café Tranquilo"" surprised me ... it was that good. With the exception of the restaurant bar pouring very conservative liquor to mixer drinks (hey.... I'm far from a ranging alcoholic... and I clearly understand responsible liquor management .... but I would like to taste the scotch in my scotch and soda). This last constructive comment was clearly out of line with the culture of the entire property. Most bars who use shot glasses to  measure alcohol will start a little pour before\/after giving you about a shot and half.... fair deal... this restaurant didn't do that. OTHERWISE.... the restaurant was a huge surprise. Definitely a quality eatery that could easily stand on it's own. We have appetizers at the roof bar, dinner in the restaurant and breakfast the following morning. All excellent. The menu answers to the Arizona heritage beautifully. The staff was cordial and professional.

I'm not a super YELPER with hundreds of reviews... I've posted a fair share.... usually when I'm overly impressed or overly pissed. I am happy to post this lengthy (sorry) recommendation of this hotel",Beauty
OnKsn-lbL5c3pKL4MC1Jbw,Ll_IZTr6GnZC8SfpEU-dKg,qlE8oV6QJw0an9FX64s1MQ,2014-07-09,"Absolutely terrible service from these folks, I would highly suggest you purchase elsewhere. 

Before they get your money, they are beyond helpful. But once you've paid? Good luck trying to get anything resembling even the most basic service from these folks. Just trying to schedule the actual delivery of our spa was a tremendous headache. Call me crazy, but dropping ten thousand dollars on something should afford you to not be treated like you're a bother to the company, but that's not how things work at Renaissance. 

Our unit is just a few months old, but it already isn't working. We've reset the GFI switches, reset the breakers, blah blah. . .no dice. We were promised by this company that if we had any issues at all we could contact them to send out a technician. Late last week, we called, explained the problem to the accented woman who answers there (I believe that's Tanya, but I may be wrong), and she told us that Jose, their technician, would call us back later that day. A few days went by with no word from anyone at Renaissance Spas, so on Monday at 3PM, I called them back. 

The same woman as before now kept cutting me off, saying I needed to be patient, telling me that things happen. Now, I was being perfectly calm, just explaining again that we'd like to get this handled quickly (this isn't a personal spa for us, but one at a rental property that has guests coming in early next week. Guests who paid for a hot tub). The woman took my name and number, claimed this was the first time she had heard about this problem, and said their technician would call us back within an hour or so. I clarified that last bit and she confirmed that yes, he'd call back within an hour.

At 7:30 PM, while out to dinner, I received a call back from Jose, the tech for Renaissance Pools. He said, ""I get a message that I need to schedule for tomorrow or today if possible to check on your spa."" He gave me his cell number, as well as giving me the shop number to call back.  I called Jose on his cell phone at 10:50 AM the next morning (Tuesday), since I didn't want to call him late when I arrived home from dinner. We talked for a minute, during which he asked me when he could come by the property. I explained to him how he could get on property without me being there and he assured me that he would be by before 5 PM that day (Tuesday). All was well.

Except when he hadn't shown up by 4:30 PM, I thought I'd give him a follow up call. I got his voicemail and left a message. No response. 

Cut to today, Wednesday. Still no response or visit from Jose by noon, so I called again and left another voicemail. No response. I called him again at 1:20 and left a voicemail. No response.

Frustrated at the total lack of communication here (hello? This guy is just going to walk on to my property, I sort of need to know when to expect him so the dogs aren't out\/ etc etc), I called Renaissance Pools again. This time, I spoke to a gentleman. I started to calmly explain my frustration here, but was cut off. ""Ma'am. I have another call I have to take. I don't have time to deal with this. I need your information and that's all I can do."" Gee, great service. For the record, I can't know for sure, but the voice was very similar to our salesman\/the owner we worked with in purchasing the unit. I gave the man my name, my phone number, and explained that we need a call back about this today. He said fine and hung up.

Give your money to a company that knows how to properly treat their customers. At this point, I'm going to have to file a BBB complaint on these people, just to get them to honor their service here. 

Beyond that, we were assured by the gentleman who sold us the unit that it barely used any electricity and wouldn't have a negative effect on our bill. I can tell you one thing: our bills are up SUBSTANTIALLY from this same time last summer and the only difference is that spa unit. Sure, it might be a coincidence, but it's awfully odd timing if it is.

UPDATE: It took several more days with no communication, but the tech finally made it out to the house while i was out of town for work. He claimed that the breaker just needed to be reset (which is odd, because we had done that, but weirder things have happened), reset it, then left. He called me and said he was here less than 10 minutes. Because it wasn't a warranty issue with the spa, he told me ""the office"" would ""probably"" be sending me a bill. Alright.

Cut to the other day, I get a COLLECTION LETTER in the mail. Not an invoice. Not a request for payment. A demand letter labeled ""COLLECTION."" What the hell? Oh, and it's for $190. So, just so we're clear, 10 minutes of their tech's time -- where he admits he just flipped one switch-- is worth $190. Meaning his hourly rate is $1140 AN HOUR. 

And that's AFTER I had to chase these unprofessional, rude people down for days and days. Take your money elsewhere.",Shopping
zQmZfmPzdbMo1_YNV8obwg,bLNhF5cDTczxLi0ydufzqw,bRntmjztJ4dFDA_LYiEECw,2011-05-18,"I really hate writing this review, because I was so excited to go here but my experience was not a good one.

I called early in the afternoon to make a reservation for two for later that day and was told that though they were booked up for the evening, they had one last available reservation for two for 930pm. I said I would take it and was asked for my phone number so they could call and confirm the reservation later on. I'm new in town and, at the time, all I had was an Alberta number. When I reeled it off, the hostess asked if I had a local number and when I said no, she said, 'Okay, well we won't be ringing that, so you should just show up.' I was a little miffed about that but figured, whatever, I hear it's a small place, maybe they don't want to run up their bills with expensive calls.

We showed up on time and when I gave my name, was told there was no reservation listed under that name. ""What time was it for again?"" the guy asked. When I reiterated that it was definitely 930pm, he told me that they don't take reservations that late in the evening because they're so busy and he doesn't know why I was told I had one. He told us to take a walk around town and he would call when a table opened up.

At this stage I was pretty disappointed, but I agreed. Luckily, they called literally right as we stepped out the door. (We were able to provide them with a Toronto number before leaving -- I hadn't even bothered to bring my phone with me since I was told it was no good earlier in the day.) We arrived back and were given a table right in front of the counter. We ordered a tomato and cheese quiche and an open sandwich with a couple of drinks.

The quiche came first and I noticed that it didn't look like the tomato and cheese quiche in the window. I guess the waiter noticed the confused look on my face because I saw the recognition register and I took it as an invitation to ask if it was what I had ordered.

""Oh yeah, the ... what was it you ordered? The tomato and cheese quiche, yeah! Yeah, that's actually different to what it says on the menu. It's got salmon in it, so I figured you wouldn't want that, because it's a totally different flavour, right? So I grabbed this. It's mushroom and zucchini and then I just threw a bunch of cheese on top because it didn't look very cheesy. It's really good, trust me!""

Usually, I'm fine with the waiter recommending stuff if something I want isn't available, but we weren't told when we ordered and I'm pretty sure he would have left it if I hadn't done a double-take when he brought over my food. We weren't given the option to order something else (and neither of us liking mushrooms, we totally would have) and we were sitting four feet from the counter! They easily could have explained and asked us if we wanted to order something else instead. On the plus side, the sandwich and the drinks (a couple of their milkshakes and a hot chocolate) were lovely!

I so wanted to like this place, and I loved the games -- hence the two stars! We played Battleship and a whole bunch of kids games that we had never heard of. Sadly, the experience with the food was more than a little lame and the staff didn't really seem to care. I also noticed at one point that everyone was outside smoking. I couldn't see a single employee manning the counter or register. I'm hoping that my sight failed me, and there was someone there, bent down stocking shelves or something, but I'm pretty sure that was not the case. 

I'll be back when my sister is in town, because it's a really unique idea and we have nothing like it at home (and I did really love all the games!!!), but I'm going to be calling well in advance, requesting an early reservation and making sure we eat before we go.",Shopping

As they are now open 24 hours, we came late last night at around 11. Even though it's late, the time didn't matter because it's happened already before during mid-day, & even when the place isn't crowded. It always happens or maybe I'm just exaggerating because I've seen it happen to others as well but here's the problem: they give smoothies we've ordered to another customer who actually ordered not right after us but a good five to ten minutes after us. This is quite irritable because, yes I understand everyone wants their smoothies, but that includes me and I'm sure anyone wouldn't like this to happen to them constantly. It's not just that, the time is lengthy for a ""fast"" service as everyone had said. Expect to wait for 10-15 minutes for a smoothie or two. If it happens once, it's okay. Twice, I give grace. But three times? They need a follow up with the way they manage things. It happened that last night, the other customer decided to raise his hand claiming that the smoothies coming out were theirs without the worker not asking who they are or making sure it's theirs. As soon as he brought out a pair of smoothies, they quickly assumed it's theirs. They take our names after placing the order, but I noticed they are never consistent with actually calling it which I assume is the intention of asking for the name of the person who makes the order in the first place. In fact, I'm even more disappointed that they don't seem to make sure ever that they are giving orders to the right people\/party. Well, as the customers who got our order started drinking it, not even long but 2 minutes after, the same worker comes out calling out that customers name. I had been watching this happen of course, and from the beginning that he got drinks before us even though we ordered far long before him, I felt I am in no place to go to their table and to have to voice my belief that those are supposed to be mines. I did not choose to stare as I had already looked at them and felt that they realized it was our drinks when his actually drinks came out. I overheard them saying ""I feel bad for whosever drinks those were"". Not sure if they ordered the same drinks or what but the worker went back to the kitchen. They other customers left right after, probably in guilt, embarrassment or awkwardness because everyone that was there may have heard or that it was ours. Not sure which drinks, whether it was his (if he ordered the same we did) or if it were mines that he already drank that might have went back to the kitchen but it came out a minute after the worker went back in. As I finally received it, it was given to us quickly and the worker had not said anything but just politely as he could, he placed the smoothies we ordered in front of us. I took it, and left home because I felt our wait was long past my expectation. We were given the correct drinks and it felt that that was all that mattered at the moment. I did not feel in the beginning that I needed a receipt, so I didn't have that but I realized when I put in my straw when I was on the way home, the drink was quite melted and the amount that was given may have seemed like it was actually the ones the other people had had (someone already drank some of it). This is what I believe, and I wish I had watched everything to see if they which smoothies, the ones they drank or the second ones that were brought to him. It honestly just seemed like within the minute after he went back to the kitchen, he may have switched to new caps? They always take long, so I assumed I really did get the guys' order (the second ones that came out) or we got ours which they already drank. It's either or but I would probably not be surprised if I was correct. If we got the new ones, I feel he would have not needed to go back to the kitchen. 
But because our orders have been given to other customers the past 3 times, this is not any customer's fault even if they believe it's their food\/drinks that are coming out but it is the responsibility of the team at TSC. I really hope the management changes & I don't believe that this should make anyone that it's happened to or that it might happen to, to feel unlucky. 

They need to simply fix this by making sure they know who they are giving it to, use the names they ask when it's ordered and call it when the order is ready and make sure it's really whose it is. THIS NEEDS TO FIXED. I've been here since a few years ago and hate to start disliking it and I would hate to have to give honest recommendation to  others to not come to this location.",Restaurant
Ay5-nxJg9xMVo7vpakEvRQ,gPVEMx8aK7ghaTU-BNaQkQ,59k5QxAyJ3bVEP8-23005A,2016-09-03,"I thought we were in good hands with our purchase because we were buying our new garage door and motor through Costco. Costco stands behind their products and services but this experience was terrible. 

In mid-May 2016, our Lodi Garage Door sales rep, Mark, promised a 15% Costco cash rebate, saying that even though the promotion ended two days prior that he would honor it. We chose our door, windows and motor and had to wait more than a month for our new door to arrive because it was wider than the standard size. I should have known something was wrong when I looked at the contract after he left and didn't see any mention of the 15% rebate, and when I called to confirm I was still getting the extra 5% within five minutes of him leaving, he didn't answer and never returned my call. We paid everything up front, and he was outta there. (Fortunately, I do have the proposal he sent via email that includes mention of the 15%. Better than nothing.)

Fast forward to installation day - June 17th. Not only were the windows the WRONG size (we ordered 4 long-panel windows, and got 8 small windows) there was a gap in between the door and the ground, but only on one side. This was not the case with our prior door so I knew it was a mistake with the install. The installer looked at the paperwork and said Mark had made no mention of long panel windows on the order. He said he will contact Mark and that he would call me the same day. Naturally, no phone call came.

Within a couple weeks, the Costco card came. And guess how much was on it? DING DING DING!! That's right, just the standard 10%. I called Costco since Mark was completely unresponsive to my messages and I hate to say it, but they were no help. They said that the extra rebate had to be noted by the contractor and that I needed to connect with them. It had now been a month and not a single person had so much as lifted a finger to fix the three major problems with our garage door installation experience. When I called the main Lodi phone number and explained what happened - very nicely, despite how pissed off I was at this point - and that Mark was not returning my calls and that I would like to talk to a supervisor, the lady who answered was very rude and refused to let me speak to anyone other than Mark. She said only he can handle it and that I could call back after 1:00 and she will make sure he talks to me. Gee thanks, that is super reassuring, considering it's been more than a month since our install and NOTHING has been done to resolve this after several attempts to just get someone on the phone. It should take no more than ONE phone call if a problem arises to hear back, and here I am literally chasing him down from every angle and still, nothing.

Needless to say, when I called back, I got his voice mail. I left a message saying I would appreciate a call back and that he needs to do the right thing and have some integrity and fix the problem. Well, I guess it worked, because hallelujah! I finally got a call! Mark apologized, said he would have ""them"" put the extra 5% on the card I already have, he would order the correct window panel, and when they install it they would fix the gap in the door. He asked that I send a photo of the gap via text. So I did. 

And... radio silence. 

That was on July 19th. And I have heard NOTHING since. No new windows. No rebate added to my card. No phone call to schedule the install. And I think it is safe to assume my window panels, which take extra time to make because of their size, haven't so much as been requested. 

Under no circumstances would I EVER recommend this company to anyone, ever. What kind of customer service experience is this? They screw up three MAJOR things and can't even be bothered to return phone calls, let alone fix the problem? It shouldn't take three solid months after an installation to have a problem so much as addressed. That brings us up to four months since we paid them $2700 UP FRONT and did not get what we paid for. 

Get it together, Lodi. You have more than just my one-star review. It's time you man up and own your horrible customer experiences. You may not go out of business but you will go on knowing you operate with absolutely ZERO integrity. Not the reputation I would want in business!

And Costco... You may want to consider other garage door companies to contract with. Lodi is absolutely terrible and are ruining YOUR reputation for impeccable customer care - which is why we trusted this purchase to you!",Shopping

Now this. THIS is art I can get down with. 

On a brief visit to Pittsburgh, this was one of top items on our very limited 'To-Do' list. We opted to skip the Warhol Museum and 'go to the Mattresses' because it seemed a bit more dynamic and also, I'll be honest, cheaper. 

Now, I'm not an art fanatic by any means. I look at it, I see things, I don't feel any emotional attachment, nothing's stirred, nothing moves me. I'm just dead inside. It's just a thing I'm looking at, that means zilch to me, though I'd be more than happy to assign anything 'art' a number from 1-10 to accurately show how boring or not boring I find it. Ignorant? Yes. Most definitely. But it's honest and I'd like to think there's a bit of honor in coming clean over bullshitting through some phony explanation of why something I really don't care for is or isn't poignant, and with that being said I liked the Mattress Factory because it didn't feel like a stuffy art museum. It was fun, you could move about almost freely, no guards, just guides and at points you're even encouraged to explore and touch. 

What I liked about the Mattress factory was that it had a sense of humor. It wasn't all serious all the time as we quickly discovered upon entering the 'Breast in the Press' installation, consisting of a dark room with an absolutely enormous statue of a topless woman with comically huge breasts and a music video being projected in onto each boob to the tune of 'My Humps' by the Black-Eyed Peas, but with the words changed and the large-breasted creator of the work singing topless while smashing her inked up breasts against sheets of paper at a desk, as if she was writing the news with her fun bags. This was an exhibit we saw back in November\/December, and still, if I hear any clip of 'My Humps', I can't help but think of the Mattress Factory titty song. 

Another exhibit we walked into and 'accidentally' crushed part of. I use mini-quotes for the word 'accidentally' because at first I really did step on one of the ping pong balls littering the rectangular room on accident, but then when it popped and no one from the museum came out to yell at me I took it as free reign to do it again... and again, and again, and again and then eventually I just started picking them up started throwing them at my friends- triple words score if you hit in the testiculars! Anyway, I don't know what the artist wanted me to get from the exhibit, but I just assumed it was a test in seeing how long it took a regular museum-goer to turn delinquent and start wrecking sh*t. 

The exhibits using light were really cool. All optical illusion-y and the one pitch black room where you're only supposed to go two-at-a-time was great for scaring friends. We had a truce to not creep up or bad touch anyone in the exhibit, but of course we all failed to withhold our end of the treaty and it went from a silent 2-person exhibit to a screeching, poking, fondling, scary exhibit. Again, I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it, but somehow we all ended up interpreting it as the another 'break the rules' room. 

The doll room was creepy, but cool. As a hoarder, I appreciated being able to show my friends one place that might be scarier than mess-menagerie at my own place. Now maybe I'll invite them over. 

The room with the water was fun to jump from stone to stone and throw rocks and the sound thing hanging from the ceiling was neat if you were lucky enough to be by while someone walked over it from the floor above, but they should really make the 'Do not touch' sign bigger if they really don't want you to touch it, because I did not see that sh*t till my hands already gave it a good touch.

The mirror room was the best part next to boobs. It's kind of silly, but it felt more interactive because you have to either take your shoes off or put mesh booties on to enter. It basically a bunch of colors and dots and mirrors and a few mannequins, but you can see yourself from all angles and somehow it was more fun than a standard dressing room, though it was basically the same, but with more decoration. Our group probably would've stayed here all day if there wasn't another group waiting to go in. 

There's more to the museum than just the one building, if you leave there's an outdoor area that was awesome because I saw a lizard go down the well thing and then I tried to catch it but I almost fell in the mud and my friends were ready to move on and climb other stuff, then if you go down the back alley\/parking lot, around the corner and down up the road, you just flash your badge\/ticket stub and you can see their other exhibit made up of odd housing installations. It wasn't reveting, but I liked the little hidden words and phrases found throughout the house. It felt like getting the fortune slip out of a fortune cookie, but without having to eat it.

AMBIENCE - 3 stars (meh - boring\/any old bar and grill feel)
SERVICE - 3 stars (meh - passable\/not bad enough to complain)

This was our first time at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.

We selected:

1) Chef's favorite burger with two changes: swapped out buffalo for Kobe beef; swap ciabatta for a soft whole wheat bun.  (Chef's favorite is buffalo with spinach, carmelized onions and blue cheese with a red wine and shallot reduction sauce on ciabatta) -  approx. $25

2) Build-Your-Own - Angus beef with green asparagus, oyster mushrooms, bacon and peppercorn cream sauce on a soft onion bun - approx. $17

3) Skinny (plain) fries - approx. $3

4) Glass of house merlot ($7) and glass of Red Diamond cabernet ($10)

Both burgers were amazing.  They nailed medium rare on both.  We split them in half and shared.  We savored every bite.  We couldn't really decide which we liked better.  The flavor on the Chef's Favorite might've won by a hair, but the texture on the Build-Your-Own was much nicer than the texture on the other (the crisp bacon, al dente asparagus and earthy, slightly chewy oyster mushrooms were all a nice contrast to the tender burger and soft bun; the Chef's favorite was pretty much all soft, melt-in-your-mouth-no-teeth-necessary kind of mouthfeel.)

Fries were good; not too greasy, not too salty.  We rarely ever finish an order of fries, but we ate all of these and dipped some in our burger sauces!

House merlot was fabulous minus (boring, a bit watery, not fruity like a Merlot should be.)  Red Diamond cab was much better.  It's a $10-11 solid table wine you can find at Sam's Club.  Would've liked to see a little bit bigger selection on the wine list (there were only about 4 reds by the glass and 6-7 total.)  But I guess they want you to drink beer (extensive beer list by country.)

Service was hit-and-miss with server forgetting about us twice for a long time.  Also, right after we sat down, she came by to take our order; we asked for a couple minutes, and when she returned she brought us a check.  She had already set it on the table and started to move on before she realized she had the wrong table.  That was a precursor on the service.  It wasn't horrible, it was just thoughtless.  Either she was distracted or tired or somewhat indifferent to her job (not sure which.)

Ambience was also a disappointment.  I would've expected something unique or inventive.  Nada.  Take away the menu and the food and I could've been in any average burger place anywhere.  No hint I was in a top-tier chef's restaurant at Mandalay Bay.  Kinda noisy; too many little kids and crying babies for my thinking (we had a 10:30 PM dinner.)

But for me, food is king, and the food was grand.  We were pleasantly surprised by the bill; under $65 before gratuity.  It was yummy enough that I actually thought, ""I could come back here again...tomorrow.",Restaurant
HhqZSJbm8gjjYh86zJtS-A,b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,ZjSzUWHtnpCfjsa7CksSOg,2016-05-10,"Even though this is my 1st review on Yelp regarding The Signature at MGM Grand, I've stayed at The Signature 3 times prior. Including my recent 7 day stay on April 19, 2016 to April 26, 2016, it is 4 times.

I generally rent from a different company (Rentals by Owner Direct at the Signature) when I've stayed at The Signature.

This review is regarding my last stay from Tuesday April 19, 2016 to April 26, 2016. For this stay, I was in Tower 2, Suite 38716 (no balcony). The 38th floor is the highest floor in Tower 2

Check-in was relatively simple. I showed up a few minutes after 3pm and there wasn't a line-up at the front desk. When I checked in, I was informed that they would place a hold of my credit card for incidentals. They placed a hold of $450 on my credit card. This didn't really bother me since I had a lot of credit on the credit card that I used and I wasn't planning on using it during my stay in Las Vegas but for others, a $450 hold on a credit card might present issues. When I was checked-in, the lady from the front desk informed me that I had to go through the rental company for all issues\/requests for my room\/suite.

After checking in, I asked about the laundry room since for stays of 7 days or more, Rentals by Owner Direct gives me access to the laundry room. After mentioning this, the lady at the front desk programmed this into my room card.

I won't describe Rentals by Owner Direct since I reviewed them on their Yelp review page. This review will mainly be about my experience with the amenities\/features of staying at The Signature.

First of all, for those of you not familiar with the Signature, the Signature is connected via a passageway to the MGM Grand Casino. Depending on which tower you stay at, it is a fair walk to the MGM Grand Casino. Tower 1 is the closest and Tower 3 is the furthest from the MGM Grand Casino. I didn't time the walk but I would say that Tower 1 is probably a 7 minute walk to the MGM Grand food court and maybe a 15 minute walk to the MGM Grand lobby. Unlike most places, the entire Signature is smoke free so you shouldn't have to breathe second hand smoke until you exit out of the Signature passageway. The Signature also offers valet only parking.

There are fitness centers in Tower 1 and Tower 3. If you are staying in Tower 2 (like me), you basically have to use the fitness center in Tower 1 or Tower 3. I believe that both fitness centers are roughly the same distance from Tower 2 but I used the fitness center in Tower 3 throughout my stay. The fitness center has about 6 treadmills, some weight machines, and some stationary bicycles. I mainly used the treadmills. Depending on the time that you showed up, there were also free apples there which was great since after a good workout, an apple does help with the blood sugar.

I enjoyed The Signature's amenities. The only thing that I found annoying is that I was out late in the evenings and liked to sleep in and even though I was on the highest floor of Tower 2, on Saturday and Sunday, there appeared to be a large pool party that went on from roughly 12:00pm to 6:00pm. The sound level of the music was ""okay"" and I could probably sleep through it but occasionally the announcer would shout out from what sounded like a megaphone and the sound was annoying even on the 38th floor and woke me up. The room\/suite that I was staying at was facing the pool. I can't comment on the pool(s) since I don't swim and didn't use them.

The wireless signal was very strong in my room. However, partly due to how high my room was located and maybe the construction of the walls, cellphone reception wasn't that great (I was using T-Mobile).

I had some minor issues with my room (in room safe was locked when I checked in, shower drain was slow, issue with television, etc.) but I blame this more on the rental company and not on The Signature. When the rental company called The Signature regarding the slow shower drain, repair showed up fairly fast (under 20 minutes) and fixed it immediately. Also, after being told to contact the front desk regarding getting the in-room safe unlocked, security did show up relatively fast (~20 minutes).

Something that I didn't like (which I deducted 1 star) was that one of the washing machines in the washing machine room wasn't working and there wasn't any sign to indicate this so I poured my single use detergent into the machine only to have it wasted when I noticed that I couldn't turn on the washing machine. When I informed the front desk, the lady mentioned that she would have repair take a look at it but the following day, there was still no sign next to the machine so that someone else might put their detergent into the defective machine again. 

Since my flight back was 11:30pm and check-out was at 11:00am, The Signature held my bags for me. I tipped them when I dropped off my bags and again when I picked them up and they offered me a bottle of water both times.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at The Signature.",Beauty
awLE06w2HEJbDXK2FiD06w,MNPPBD6Jxfmyjt7mXjKWhw,ah8FbjdWiB6LO4a5r9CPxQ,2016-05-06,"I got a nail in my tire at work...my car is a 2015 Audi Quattro.  Unfortunately where the nail landed in the tire, it was right in the side and that is not a repair that can be made.  I asked around and the vast majority of people that I spoke with said I needed to replace all 4 tires to ensure the cars other systems (awd, abs, etc) operated properly.  The car only has 20,000 miles on it...and the people who said I needed to replace all 4 tires are family or people who would have had no financial gain in telling me to do so based on that information from unbiased people, I started looking for the best price for 4 new tires.  My husband and I were told by a relative that NTB had always done right by them in the past, so I looked them up and the tire price, Buy 2 Get 2 seemed too good to be true, even with their add-on  nonsense, it was a decent price..  We called NTB in Mayfield and scheduled for me to go in.  

I took my car in that afternoon and Kevin came out and I showed him the nail in my tire, he confirmed that they cannot fix that sort of puncture and I left the car in the hands of NTB.  When all was said and done it took about 2 hours to have the tires changed, balanced and an alignment done, which I didn't think was bad at all.  I did a quick wander around the car, everything seemed alright, besides the fact that the wheels(rims) were FILTHY and now covered with grease, nbd.  

When I got home I started looking closer at my wheels, Audi has ""decorative lug nut caps"" over the lugs...Audi has a special little plastic tool that is used to remove those so they can access the lug nuts.  My husband had been the one to change my spare...and he used it to remove them and put it back in the trunk.  I never thought to tell NTB to use it...they are professionals, you would think they would know how to handle this.  As it turns out, they didn't look very hard (or at all, or they could have even called me and asked where it was) for the tool and used a SCREWDRIVER to PRY the plastic lug covers out of the holes on the wheels.  In doing so, scratching, dinging, denting my wheels.  They even managed to break off some of those plastic lug caps and stuck them back in, I could poke my finger in and they were just falling out.  The rims on my car are Audi factory but they were an upcharge.  $2800 value for these rims.  I'm livid.

I call Kevin at NTB and he asks that we drive back so he can take pictures.  We do.  He tells me Jim will call me in the morning.

In the morning, I am driving to work, on the freeway I hit about 55mph, the car was shaking so badly I thought the steering wheel was going to fall off in my hands.  My husband takes the car back to NTB-they put it on their balance machine and the tech says the car is in balance...Jim takes the car to their other balance machine and as it turns out, the other machine isn't working properly.  They ""Fix"" the balancing.  Then my husband asks Jim what they plan to do to handle this wheel damage issue.  They offer to ""re-machine"" the wheels and have them repaired.  I'm not comfortable with that.  I fight for 3 days with Jim and Mike Franks the District Manager asking for new wheels.  I'm not comfortable letting NTB touch my car again...I want Audi to do the wheel swap.  Mike says that they can't replace my wheels because they are too expensive.  We come to an impasse and I finally agree to let them repair the wheels.  I take my car to the Beachwood NTB, at least this location has a 2 star review.  They did pay for a rental car during this time when they had my car, when I received a call 2 days later Jim  from the Mayfield store called to let me know the car was finished (at the Beachwood location), I never asked for a discount... Jim willingly offered up a discount on the alignment and balancing for the ""Inconvenience"", I knew something was wrong.

When I got to Beachwood, the wheels looked worse than they did when we started! It looked like they had taken a brillo pad and attempted to scratch the dings out, still dings and now scratched. I called Jim from the Mayfield store and he just kept telling me that ""Mike had written down all the info about the reason my wheels looked the way they did""  ...wrote down what?  ""Congratulations we turned your $2800 wheels into garbage?""  We went inside, got the manager from the Beachwood store and he came out and looked.  He never said anything but I could see the frustration on his face when he looked at the quality of what had been done.  By now, my husband is calling our attorney and I am crying.  I called Mike over and over until he finally called me back.  At this point, he just said that they would call Audi and buy the new wheels, the fight was over.  I didn't want NTB touching my car EVER again. They paid for the wheels and I paid Audi to install them.
At the end of the day did NTB right the situation?  Yes.  Do I feel that I would ever take my car there again?  No.",Shopping

Hubby and I came here with a friend after I found it on Yelp.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of a fairly large strip center.  There were probably 3 or 4 parties present when we arrived and as those left, new ones arrived.  The restaurant appeared to do a good amount of business.

After perusing the menu and the accompanying photo album, I ordered the following for the table:

Roti Canai
Mee Goreng
Chilli Chicken
Deep Fried Eggplant w\/Dried Shrimp & Garlic
Coconut Flavor Rice
Steamed White Rice
Mango Sticky Rice

Our friend ordered wine and hubby ordered a Tiger Beer which was described as slightly stronger than a Heineken.  The wine was not to our friend's liking, so I'm guessing if you're one who regularly drinks wine, this is not the place to order it as they only serve one brand, I believe.  Hubby enjoyed the beer, though, and since he ordered a large, he shared some of it with our friend.

I ordered the Roti Canai based on Yelp reviews not really knowing what to expect.  The tortilla\/naan was very good as was the dipping ""sauce""?  There were a few pieces of potato and a small piece of chicken w\/lots of bones in the bowl with the sauce.  I'm not sure if we were supposed to just dip the bread in the sauce or actually put the potato and chicken in the bread and wrap it up like a burrito.  Regardless, the bones in the chicken made that a little difficult so we ended up just dipping.  The sauce was quite tasty!  Note, this appetizer really isn't large enough to share.

The Mee Goreng was different than what I had had before, but it was very good.  It was weird to get some potato in that, also, but the flavors and different textures all meshed well together.  The noodles seemed different from what I had had before, but it's been so long that I can't even remember what it's supposed to be like.  Regardless, it was good.  This was our friend's favorite dish of the dinner.

The Deep Fried Eggplant wDried Shrimp & Garlic arrived next and this dish was also very flavorful.  There was a large amount of eggplant and it was fried just enough to be crispy on the outside, but still silky smooth on the inside.  Flavors were fantastic and the dried shrimp added a bit of a crunchy texture, too.

The Chilli Chicken was by far my favorite entree of the dinner.  At first taste, the chicken was a bit dry, but it tasted really good.  The heat doesn't hit immediately and the initial flavor sort of dovetailed into the heat.  Hard to describe, but the complexities to get this flavor would be difficult to reproduce (which hubby is going to try!).

The Coconut Flavor Rice was not very exciting in my opinion.  The coconut flavor was so subtle that I didn't really even taste it with all the other flavors going on.  Also, it's difficult to share two bowls of rice amongst three people when you're just given plates and chopsticks.  Forks or extra bowls need to be requested.

For dessert, I wanted to try the mango sticky rice.  I asked if they had good mangoes and they said they weren't too sweet nor too sour.  The should have been a sign right there.  It was not good.  The rice wasn't bad, but the coconut milk was a bit watery and the mango was not ripe.  Lesson learned.  Maybe next time I'll try the shave-ice concoction.

I'd come back and try different dishes at this restaurant.  I know a few to avoid already, but there are also a few I'd definitely order again.  Staff was friendly and attentive, although I think sometimes had a problem understanding our questions due to the language barrier.  Very reasonably-priced, too!",Restaurant
XGFK2xc8FfjMXqoNFf_rGQ,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,aSC-WLyJptVpziJpR98Ykg,2014-11-16,"For my final MTL a Table dinner, I went back to the Old Port to another longstanding member of my ""need to try"" list - Laurent Godbout's Chez L'Épicier. About to open a sister restaurant down in Palm Beach, Chez L'Épicier has been a highly regarded restaurant in Old Montreal since its opening. A friend of mine continues to states that one of the best meals of his life has been here. Talk like that has made my visit long overdue. Hype level was high which can be scary when dealing with restaurants. There is nothing worse than overly heighten expectations setting you up for a disappointing experience. In these instances, you just need to go in and have faith that the restaurant can shine through with excellent dishes and a fine touch.

Pre-starters, we were greeted with a cocktail of maple syrup and apple cider as well as an olive and goat cheese macaron amuse-bouche. Loved the combination in the cocktail - the acidic nature of the cider dull by the maple syrup while keeping the sweetness level strong. The macaron was a interesting idea - I had never had an non-sweet macaron before. My hatred of olives had me skeptical however the use of the creamy goat cheese eased that olive taste which I despite. Very nice level of technique.

Our first starter was a squash velouté poured over homemade sour cream, onions, squash seed nougatine, parsley juice and brown butter vinaigrette. Cool little presentation element as the velouté was poured at the table over the bowl of accent ingredients. Loved the smooth and earthy nature of the soup and how each extra item brought a nice element to pair with the squash. A perfect fall starter.

Our second starter was a slowly cold smoked trout filet with a miso and maple reduction, shallot fingerling potatoes and a maple vinegar mousse. Wonderful flaky texture to the trout with a subtle hint of sweetness from the reduction. The mousse was a quirky but nicely flavoured addition and the potatoes brought some more heft to the dish. Very good.

The first of our mains was a sea bass fillet with herb polenta, lobster juice bouillabaisse and vegetables glazed with water butter. The real star here is the bouillabaisse - if only because the lobster juice overpowered everything else. The fish itself was solid. I am not a big fan of polenta up front so while this one was well done, it didn't speak to me in any way. The vegetables were good but nothing to write home about (which is ironic as I am writing about them). Overall an okay dish. I feel like the fish should have had more of an impact in this dish.

Our final main was beef shoulder lacquered with orange and olives served with onion and rosemary butter brandade and reduced juice with Cointreau. Huge winner in my eyes. The beef shoulder was cooked perfectly - to the point where you early had to touch it for it to fall apart. Great richness to the beef and the hints of orange and Cointreau came through nicely. The brandade was excellent as well.

The first dessert was a carpaccio of compressed apples with tarragon granita and caramelized pecans. Sadly I didn't get to try it because my friend finished it off so quickly which one can definitely take as a good thing. Loved the concept overall - the tarragon being an interesting addition to apples and pecans.

The other dessert available was a tempura brownie with greek yogurt cream and white chocolate jelly. The brownie itself was moist and chocolatey - a key for me with any brownie. Personally, while the tempura was well done, I'm not sure how much of an addition it brought to the dish other than texturally. It kind of felt like an afterthought - added at the last minute to make the dish ""unique"". I enjoyed the smoothness of the yogourt cream as well as the presence of the white chocolate and strawberries. A solid finish to the dish.

I had high expectations for Chez L'Epicier and they were mostly met. Very high level technique was visible throughout the meal - the highs were oh so high. However a couple of dishes had a few elements that left us wanting more. Not things that were a big deal but when compared to the rest of the dishes, they stood out more than they should have. All in all, I was quite happy to finally cross Chez L'Epicier off my list. Looking at the regular menu after my visit, I was intrigued enough to want to come back which I suppose is all that needs to be said.

When I assume it was the busboy that took our drink order (he was wearing an apron  covered in food holding a bucket of dishes) came over to the table he had no smile whatsoever. The two young ones ordered some cokes, my aunt ordered a glass of wine and my mom a water. We had literally just sat down at our table so i didn't have much time to think. i asked if they had a specific type of beer and got a quick ""no"". He didn't let me know what they did have or explain their selection but proceeded to just point to some dusty bottle above the bar. ""That's what we got"" was the help I was given in deciding. i fealt even more rushed and he looked angry so I said ""I may need a minute to decide"". He proceded to stand there and stare at me until I gave him answer. I spouted out the first thing I saw that I remotely liked and he walked away without another word. When he came back with the drinks the cokes were obviously filled too full and when he put them one the table in front of the two little girls he says ""Dont spill these"". I was in shock. Who does this guy think he is? All this time we still havent met our waitress. Finally a woman comes to the table and without introduction shoots right to ""Are you ready to order"". What are these people in such a hurry for? We order and after way too long she comes back to tell us they were out of what we had ordered. In a restaurant that seems like theyre in a hurry to get us out, youd think they would have told us sooner. Im a vegetarian and there are NO VEGETARIAN OPTIONS besides a couple starters (not an exaggeration) I was forced to eat a hummus appetizer that was clearly store bought, disgusting, and over priced. The waitress never came to check on our table. If she was busy I would have understood but she was standing in a corner chatting it up with another waitress. Our drinks were never refilled and when my aunt realized that they had forgotten to bring her coleslaw with her sandwich that came with it we tried to get attention clearly being ignored to the point where I had to shout out a firm ""EXCUSE ME"" just to get this woman to the table. When my aunt explained that she hadnt gotten the coleslaw that was supposed to come with her meal without the slightest apology proceeded to say ""Oh yeah, they were making more and I forgot"" ....really lady? This is your apology? She brought the coleslaw over, said she'd FINALLY be back with some water and when she was walking away she licked away some coleslaw she had gotten on her hand. SHE LICKED HER HAND. 

At this point were just trying to get as far away from this place as possible. We had tickets to a show at Playhouse Square and came to this restaurant besides its right around the corner. This alone schocked us that there isnt a nicer place in their spot. The decor was horrible and not nearly what we thought it would be when we walked into a restauant near Playhouse Square. This place was just a dirty diner and dont get me wrong, I could care less about how a place looks if they have the food to makeup for it. Anyway, to end this horror story she brought our check. All on one, even though we needec it split but decided to just get out and worry about it later. She puts the check on the table and my mom says let me just give you it now and pulls her card out. Right as shes doing this the waitress says ""Ok...as she turns her back and WALKS OVER TO THE NEXT TABLE WITHOUT IT!"" Yes she comes back shortly after giving them ketchup but c'mon! This was the dinner from hell. 

I'm sorry we've inconvenienced you with our sitting and wanting to eat... Waste of money...waste of time.",Restaurant
YWH7w1kSGWvyt4vnWIf81g,f8Yi83tVYzhWFuhCRBlnNQ,31kmRcQS6SDKI_P0Ycv-VQ,2006-09-01,"So I had some pretty high expectations for this spa.  Mainly because its an Elizabeth Arden spa, it has many locations across the US in well known areas, and the website\/menu of services looked good.  

I have to tell you, I was very disappointed.  I had the Brazilian waxing and the Signature Pedicure.  I came in almost 15 min before my appointment & the person at the front desk didn't look too excited to see me.  He just dragged me to the changing area & didn't tell me about the resort.  I had to ask what the lovely pool area was & if I could use it after my services.  Then when I got passed to the changing room, the lady there just took me to a locker & didn't explain if I needed to strip down all the way or anything like that.  So I had to ask, that's fine.  Then when I was done, I didn't know where I should go.  Should I stay in the locker area or go to the sink area where she was?  So I poked around & she asked if I was done.  She then brought me to the Tranquility Room, where they have snacks, water, tea, & silence.  That was nice.  Then my technician came to get me, but she came out of an elevator, that was kinda cool.  Then the madness began.

My tech's name was Ashley.  She was fairly young.  I didn't hold this against her because I work w\/ young techs & massage therapists at my spa.  However, my gut feeling was right.  When she started to rip off the wax, she was ripping in a weird motion.  It wasn't up or down or with\/against the grain, just off.  I was doing fine for about 20 min until she kept going over the same area.  This went on for about 4 more times.  I could feel my skin start to feel tingly, that can't be good.  She kept making comments to herself like ""This stubborn hair,"" or ""You're bleeding, but that's a good thing.  It means your hair is standing up.""  At this point, I knew she was crazy!  So I told her she didn't have to get all the hair if she couldn't the first time.  HINT:  STOP IT!!!!!  The entire waxing service took almost 1.5 hours.  When she left I was in pain & my private parts were puffy from all the ripping.  And to my surprise, it wasn't even a good job.  There was still hair there!!!!  So I jumped up & waxed what I could myself.  Sad huh?  I could barely walk & put on my robe.  But I had a pedi to go to next, that should make up for it right?

Not really.  My nail tech, Marlene, was pissed that my previous appt ran over.  I have no idea if she was mad at me or my waxing lady.  In any case, she let me know it by not talking to me during the service.  I had to initiate the conversation w\/ her.  I realize that I'm the last one there, but it wasn't my fault.  Blame the waxing chick!  My pedi was pretty good & she didn't rush, it was just a little uncomfortable.  Towards the end of my pedi, I worked up the nerve to ask for the manager.  

Thank God I did!  The only reason why I gave this spa an extra star is because she (I can't remember her name) didn't make me pay for my service.  She was actually really understanding & sincere.  

Something that's also weird, they add 20% on your service when you pay , which is for gratuity & its amendable.  But, usually when you're leaving the spa you don't realize that's the tip!!!  So, you may be tipping twice if you leave something for them in the room.  I find that odd, I thought I could determine what good service is by the tip, but apparently, they did that for me.  

I don't think I'll be going back to this spa, at least not in AZ.  I may try the San Francisco location, only because I have a discount there.",Beauty
6j_hDS1SZe4aMZ1myQr6PA,oQwFLohuwcJYMd0WhCph-Q,v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,2011-04-23,"Flawless check-in: Front desk staff greeted me promptly, told me my room was ready and I was given vouchers for breakfast, welcome letters from the manager, and directions with a little map on how to navigate the grounds.  I had also forgotten my phone charger at home, so I got directions to the closest Verizon store (but not before the concierge checked to see if he had an extra charger in the stash of chargers people left behind in their hotel rooms).

The common courtyard\/garden is spectacular- there are tables & chairs that surround one side, fire pits at night, adirondack chairs on the edges, all overlooking a showcase water fountain, grass, palm trees & flowers.  Great landscaping!  There are also little nooks between hotel & villa\/cottage buildings- I stumbled across a giant lawn chess set as I was trying to get to the parking lot one day- very cool.  Room service rides around the property on big tricycles- very cool.  When I was here, there were lots of families and older folks- there was a golf tournament & Passover event so I'm guessing those are the drivers of the weekend demographics.

Hotel room was very standard and almost a disappointment if I didn't read it already in the other Yelp reviews.  I got a good deal too so I wasn't too bummed...just know that the rooms are a little dated and don't really match the Wright style of design that dominates the exterior and the common areas.  The A\/C is also very loud- I ran it during the day while I wasn't in the room and turned it off at night so I could sleep in peace.  Bed is alright- mattress is a little too springy for me, has a cushy feather bed on top and a good amount of pillows- but Westin bed it ain't.  On my last night, there was a giant and bright full moon, which I enjoyed by opening my curtains and letting the moonlight shine into my room.  There are quite a few options in different price ranges- the cottages look fun and have patios where you can sit outside...I'm guessing those cost quite a bit more.

Huge con- parking.  Valet costs $20+ a night, and Self Parking is $12...there's definitely not enough space for self parking so you're left to stalk guests who are leaving, or suck it up and park in the valet.  It's also quite a trek if you end up parking at the far end of the lot...I didn't mind since I could use the exercise, but if you have luggage or can't walk that far, be prepared to valet or be dropped off at the front entrance.  

Another con that I ended up being happy about- their spa was completely booked for Spa Week and they couldn't possibly fit in another treatment, even for a paying guest like myself.  It ended up OK, b\/c I spent the day at another resort and spa, which i liked even better.  I took a stroll though the spa area- it was attached to the main pool area which was very loud, and didn't seem as lush or pleasant as the spa I ended up going to.  The pool areas get very full- try checking out the multiple pools they have on property to see which best fits your style.  Cheap thin small pool towels too- you'll need at least 2 to cover your chair.

Really convenient- near Biltmore Fashion Park for shopping & restaurants, and not far from the highway and airport.  

All in all, it was a nice place to stay with beautiful ground and great service- I'll probably go check out another hotel the next time I'm in town, but if I find an incredible deal to the AZ Biltmore, I wouldn't hesitate to take advantage.",Restaurant

The customer service is really a hit or miss. Most of the time it's a miss because for some reason, every time I go to Ulta in the mornings or afternoons, I've always had an unpleasant experience (feeling uncomfortable, feeling rushed, workers are too hostile, feeling like I wasted my time). Now keep in mind, I visit Ulta when they're not busy. I don't like going to places when they're busy so since I have visited Ulta many times, I've grown to know when they're busy and when they're not. From my experience, all the outgoing, kind people are always the ones that are working at night. I'd recommend going to Ulta when it's an hour or two before closing because they actually genuinely want to help you. 

This review is based off of my most recent visit which was in the last week of February on a Saturday afternoon. I wanted to stop by Ulta real quick to kill time and expected them to be busy because well it's a Saturday afternoon (2 p.m.). Surprisingly Ulta wasn't busy at all, they just seemed short staffed. I applaud the people that are working the register that also greet the incoming customers at the same time even when they have a line of people. I've never had a time where I wasn't greeted so I appreciate that. Now the reason why they seemed short staffed is because it took me 15 minutes to find someone to help me when they weren't even busy. I was finally able to get someone to help me find a new foundation, but she immediately gave me an attitude when she came up to me. It seemed like she didn't want to be there, but I still continued being nice to her because I thought she was just having a bad day. I brought two of the foundations that I already own: one was a tad too orange and the other one was a bit too light. I brought the two foundations for reference hoping she'd be able to find a perfect color that was between the two shades and so that it would be easier for her to find a color for me. I asked if she could recommend some drugstore and high end foundations. She didn't even bother looking at the foundations I brought and said she doesn't know anything about drugstore. But you work in a makeup store that offers both high end and drugstore? 

I didn't want to make a quick judgement of her not having knowledge so I emailed customer service right after asking if the sales associates are supposed to be well informed in drugstore and high end products or just high end. Still haven't received an answer and it's been 4 weeks so that shows how CS accommodates their customers. 

Anyways she was still giving me an attitude and she made me uncomfortable and rushed so I just said ""Okay could you give me recommendations on high end please?"" She looked very annoyed and took me to one foundation and didn't say anything about the product. She applied it to my skin and it didn't even match my skin at all. It was orange. At this point this girl was no help at all and I felt very uncomfortable and rushed so I just said ""Oh okay this feels nice thank you!"" and she just walked away. I went to wipe the foundation off and looked around trying to see if maybe I could just match the shades myself. As I was walking around, I've noticed the girl that helped me just stood around talking to her coworker. She clearly didn't have anything to do so I don't understand why she was rushing me. This is basically what my experiences have been like when I go in the mornings or afternoons. I'd rather just stick to Sephora and if I really need something from Ulta, I'll stick to going at a later time. I highly recommend people to go at a later time too because the workers are PHENOMENAL. They never rush you, they know their information, they give you more than one recommendation, they always greet and say bye, someone immediately asks if you need help, etc. Seriously if they had workers like the people on night shift working at all times of the day, I would LOVE going to Ulta. Unfortunately, that's not the case.",Shopping
akF2fA55Q65_YcAww5Cm3w,_r97WFqU9dj0_QgwbiISxQ,ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg,2012-01-04,"After all of the hubub surrounding Copper and the rave reviews from my friends, we finally decided to give Copper a try...and were sorely disappointed. 

When we arrived at Copper, I was actually quite impressed with the interior of the house. It's well appointed and has a romantic atmosphere...you know, if you're into that sort of thing. We were seated quickly at a great table on the ""porch"" and the server even checked my coat for me. That's about where my positive comments will stop, so if you're a die hard Copper fan, you should probably stop reading.

It took about 5 minutes for us to get water, about 10 minutes after that to place our wine order, and approximately 10 more minutes for the wine to actually arrive. Fortunately, it was delicious, unfortunately, our server literally stood there and read the entire back of the wine bottle after pouring it for us...awkward, he then walked away from the table before we were able to place our food order and came back about 10 minutes later to take it. We both went for the standard Indian fare; he chose the murgh (chicken) tikka masala and I chose the chicken chettinadu. We also got plain and garlic naan and the veg samosas.

The samosas arrived are were really quite good, not greasy at all. However, there were only 2 and they were $7. I know Copper is an upscale joint, so I expected the prices, but $7 for 2 veg samosas seems a bit unreasonable to someone who has eaten Indian food before. I think the naan was $3 for 6 quarter rounds, I think you get quite a bit more for your money at other places, but all in all, it was tasty and worth the $3.

Our food finally arrived (it really took a long time considering Indian food is always pre-prepared and just has to be ladled into bowls, probably about 25-30 minutes). The best way for me to describe both of our entrees would be ""Meh."" Perhaps they're catering to a more ""upscale crowd"" or just to the masses, but the curries were hardly spicy at all and there were quite literally, only, at most, 10 small chunks of chicken in each of our bowls. I love going to Indian restaurants and being able to select my spice level, but that's not the case at Copper. You get standard, mild, American curry whether you like it or not (maybe you can ask for spicier?). I also LOVE the left-overs you typically get at an Indian restaurant. ""Free"" lunch the next day is probably one of the best parts! The portions here are quite small, so don't expect lunch. 

Aside from being totally average, the chicken tikka masala was $17. Let me repeat that, SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. For a child's portion of chicken tikka masala. My chicken chettinadu was $19, for an equally child-like portion. I suppose if you've never eaten Indian food anywhere else and have a money-tree in your yard, this is probably a great deal. However, I got got by Copper. Our check for 2 entrees, naan, one appetizer and a bottle of wine (one of the cheapest on the list) was $120. For super average Indian food. Bummer.

I realize, from other reviews, that people REALLY love Copper. Like, are OBSESSED with it. I, however, cannot join the masses and sing the praises of Copper, it's just not that good and it's incredibly over-priced. Granted, they have to pay for that super swanky East Blvd. address, but the food is nothing to go crazy over. My recommendation: Save your money and hit a hole in the wall place where $20 will get you enough food for 3 days, will actually have some flavor to it, and you'll get more service than you probably even want (and all the yummy freebies the hole in the wall places give you to snack on!).",Restaurant
yxP0tM3U0y3szIG3uzDOtg,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,NgDyxaeItFSInv7J5paGLQ,2017-03-29,"How to describe The Kettle.  Its owned by a couple of Irish ex-pats, but its not an Irish pub per se.  The contemporary Victorian style interior might trick you into believing this could be a British pub, but no its not that either.  There's plenty of TVs at the bar, so is it a sports bar?  However you wanna describe The Kettle, its most certainly a pub unique to Downtown.  I had the The Kettle on my to do list for awhile and I figured I'd come in the middle of happy hour on a Tuesday, expecting a light crowd and a chance to soak it all in.

The Kettle is located next door to La Piazza PHX (an excellent Downtown pizza joint) just north of Washington on 1st Street.  When I came in just before 5pm, I had expected to grab a seat alongside a light afternoon crowd.  To my absolute astonishment, the place was packed.  Kettle's convenient location to much of the Downtown work crowd would at least partially explain this, but a full house in a restaurant that seats upwards of 80 people?  On a Tuesday?  Before 5?  With no concert or game scheduled that night?  Holy moly.  I actually arrived just as a seat at the end of the bar was opening up so I fortunately didn't have to wait.  Once planted in the corner, I went to work.

As I said, the place is owned by a couple of Irish ex-pats (Jimmy Culleton and Tom Montgomery), and they clearly were looking to put their own spin on a European-style pub.  No bangers and mash or corned beef and cabbage here, no sir (okay there is fish and chips, but I digress).  In fact the grub here overwhelmingly American in influence.  With bar food classics like pretzels, wings, and fries with different toppings, as well as main dishes like burgers, chicken sandwiches, and even mac and cheese.  The beer selection for the day is on the chalkboard up front and their cocktail list is available upon request.

I started with the The Kettle Black's signature cocktail.  Appropriately named...The Kettle Black.  Bushmills Whiskey (from Ireland of course), Cointreau Noir (basically an orange flavored French Cognac), Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, and Cinnamon.  Refreshing drink with no almost aftertaste, though I'll admit the strength of the alcohol slowly became pronounced after awhile.  For my main dish, I said burger me.  Given the options at my disposal, the Bacon Onion Burger was simply too tempting to pass up.  Swiss cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, a bacon-onion marmalade, garlic aioli, lettuce and tomato.  Served with fries and a side of ranch.  I will say the burger wasn't as huge as I thought it would be (other Yelp photos I saw of this burger made it look ginormous), but a really good hearty burger and I loved the marmalade on this thing.  The fries were a nice compliment too as they were cooked well done on the outside, but retained a nice chewy texture inside.  For dessert, I went with the Apple Crumble.  This version was topped with vanilla gelato and a cranberry gastrique.   The portion size of this dessert was quite large and could easily be shared by two.  The soft, warm crumble soaked up that gelato just right and the combo of apple and cranberry flavors worked perfectly.

Total cost for the cocktail, main entree, dessert, tax and tip came to about $40.  The food itself was pretty reasonably priced, though the cocktail was a little bit pricey for the size at $12.  I will say the service I received was a little bit slow.  There were two bartenders working the front and it was pretty clear the one I got was still learning the ropes (didn't catch his name).  His counterpart by comparison was a machine, cranking out drinks, conversing with the bar patrons, and keeping his station organized with almost military precision.  My guy had a little bit of trouble keeping organized which meant I had to wait a bit in between meals.  Not a huge deal though as I'm sure he'll get the hang of it.  The front bar was full of regulars (primarily Downtown workers) from all age groups.  Great pub atmosphere for conversation, people watching, and to let your hair down.  Call it a pub, call it a sports bar, call it a lounge, call it whatever you want.  I call it a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",Restaurant

My husband picked this place out due to its proximity to Wolstein and the burger on a glazed donut bun that he thought would be fun for our son to try. After checking in, we were given a 20% off coupon on YELP, which would have helped a little with the disappointment, as I rate everywhere based on value for what they are. At full price, I'd never return here and not even sure that the discount would make a difference. 

We were there on a Friday night during dinner\/happy hour time. The front dining room was at about 1\/3 capacity and the back bar about 2\/3 of the seating was occupied. When we first entered, the place was full of grill smoke. I'm not sure if this is always the case, but something was definitely wrong with their ventilation system. This is the type of restaurant where you order at the counter and then they bring out your food to your table. There are several bottled and draft beers available at the counter with a full bar if you continue to walk further back into the restaurant. The hip chalkboard menu listed a huge selection of pre-fab burgers, sandwiches & salads and multiple sides and appetizers and then a build your own burger option. At first, I couldn't decide what to pick, everything sounded so good. The prices seemed a bit high which made me anticipate a really good burger. That just led to much disappointment. Also, there was a $3 charge to add fries to your sandwich. Typically the burgers were solo in a plastic basket...made me think they'd be huge.

The service was way less than welcoming or friendly with the bar staff in the back bar unhelpful and seemingly annoyed to have to wait on us. Everything I touched seemed sticky and dirty and the stools and table were wobbly. The bathroom was acceptable.

Sodas, ketchup, mustard and mayo along with plastic ware was self serve. They were out of multiple things we tried to order that were on their chalk board menus like ice cream, two different beers on their draft list, the Mountain Dew was empty as was the ketchup dispenser. No one at any time was apologetic for any of these things. 

The burger patties themselves were machine formed if not food service frozen. The meat was under seasoned and WAY over cooked to a dried up charred tasting patty. I wish I would have removed the patty from the bun because I would have enjoyed the rest of the sandwich. The brioche bun was fresh tasting as were the toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. The fresh cut fries were pretty good as was the sloppy Joe meat on the loaded tots. The cheese sauce on the tots was waxy & flavorless. The tots themselves were food service quality and tasted fine. The burger on the donut was tasty, too bad that burger was over cooked, but it was small and hardly had any bacon on it. The burger on French toast with bacon and egg was bland and only saved by the syrup served wth it. That patty was also crispy charred and dry. 

With all the great food options in Cleveland, I really wouldn't bother with this one. I'm sure it is convenient though for the college kids at CSU. Our three small burgers with a side of loaded tots, a side of fries and one fountain drink came to $43. We bought two beers at the bar in the back.",Restaurant

- poor portions that contained 50% fat and bone in the meal
- small drink for a high price 
- long wait time for our dinner which arrived in stages and was not hot
- a policy not to do separate bills
- an automatic addition of 18% for a group
- bland disappointing dishes
- Surprises on the bill (nickel and diming over what comes with your meal and what is extra)

The Margarita on various pages I previously saw was in a margarita glass and looked great. What I actually got was small and disappointing. Not even in a proper glass. $12 for a tiny  drink. I asked the waiter for a proper glass and to his credit, he corrected it but it is disappointing it was necessary to do so. The portion was pretty small compared to other Margaritas I have had.

The beans and rice were not served on our main plate as pictured in other reviews. They arrived on small plates with tiny portions and they were cold. Not appetizing or inspiring. I could have gotten better out of a tin from the grocery store. 

My main was Res En Salsa Verde (Braised Beef) $15. It looks NOTHING like what other reviewer's pictures have been. Luke warm, full of fat and bone. Bland. The server asked how our meals were and I let him know it was bland and fatty. He just said sorry and that it was supposed to be like that. What is the point of asking if you don't take corrective action?

Others ordered the Barbacoa (Lamb) $18 and the Shrimp $?. The Shrimp got a good review. The Barbacoa was okay but not spicy. Unfortunately, an order of guacamole was ordered $9. Small portions and bland. Overall it was felt we could have done better at a fast food burrito place. Wow. That doesn't say much to me. What happened to all the good experiences I read about and some saying it was like home cooking they remember in Mexico? This was not my experience. 

I might have given a slightly higher review but then came the bill. The server indicated they don't split the bill and then agreed to split it among the couples at the table. That turned out badly. People who did not drink and had a small order were given $80 bills and those who did drink and ordered appetizers got the lowest. He claimed all the bills were split evenly but they weren't so we asked for one bill and worked to figure out what we each owed ourselves. That took a long time and ruined the meal. 

We also discovered extra charges for the tortillas even through we had a large table and there was only enough for six of us. He earlier indicated that each meal would come with the tortillas. There were 4 containers and 8 people so seems to me someone didn't get theirs. We had to share and then get charged for extra when we never got what we already paid for. I noticed this occurred in another review and I can confirm this happened again to us. 

Sadly, I cannot recommend this place in good conscience. The interior is nice and the staff are generally friendly. I really wish I could have given a better review. 

Now I await my stomach ache from cold fatty food to settle down.

Update:  I reached out to the restaurant to share my concerns about my experience.  To date, my concerns have gone ignored.  They don't respond to customers.  So much for customer service.",Restaurant

It's all the way in the back of some neighborhood, so it was definitely an unexpected spot (especially with those flashy signs leading the way). Once my boyfriend and I pulled up, we knew this establishment has been here for a veeerry long time. This is a real Ranch, I wouldn't be surprised if they raised their own cattle to serve here. The restaurant is on the left side of the lot and it looks like a few more homes\/buildings on the right side. I apologize if this description is inaccurate, this is more of a nighttime view of the Ranch House. I have no idea what it looks like during the day, but I'm sure the name of the restaurant describes it well...it looks like a Ranch...and it looks like a House. Ta da! 

Now the interior of the restaurant looks like the place should be named Bar Lounge Steakhouse. There were giant flat screens scattered throughout the place, but they were only playing in the bar\/lounge area and not in the restaurant (saving energy?). That was a bit disappointing to my boyfriend, but I don't care to stare at a moving screen while I am eating (even less if I'm really enjoying my food. screw the TV!). 

We were seated by a friendly, sweet waitress who was very informative and helpful throughout the entire meal. We ordered calamari, the rack of lamb for me with Ranch House potatoes, and the prime rib and lobster for the mister with a twice baked potato.  Both of our entrees came with salads and garlic cheese bread. I will now try to switch my review into a more organized and easily read manner:

calamari: good. standard calamari, crispy but oily. appropriate serving size.
salad: I got the house dressing and it was delicious. I cleaned my entire plate, and I don't even like eating my veggies. Bf got ranch dressing on his salad, and he didn't finish it...so I'd say it must have been ok. 
prime rib and lobster: the lobster tail was HUGE!! It just looked so plump and juicy, I did not taste since I'm allergic to shellfish, but my bf seemed happy with it. He reported that the prime rib was good, but he also expressed his regret in not ordering a steak.
rack of lamb: WOW. If you like lamb, you HAVE TO GET THIS. This is the best lamb I have ever had. The herb and dijon blend was PERFECT. I cannot describe this at all, each bite is an explosion and that is an understatement. Usually your first bite is always the best, and then the flavor experience starts winding down. Not with this baby; it's the first bite every single time! 9 perfectly seasoned and fire-grilled chops with meat so tender, I purposely tried using just my lips to pull it off the bone (heeeeY) and it just tore off with no resistance (I got this cooked to medium, btw). Juicy, flavorful, tender...YOU MUST TRY THIS. 
potatoes: sounds like most people are a fan of the twice-baked potato. Bf polished it off his plate, so he must agree. I wish I ordered that, because I did not like my Ranch House potatoes. Basically it's wet hash browns with mushrooms, cheese, and onions in it. Not for me.
Garlic toast: I didn't like it. Too chewy and thin for me (I like the thick, texas toast types) and neither cheesy nor garlic-y enough. My boyfriend liked it though. 

*whew* okay, now that I'm done re-living how awesome my meal was...here's the overall conclusion: definitely try it. You must get lamb if you like it. Everything else is not bad, I think it's a preference thing because there were things I liked that my boyfriend did not and vice versa. Give it a try, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. I'm definitely going back for the lamb.",Restaurant

I first visited them a few months ago and had a really nice experience. Why no review back then? I guess I was feeling hesitant.You see,  I've been bitten by the sophomore slump quite a bit lately - places where the second visit makes the first appear like it wasn't even the same place - and I wanted to make sure Mike's was the real deal. After my second visit I'm happy to report - they are.

Mikes is the kind of place that makes me happy to be an adult. There are some other places that tend to make me feel more like I should be there chaperoning some kids on their first teenage date rather than hanging out with my wife enjoying a quiet dinner and drinks. Not that there's anything wrong with them, it's just that it's nice to have a place where I can hang out with my peeps. You know, the 40+ crowd. Folks like me who are more interested in having an actual conversation with our tablemates than of trying too hard to be hip or score. For me, I think I've found this in Mikes.

Mikes is located just a stone's throw from another of my favorite Berea joints, Cornerstone Brewing Company. I know people throw around the word ""quaint"" when they want to put a positive spin on ""small"", but Mike's really is quaint. The whole place probably doesn't seat more than 30 people, and that's including the bar. That being said, we've never felt crowded in during our visits. It has a homey, warm feel that makes you want to linger a bit longer than you should. 

During our two visits, the service was spot on. During our first visit we sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly, knowledgeable about the beer selection and quick to make sure my beer glass was never empty for long. Our second visit found us seated at a table in the center of the room and the service was just as good. I get so tired of being made to feel like I'm imposing or inconveniencing servers at restaurants. At Mike's the hospitality is so natural you feel like you're at a friends place.

The food at Mike's is definitely more than you'd expect from a small, local tavern. Sure, there's some of the usual suspects - wings, burgers, wraps - but there's also a host of surprising additions like Thai calamari, crispy fried calamari rings tossed in spicy Thai chili sauce and served over noodles, and specials like Croque Madame, a pan fried ham and Swiss cheese sandwich served with a perfectly cooked egg on top. During our most recent visit we enjoyed the mushroom gnocchi and the special French Onion Soup burger (crispy potato sticks, creamy mushroom\/garlic aioli, provolone cheese).

Sure, the food's not perfect. The gnocchi was a bit dense and our burgers haven't exactly been cooked as ordered, but every dish is flavorful, well-seasoned and generously portioned. Another minor annoyance for me was how they had their extensive bottled beer list hand-written on a large board hung high up on the wall next to the bar. It was very difficult to read and made ordering a challenge. They've since added a printed bottles list full of great details, so kudos for that.

Speaking of beer, there's definitely a craft beer bar bent to their selection. They may only have a half dozen or so taps, but each one is filled with a delicious craft beer. I'm not even sure they carry any macros. The bottles list is pretty impressive with probably close to 100 different varieties to choose from. For a beer geek like me, this is a very good thing. During both visits I managed to have several beers I'd never enjoyed before.

Mike's is one of those places that's probably more for the locals than anything else. I'm also pretty sure that's how they want to keep it. While I'm not really local, I'll happily continue to make the short drive from Old Brooklyn. It's probably better that we don't live closer for both our waistline's and pocketbook's sakes. Mike's laid back vibe and surprisingly good food selection (did I mention they've got a great craft beer selection) are definitely two things that will have us coming back very soon.",Restaurant
HnH1V_qipciW87Z2tVxYYw,_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,eLFfWcdb7VkqNyTONksHiQ,2015-08-27,"I've waited a long time for a restaurant opening near Galleria \/ Sunset Station that I can really get excited about. Well, I'm finally excited.

This is Gen Korean BBQ's 12th location, but they're a chain due to its success, not for being ""chain restaurant"" quality. This one is in the Galleria Mall building but not directly connected to the mall. It's near Red Robin and Larsen's, but it's at a higher elevation than Bravo.

I actually ate for free (+tip) due to their public grand opening promo. It fell within dinner hours, which normally costs a very reasonable $19.95 for all you can eat (AYCE). The AYCE lunch is even more affordable at $14.95 and still includes everything except items #7, #8, and #10 (see below).

This may be AYCE, but expect good-quality meats from the kitchen each time you order. Each table is allowed to up to 4 appetizers and 4 meats (8 total) per order. If you have 3-4 people in your group, go for it. But if you're solo or have one companion, don't do this! The time limit is two hours (not flaunted since the place wasn't packed), and you can order as often as you want, so order just a few dishes at a time so that everything is as fresh as possible. On a related note, don't cook all of your meats all at once if you're solo...

Some AYCE KBBQ joints have an employee cook or at least start your order for you, but it's all up to you here, so get familiar with your brown and pink colors really quickly and pick up the tongs and scissors. There are small gas-powered grills no matter if the table seats 2 or 4, and my experience is that meats cook really quickly here. There's plenty of table space for plates even though the grill is prominently fixtured in the table's center, and they will change your grill cover often because ""sticky"" meat residues often coat the grill after a round of cooking.

Time to talk about the food? I think so. The banchan (side dishes) were already at the table, and they included a rather sweet mashed potato salad, kimchi, spicy cucumber, spicy radish, and pickled cucumber. They all complement the meats well at some point, although the potato salad does seem out of place until you get really full. They also bring out a chopped lettuce salad with the first round of orders. The lettuce is fresh, but you can tell that they poured the sweet dressing onto the plated lettuce because a huge pool forms at the bottom.

They have several appetizers, but the only must-order that I've had is the crispy squid legs, with their light crunchy batter and a good salty flavor. The KFC was a large portion of fried boneless chicken pieces with sweet and spicy sauce. I'd skip it in favor of proper meat texture here, which the sesame chicken does have. The seaweed salad and agedashi tofu are both pretty good. The popcorn shrimp and pork katsu are fun but not thematically consistent. The japchae is a good complement to any meat, but Gen's version seems a little harder and less silky than another delicious japchae that I recently ate across town.

I got a bunch of grilled meats, listed as follows: 

#3 Gen chadol (beef brisket) is thinly sliced and comes in a relatively large portion. It's tasty and has the ""beefiest"" flavor.

#5 Gen beef bulgogi also is largely portioned. It's nicely marinated and ends up tender after cooking, but it's a little messy to lay flat on the grill and flip. It's well worth it though.

#7 Roast beef (premium beef chuck rib eye) comes in just 4-5 thin slices and cooks really, really quickly. Maybe 8 seconds at most on each side will suffice. The marbling really comes out in the great flavor and soft texture.

#8 Premium beef tongue is around 5 rolled-up thin slices per order. Like the roast beef, it cooks really quickly. Another item with great flavor and tenderness, assuming no overcooking...

#10 Gen yangyum galbisal, aka marinated premium steak, is about 5 squarish cuts per order. It's a boneless version of the popular short ribs. It was tender and well-flavored, and was a multiple reorder on my second visit.

#15 Spicy pork bulgogi is also fine, and it's mild-medium at best. It's good but not special.

#17 Smoked garlic pork belly and #19 Miso pork belly both come in two large, thick strips. Cut them up after cooking. The smoky flavor was a little unusual and perhaps should be left to the American BBQ context, but I enjoyed the miso version.

#20 Shrimp and #21 Cajun Shrimp were both good, shell-on shrimp, 4 per order.

The sweet dipping sauce and the salt and pepper mix are both useful for the non-marinated meats.

Service issues seem to be a theme with new Gen openings, including the recent one in San Jose. Luckily, they were fairly minimal for me, with an average of 1.5 forgotten requests (all corrected after prompting). As I mentioned above, the restaurant wasn't full, so I didn't experience much slowness in order fulfillment.

Overall, you'll find a delicious and worthwhile meal even at the regular price. I'll most likely be back soon for more meat gluttony.",Restaurant
cGSKJAQZtXgK8l4O23hP5A,hi7Ont22x3kGZ7R0i7ChPg,2BuY5r2GWoai6IAn9FptCg,2013-04-30,"Aria's spa is the place, ideally,
if you want to spa with your boyfriend, freely.
Coed jacuzzi, get touchy-feely,
That's the point of this spa, really.

Yep. Aria's the place to go if you want to hit the spa with your opposite-gender friend.

I usually opt for Qua at Caesar's for my Vegas spa needs, and would recommend Qua over Aria if you are going alone or with one or two same-sex friends. But this time I decided to switch it up and try the Aria, because, for once, I was actually in Vegas with a dude-friend who wanted to spa it up with me.

Aria, if you do your research, has a couple of relatively unique features, namely a few coed areas (including an outdoor jacuzzi which overlooks one of the Aria pools), as well as an option (if each guest is having at least 2 50-minute services) to pay $40 an hour for a private spa suite.

We availed ourselves of both. The spa suite was great; photos do not do it justice. I enjoyed the VIP service that comes with that, for a relatively low price on top of the services ($160 for 4 hours, plus tip for your VIP host). 

The spa suite included:
- a shower\/locker\/get ready room with a small eucalyptus steam sauna
- an area with tables for services
- a living room area with television, couches & coffee table, and private fridge with beverages as well as hot tea maker
- a private jacuzzi 

The bath was cold when we arrived, which was a problem - our host started running the hot water and said it should heat up quickly, but we had to call her back when it became obvious that it was not making a dent. We drained the tub 2\/3 of the way and refilled it while we were having our side-by-side reflexology and massages.

The massage, for me, was one of the best I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of massages (I've been seeing the same massage therapist for about 3-4 years now). I had been to Disneyland a couple of days prior, and my quads were extremely tight from all the walking. My therapist at Aria honed in on that very quickly; it was impressive. He also did something with his arm across my spine and outward toward my shoulders that nobody has ever done before. Awesome.

One of the cooler things about the spa suite was also that we were able to order lunch from the hotel's room service menu and have it delivered there. Salads, a hot bath for two, CNN... we were happy campers. 

After the spa suite, I have to say, the service declined pretty rapidly. Already enrobed, I grabbed my clothes and headed upstairs to the main spa. I had to wait quite a while for someone to come along and assign me a locker - so long, in fact, that I gave up and went to grab some spa water while waiting. While I was doing that, of course, another patron walked up and that's when an attendant decided to show up. So she ends up giving this other patron the whole spa tour while I'm still standing there holding my clothes. Urgh.

My suggestion would be for the VIP spa hosts to help with the transition into the regular spa, at least as far as getting a locker and taking your things upstairs.

Once that was all over, though, things improved rapidly again: I enjoyed the peaceful vibrations of the salt room while my companion went back to the Bellagio to retrieve a swimsuit. Upon his return, we probably spent the better part of an hour, maybe 2, enjoying the heck out of the outdoor jacuzzi together. On a Tuesday afternoon, there were only 4 people out there, including us. 

If I go back with a suitable companion, I think I'll definitely be availing myself of all these things again. I'd love to go in winter, when that jacuzzi will be open during sunset and the evening hours. 

I'd give the whole thing 5 stars if it weren't for the bad service at the upstairs spa desk. Overall, if you're like me and looking for the best coed spa experience, I'd recommend Aria.",Beauty
yB4Q0jKweRqNQLAHu2ZyCQ,Jt1zgNmwz_jheOSmEsljPQ,MLQeuiL9rqOq_rDKGEcU0A,2011-11-16,"I came here with Mel C and another friend to try F'Amelia's pumpkin menu items (there was a pasta and a dessert). Honestly, I don't even think I love pumpkin that much, but Mel C has brainwashed me into thinking that I do. And of course, free parking around the neighbourhood is always a bonus! 

The decor was rustic and charming, reminicsent of a cozy traditional Italian kitchen. I would love to dine here during the day, when sunlight can flood into the room.

We started off with two kinds of bread, served with olive oil. We all particularly loved the flatbread, which was reminiscent of pizza dough. Lucky that the bread was not served individually and not by the basket. Otherwise I would've eaten a lot more of it. 

Now onto the food:

Pumpkin gnocchi with brown butter and sage, topped with amaretti crumble. The gnocchi had a really nice texture- soft and pillowy, just the way I like it. I could definitely taste the pumpkin, but I would've liked a little more of it. What I found strange was the sweetness of the dish. I expected a savoury pasta, but instead, the flavour combination was closer to the dessert end, particularly with the addition of amaretti crumble. However, the dish was undoubtedly unique, and I don't regret my choice.

Crespelle stuffed with prosciutto, 1608 cheese and spinach. This was my favourite of the night! The pasta was so soft that it seemingly fused with the cheese. The whole time, I felt like I was eating ham and spinach au gratin. The cheese was rich, creamy and absolutely delicious! The portion looks small, but the abundance of cheese made it very filling.  

We bullied our other friend James into ordering a pizza, and he went with our server's recommendation- Di Parma with fior di latte, tomato sauce, prosciutto di Parma D.O.P., and extra virgin olive oil. I had a small slice and enjoyed it. The crust was very thin, which I liked. 

Desserts...

Brûlée pumpkin tart with lavender chantilly cream. I found the lavendar bizarre and interesting, but luckily, it was quite subtle and not overwhelming. I wasn't overly impressed with the tart because the pastry was too thick and dry. With tarts, I really prefer the rustic ones that are more gooey and buttery.

F'Amelia offers a foursquare sign-in special in which you can get your second dessert 50% off. With that in mind, we coerced James into ordering a dessert as well (we're just wonderful friends!). He went with a more innovative dessert- wood oven baked apple and cinnamon pizza with vanilla ice cream. I love the concept of a dessert pizza, even though I didn't love the actual execution. There was just too much dough, and I'm not sure I want to be eating more carbs for dessert after indulging in a meal of bread, pasta and pizza. I also found it to be a little dry overall. Maybe adding more of that delicious vanilla ice cream would have helped. A word of warning: this dessert pizza is huge! I definitely recommend sharing this between at least 4 people if you don't want to be stuffed. 

Despite the slightly disappointing desserts, I quite enjoyed our meal as a whole at F'Amelia. The menu changes seasonally, so I would definitely come back and try other items in the future. All in all, it's a great place for a cozy, heartwarming meal.",Restaurant
opjDmqbOyQHr7Q94Vco1zg,0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,jivUZsWa3jg5_0fD_cci_w,2011-09-29,"I am smitten with this hotel!  It takes me around a hundred hours of browsing hotel reviews and making sure the one I choose is priced well, clean, safe, and quiet - before I click purchase.  

The reviews for Le St. Martin were consistently strong throughout every review and travel site, and now I know for myself, exactly why.

First off, I got a fantastic deal through hotels.com, and used a coupon code from retailmenot for an additional 10% off.  

Second, this hotel is in an excellent location if you are visiting Montreal and want to see all of the main attractions.  If not within decent walking distance, you can hop on the Peel Station metro (which is literally, a skip away..   One block down, but the block is SMALL and extremely safe), and it gives you the green line which takes you to other stations if you need to get on the Orange line..  and that is only a few metro stops itself) - or take the bus from the corner of Maisonneuve and McGill.  Rue McGill is a block down.  

From the airport, you can the 747 bus that drops you off a couple of blocks south of Maisonneuve, on the corner of Rene Levesque and Peel.  It's the same way back to the airport.  You can purchase a daily metro card from the airport for $7 (or was it $8?), and you're good for 24 hours from the moment you scan it on the bus.  I ended up buying a 3 day pass later on, but that's another story.  Anyway, it's about a 25 min or so ride to\/from the airport, and both times I was around rush hour.  

When you arrive in the hotel lobby, you're greeted by very welcoming bell hops and reception desk.  It's a small lobby, but very pristine, and there's a fireplace to the corner - and the bar\/bistro behind.  I had no issues checking in.  I like that your room card\/key is also what allows you to click on your floor level whilst on the elevator.  For example, if you are on the 10th floor, you swipe your key\/card and then the ""10"" will activate if you click it.  No other floor will.  An excellent addition to safety.

I had paid in full prior to arriving, so it was a simple few moments and I was off to my room.  The hallways have speakers\/music which is quite nice during the day, but it's on 24 hours.  I'd suggest they turn it off between 11pm and 6am, because it can slightly be heard in the room, especially if it's a song with strong instrumentals! :)  I'm a light sleeper, so this probably wouldn't concern others much.

You walk into the room, and greeted with a decent amount of walking space, an immaculately clean and modern bathroom (granite countertop, a wood vanity with open shelving underneath, a large shower, and overall a very spacious bathroom).  The shower has wooden blinds on the other side of the glass, leading towards the bedroom itself, and they can be shut for privacy if need be.  I was on my own and so there was not any matter over that.  They provide you with lots of fresh towels, and also a bath robe and bath slippers in the closet!  The toiletries they provide are from Italy.  I did not ever hear of the brand, but the bar soaps smell nice.  The rest are a tad strong\/masculine.

The bedroom itself is spacious, and I had a nice view of Maisonneuve, although I was high up (which I wanted).  My room was with one king bed and perfectly wide and comfortable.  The only issue for me was that something in the room or from the springs in the bed, made a light clicking noise all night.  Actually the other issue was that the bed was not 100% comfortable.  Don't get me wrong, it's a new and clean bed, but not the best sleep I've had in a hotel.  The pillows are abundant, and I believe they could be down-filled, as they sounded a bit crunchy.  You get four pillows with the King, two standard and two long ones.  Again, not the most comfy, but that's just my own preference, because the quality seemed great.  

The room also has a work desk and chair, and it's extremely convenient that the outlet for the power cord, and everything else, is in a compartment *on* the desk, rather than under the desk against the wall.

They leave you with two complimentary water bottles on your bedside table.  The wine and everything else in plain view, has a fee.  The TV is an LCD, although I probably only turned it on once for the weather.  

For those who may want this information: There is a floor to length mirror, a closet with hangers, iron\/board, hairdryer, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower cap, Keurig coffee machine and coffee, bath robe, slippers, towels galore, great pressure showerhead (stand up shower, not a bathtub in this room), black-out curtains, water, and oh.. FREE WIFI!  That is always a plus, as not all hotels will offer this.  It's also very easy to connect to.  It requires two pieces of simple information and you're logged in for 24 hours and just need to re-login each day of your stay. 

Service:  You won't find better!  Daily housekeeping and meticulously clean.  Staying here again, for sure!",Restaurant

I also know a good massage when I get one and I did not get one here. I spent $150 on a 80 minute Swedish massage and they added a $30 service charge to it which is unbelievable considering I feel like that was not earned. I am all for paying a service charge because the spas in Vegas charge them and I typically tip on top of that but this time I did not. That service charge was more than enough! Ok time to break this down for you. 

Front desk (check in):
Ok this place was off to a bad start because of the experience with checking in. I had an appointment and I arrived an hour beforehand because I planned on enjoying the spa a little before my massage. I arrive and the lady behind the desk is already helping someone. Well what was going on here is he was looking for his wife who I guess was in the spa area. I am standing there waiting and she is dealing with this guy and apparently someone else had already gone to the back to look for his wife. So if that's the case why couldn't he step aside and allow me to be checked in. He was already being helped and this was taking a while so I found it a little annoying. Then she finally acknowledges me and has him step aside so I can be checked in. She gives me a form to fill out and then walks off. I fill out the form and I am left standing there. Another girl comes out and tells the man his wife had already cause she was not back there. She then asks me if I need help and I gave her the form and she checked me in. That took way too long to get started. 

The Spa:
So disappointing! The Luxor has a badass theme to work with and they could have made you feel like Cleopatra or something by having a kick ass spa. Caesar's Palace spa has the Roman Baths so I had thought they might do something like that. The customer service in that area was not that great either. I walked in and I was not greeted.  I was given a locker and a key. I had sandals on already so they did not offer me any. No matter I guess. I was not given a tour or anything so I guess it is good the place is small. The only thing she showed me is where the lockers were. The spa has nothing. Two very small tubs, a sauna, and a steamroom. Nothing else. No cold plunge and the water temps in both spas were too hot. No warm relaxing water spa like the other ones I have been to. Steamroom and Sauna were unimpressive. The only thing this place has going for it is the relaxation area and the juice and fruit they offer. The chairs there were very comfy and they had TV to keep you entertained. I spent most of my time there. 

The Massage:
Another disappointment. I went in for an 80 minute Swedish massage. I ended up getting an 80 minute deep tissue on steroids. It hurt!!! Swedish massages are light to medium pressure and are not meant to hurt. I have had alot of those in my lifetime. The masseuse's name was Kristin and she was rude. No other way to say it. She explained what a Swedish massage was and her words were it is a light to medium pressure full body massage. She also said if she was going too hard or too soft to let her know. Well while she was murdering my neck, back and arms I let her know it was too hard and she got a huge attitude with me about it which shocked me. When I said it was too hard she sighed hella loud and said ""ok uh huh."" After that it was extremely uncomfortable because I think I seriously made her mad. You could cut the tension with a knife. What made it worse is when she was doing my legs she started to hurt me again to the point to where I was wincing so I reluctantly said something again and same reaction. I was so uncomfortable after that. I'm sorry but if I am paying $180 for a massage then I think you should make me comfortable and use the pressure I like without complaint. She was so unprofessional. The one thing she did do well and it felt great was she massaged my face and scalp. The face massage made me melt. It felt amazing and the scalp massage was great too. The rest of it sucked and hurt like hell. I have had deep tissue massages that did not hurt nearly as bad. She made me so uncomfortable because of her reaction that I spent the entire time tense. Let's just say this is why I did not tip on top of the service charge. It was not deserved. Once we were done and I got dressed she walked me back and did not even say goodbye to me or have a nice day or thank you or anything. I only mention that because at other spas they were more polite. 

Check out:
I just wanted out. I got dressed turned in my key and went to the front and paid and left. Check out was quick thank goodness. 

Bottom line I would not come here again even if I got comped. There are WAY too many spas in Vegas where I can spend the same amount of money and have a much better experience and enjoy much better facilities. This place is j",Beauty

She completely ignored it and insisted repeatedly that I needed to adjust my WORK schedule and make another appointment for her to fix it at a time and on a day that was convenient for her.  When I continued to demand a refund she started blowing up my phone with texts trying to argue that her stylist had given me a full consultation before I ever even sat in her chair which was a bald faced lie because I'd been in the bathroom when she decided she was ready for me so my husband had showed the stylist the video and when I came out of the bathroom and asked if she saw the video she said yep and told me to have a seat.  She did tell me she couldn't do what was in the video but she was literally half-way done slapping bleach on my hair as she was issuing the warning.

I continued to insist on a refund and the salon manager (Sheila) continued to ignore the request and try to argue with me.  Eventually she offered me the salon owner's number and when I accepted that offer she just stopped texting me altogether.  The next morning I decided I had no choice but to go in, when my friend and I arrived Sheila wasn't in yet and the woman who came to the counter took attitude immediately.  My friend was nicely trying to explain the circumstance and I was letting her do all the talking because I was too upset to be nice.  The stylist immediately cut her off mid-sentence with ""Is this the woman that's been talking to Sheila?""  My friend said yes and we were told Sheila wasn't in yet and to come back in 15 minutes so we went next door to Sally's to kill some time.  When we returned Sheila was at the counter, counting the drawer so we waited quietly by the door for her to finish.

Suddenly she slapped a stack of cash down on the counter hard and snapped ""there's your refund!"" in the most unprofessional way possible.  There was a client behind her and the client even turned to look like she couldn't believe the attitude Sheila was throwing around when neither my friend nor I had said a single word since returning to the salon.  I asked for a receipt from my original visit because my husband said he was never given one and Sheila at first said she didn't have one, then she printed it off and handed it to my friend.  My friend and I turned to leave and Sheila decided she couldn't just leave it at that and let us go without throwing around some more attitude so as we're half-way through the door she adds ""Just so you know, Guy Tang colors cost $800-$1,000 so for you to come in here expecting to pay $100...""

Let's be clear.  I walked into this exact salon a month before my appointment and asked the stylist (a small girl with dark funky colored hair, if memory serves) if anyone there could do what I wanted and how much it would cost so I could save up for it.  She played with my hair a little and quoted me about $200.  I saved up and had $300 cash in my pocket when I entered the salon for my appointment.  I did not go into that salon ""expecting to pay $100"".  As I was trying to tell her that she just started shouting ""bye keyboard warrior"" at me over and over, causing the customer in the back of the salon to gape at the back of her head in complete shock and disgust.  

As a salon manager, Sheila's behavior was DEPLORABLE and I never did get the owner's number that she offered to give me so I hope he reads his reviews because he needs to know that his salon manager acts like a petulant child.  We were prepared to leave without a big scene, refund in hand, the door to the salon was wide open, and I was half-way outside with my friend right behind me.  She could have kept her mouth shut and that would have been the end of it but she couldn't resist trying to throw her giant attitude around the shop one more time.  Her behavior is completely unacceptable in a business environment and most salons wouldn't put up with her as a stylist, let alone a salon manager.  She does messy, sloppy work and she allows the stylists to do messy sloppy work.  As my friend and I were finally walking out of her store she started blowing up my friend's phone with text messages which is completely unprofessional and unacceptable - bordering on harassment.  She has the customer service skills of a rhinoceros and the maturity level of toddler.  She's going to get this salon into a lawsuit one of these days if they don't deal with her because I had plenty of grounds to sue and to go to the Department of Consumer Affairs and the Better Business Bureau after what this salon did and how Sheila behaved.  She has no business managing anything.

Also of note, while I was in the salon getting my hair done before my first review there was a young girl (13-14) sitting in the waiting area when I arrived.  All three of the stylists left her sitting there and took one walk-in after another, making her wait for over 2 hours for a simple trim!",Beauty
yeLdtemsQsK-DuR0ix5S6A,1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,KhjE3xEiUlqJwtJ6R0WwBg,2017-02-09,"High end shop with moderate prices!  As good as it gets!  This boutique owners, Ido (pronounced 'E-doh') and his wife Ronit (pronounced 'Rone-neat'), are wonderful people, honest dealing, and provide such excellent service that you build a life-long relationship with them for all your jewelry needs compared to a typical transaction\/negotiation.

Perks:
1) You deal with Ido or Ronit only.  It's a concierge service model rather than a shark tank in your standard shopping center jewelry store with a cars-dealer type of salespeople.  

2) By appointment only and total privacy.  You \/ Your guests will be the only ones in their business office.  You get 100% of their attention.  Spend as much time as you need to ask questions and look through the pieces.

3) All gems here are certified to be conflict free - No blood diamonds here.

4) Appraisal (and certificate) from a GIA approved lab are included - There is no room for question regarding your jewelry's value, quality, or authenticity since each stone has laser inscribed ID (invisible to the naked eye but can be seen under technical instruments).  This made it very easy and saved us a ton of money \/ work to add it to the home owner's insurance policy.  

5) Lifetime fair value trade in - When you buy here, the value you paid is the value you get on your trade in.  You don't have to worry about losing value as with other jewelry stores.  

6) Complimentary cleaning and inspections - It's like the oil change and engine check except it comes with the ultimate car wash and wax to keep your jewelry looking new.  Ido also inspects the settings for normal wear and tear to make sure that your stones are not lose.  I have on occasion knocked my ring into a granite counter or wall corners by accident so this is one of my most used services ;)

7) If you're the creative type or have your heart set on a design, they can do it here.  I referred a friend who brought in a magazine ad and had Ido and Ronit make her the jewelry piece with high quality stones for a 1\/3 of the retail price of the unnamed store that rhymes with Spiffany.

8) Redesign old jewelry here - Rather than let valuable jewelry (inherited especially) sit in a drawer, rework it so you'll wear it every day.  I've also brought in my MIL's jewelry for redesign as she's getting older and losing dexterity.

Our story:
A few years ago, husband complimented a pair of newly engaged friend's engagement ring and did the bro talk to try to find out how many months of salary did our friend have to save up for the ring.  Surprisingly, our friend could not stop talking about what a deal they got on it in addition to it being a stress free experience.  Our friend even shopped around town at a few places and researched the value online and told us that it's an unbeatable price for the quality.  

A few months later, our friend invited us to a Wine & Cheese client appreciation event at The Perfect Princess Cut for clients and their guests.  At the event, we met and spoke with Ido & Ronit along with many more couples and families who had purchased and got to know their story and experiences of working with The Perfect Princess Cut.  We also saw the quality and design of the pieces they had purchased here as most people wore their jewelry to the event.  We had no doubt in our mind that we'd be working with Ido and Ronit when our time is right, except what I didn't know is that my husband actually had eyes and ears at the showroom to pay attention to which pieces I picked up and tried on because he was getting ready to propose!  (I was clueless).  Husband and Ido worked together to create a unique design based on two rings that I tried on and said 'Wow', 'so pretty', and 'omg'. 

I get tons of compliments on my ring's design everywhere we go.  The best part is when it came time to do the wedding band, Ido had band custom made to fit perfectly against my engagement ring's setting.  Husband picked out a tungsten (scratch resistant) band and we both had the inside of our bands inscribed after providing it to Ido with the inscription.  Tricky part was, we did it in 2 foreign languages and Ido sourced artists in the country to get it done.  It was a totally stress-free one stop shop experience.  

We have since purchased necklaces, studs, and bracelets from The Perfect Princess Cut and have referred all our friends and family to come here before they look anywhere else because of the incredible price (almost wholesale!), quality, service model, and knowing that we can trust Ido and Ronit to deal with us fairly and take care of people we care about.  My mom and sister in law have both bought diamond studs here too after accompanying me on my trip where I picked out stones for my earrings.  They couldn't believe the price for the quality of the stones.

I hope this is helpful to you if you're trying to find a trustworthy, high quality, and best value jewelry for a purchase!  Feel free to PM me if I can answer any questions.",Shopping
PV1JO4bwhv8uQWhVDXHHWw,9DaTeFnTzSZmsAdbMJzFBw,WGfalBzV-u0gXKb6149ZCQ,2009-06-30,"Be warned: this place hasn't updated their store hours. My girlfriend and I went on a Sunday looking for one last place to eat before I would have to leave Arizona and the store sign said they weren't open until 12pm, when in fact, they actually opened at 11am. We only found out of their actual business hours by calling the restaurant and by then we had spent almost an hour waiting at a Del Taco across the street eating $.57 tacos. Agh. 

Getting into the restaurant, surprisingly, was the least pleasant aspect of the trip. Once we were inside, we were greeted by Marley, one of the waitresses. She was extremely nice and did a great job of making us feel welcomed and was very attentive to possible dietary restrictions - such as veganism(she pointed out which dishes had yogurt in them and provided possible alternatives). 

My girlfriend and I, despite already being half satiated from Del Taco, were enticed enough by the menu selection to go ahead and order more than a full meal. We got:

1. Potato and Collard Sambussas - The skin was thinner than most sambussas I've had(which isn't a bad thing - in fact, I enjoyed it very much) which, as a result, gave the sambussa a very nice crispy outer layer. The filling was on the milder side but went very well with the spiced yogurt sauce that was provided for dipping. 

2. Vegetable Combo\/Platter -
 - Eggplant - It's a bit tangy and some bites didn't taste like eggplant
 - Red Lentils - Surprisingly sweet - I definitely enjoyed it
 - Yellow Split Peas - This dish was also more on the sweet side - enjoyable
 - Collard Greens - Not bad but not great - more spices please!
 - Spiced Chickpeas - Probably the most spiced dish we got which is a good thing

My main complaint is that the dishes were far too mild for my taste. I wish they had more spice! 

The restaurant, on certain days of the week(only two, I think Wednesday and Sunday?), offers a special raw foods menu. Like most raw foods, it's definitely on the pricey side and portions take a noticeable cut. We got two desserts:

Banana Ice Cream Sundae - The ice cream was nice and refreshing - not overly sweet though at times I felt like we were just eating mashed up frozen banana. The raw chocolate sauce was the real star. It has a very distinct nutty taste that chocolate syrup normally doesn't have. I can see how it is probably a hate-it-or-love-it kind of thing but I absolutely enjoyed the sauce. 

Chai Custard - This was my favorite dish here. Too bad I didn't have enough room to finish it. The texture was incredibly smooth and provided wonderful tactile sensations to my tongue as I ate it. No one spice was overpowering and I could taste all the different spices in the custard(cardamom, chai, cinnamon). Definitely a must try.  

The prices for the food were decent. It was $8.95 for the vegetarian platter which came with a good amount of injera - we definitely left stuffed. The raw foods, on the other hand, are much pricier. The custard itself was $7 - almost the cost of the entire vegetarian platter. 

This restaurant would be great for people with low tolerance to spicy food, but for me, I prefer a lot more kick in my food.",Restaurant
Ox9KQEqO_EM_vLDDJxBpHQ,Up5reJmuM7a4lMz46KhngA,gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg,2011-07-11,"This family runs a great business! For the Phoenix area, they run a very clean, inexpensive, and certainly authentic Vietnamese dining experience. Don't throw them under the bus and compare them to some of the greats in Orange County or San Fran, those places are in a league of their own. :) 

Thanh himself, is a young guy, whom you will usually find seating you when you visit the restaurant. His parents do much of the cooking and other work in the restaurant. 

Everything that I have tried so far in this place has been great! The Cafe Sua Da is brewed fresh in a cup at your table while you eat your meal, which is nice, as many of these places have begun to serve pre-made Cafe Sua da. If you aren't familiar with what I am speaking of, it's a very strong coffee that is brewed by the cup and then poured over condensed milk, stirred, then poured into a glass of ice and stirred once more. You won't mess with Starbucks after trying this brew. It's simple, strong, and has a nice kick, along with some anti-oxidizing effects. ;) 

The simple, but classic Pho Thai, which consists of Rice Noodles, Pho Stock, and Thin slices of beef that are placed in the Pho bowl just as they are served, is flavorful and great for a newcomer to the Vietnamese Cuisine. It is accompanied with the typical plate of condiments, which you can add to your own discretion and liking. The plate includes the following fresh items: Bean Sprouts, Fresh Basil Leaves, Lime, Jalapeno Slices, and Mint Leaves. A good Pho, won't require adding Sriracha or any other sauces to the Pho itself. Don't be a NOOB and do this. Mix your Sriracha or Chili Oil with Hoison Sauce in the little sauce dish at the table and dip your beef in it before eating. If you like onions, order Hanh Dam with your dish. It's sliced onions in rice vinegar, be sure to spice them up with Sriracha when they bring them to your table, and eat them along with the beef or a bite of your Pho, it's a great addition to your meal. 

The broken rice dishes that I have tried have been great as well. Broken rice, is simply that, Rice that has been broken in half by a special machine. It really changes the texture of the rice in a good way. The Pork Chop that I had with mine was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It was served with a fried egg, bean curd wrapped shrimp cake, shredded pork skin, and some grilled shrimp. For less than $7.00, its better than one of those secret steak and shrimp meals that you will find in some of the Vegas Casino's, and will fill you up for sure. Be sure to use the fish sauce to drizzle on your meal. Don't smell it, just add a little chili oil, and drizzle it over your dish. I use the whole bowl, it adds so much great flavor to the dish. 

The Spring Rolls were the standard with Pork and Shrimp inside, and served with the Peanut Sauce. Be sure to add a little Chili Oil to the sauce before dipping. 

The Egg rolls, which will be ordered by most white people were great as well. It's difficult to screw up fried foods. Be sure that you wrap the egg rolls in the lettuce and add some mint leaves to the wrap before dipping in the fish sauce that you hopefully added a little chili oil to. 

The Fresh Coconut Water is served proper, in a freshly cracked coconut. You get the whole thing as you should, whereas some of these places around here will just serve you a small glass along with some of the meat from the coconut inside. 

They also serve the Vietnamese Sandwiches here, which I recommend. The BBQ Pork is probably the best one, served on a fresh french roll with Cilantro, Carrots, Jalapeno, and Cucumber. For $2.50, you can't beat it. You can actually take these home and throw them in the refrigerator for later.

Thanh himself usually clears and cleans the tables immediately after someone leaves. The service here has always been great, and very quick, considering that the place is usually full everyday at lunch time.

If you are new to Vietnamese Cuisine, I highly recommend Pho Thanh. Be brave, and try new things, you have no idea what you are missing. They don't serve anything odd, and if it didn't taste good, then it wouldn't be on the menu, so don't be so white, and give it a try. You will love it, I promise! :)",Restaurant

The burritos are big, the food is dependable, it's easy to customize, and things are surprisingly tasty for being a subsidiary of McDonald's. The reason this review gets one star is the horrible customer service and a fairly major flub on their part. 

This location is fairly busy, so I placed my order online so I could just go in and pick it up. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and chips & guac. Started with some chips, then moved on to my burrito. Took a bite and got a mouthful of chicken - not so pleasant when you order a VEGETARIAN burrito. 

Now, I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not a super-big fan of meat, especially when I'm not expecting it to be there. If I was a vegetarian, I'd have been pissed. The receipt said veg and the wrapper had my name written on it, so I should have been reasonably confident that my burrito was not going to contain meat. I'm fairly easy-going, so if my burrito had otherwise been what I ordered, I would have just sucked it up and gone with it - I'd already driven there once. Unfortunately, it wasn't - whatever combination of fillings they put in the burrito was really unappealing to me.

My unexpected meaty mouthful put me off my appetite for a burrito, so I decided to just finish my order of chips & guac and call it a day. I was meeting friends shortly and I didn't have time to drive back to Chipotle, wait in line while they made me another burrito, then eat. I needed to gas up the car, so I decided I'd just bring the burrito back for a refund and go to the gas station across the street. 

Upon my return, I went up to the register and explained to the cashier what happened. She was very apologetic and did her best to help me out - five stars for her. She went in the back to talk to the manager, and came back to offer to remake the burrito correctly since chicken and veggie burritos cost the same. I politely told her no thank you, and that I just wanted my money back. She disappeared into the back again, and came back to tell me the manager would be out in a minute. By the time the manager finally came out front, about 15 minutes had passed since I first talked to the cashier. This should have been a quick in and out. 

While at the register, the manager completely ignored me. Literally. No eye contact. I had expected her to ask me why I was returning my food and maybe offer in some way to ""make it right"" - at the very least an apology and maybe something more along the lines of a coupon\/free drink\/etc, seeing as how I had to come in twice, she kept me waiting forever, and, you know, I had been served meat in a vegetarian entree. 

Nope. She didn't say a single word to me and didn't so much as give me a glance. She inspected my burrito to make sure I wasn't making it up, fumbled with the cash register for a few minutes, then handed me my cash with a ""thank you"" and walked away - all very huffy and like it was a huge burden for her to push a few buttons on the cash register. 

There is no shortage of burrito places in town, including other Chipotle locations, so I doubt I'll be motivated to come back to this particular location ever again.",Restaurant
RYPDeKTWnDUoieQBQJ71Ug,GTFnwya4c77RFyHTQXhZFA,wGbKeTj8B-UbqCywlKSuqA,2017-05-10,"Hair Color Xperts is a  business that I hope will soon be exposed and shut down for their business ethics and poor customer service. I sent my girlfriend there to get her hair colored as a gift for her new print ad contract she signed the day before. I provided a payment of $220 so they could color her hair the way she needed it to be colored for her upcoming shoot. 

She provided hair color Xperts (HCX) with a photo of what color she needed her hair to be. The beautician Adriana saw this photo and agreed and assured us that she could perform the task of coloring my girlfriends hair the color that was displayed in the photo so of course we believed her, so we agreed to proceed with the treatment. 

Her appointment was set and we were ready to drive from Henderson to the North Buffalo area Las Vegas (35 minute drive) but 30 minutes before departure HCX called to reschedule the appointment to a later time. (Although inconvenient) we waited until the new time Adriana gave us and proceeded with traveling to HCX. Once arrived, Adriana was an additional 45 minutes late. (This should've been the first red flag) but we understood that things happen out of our control and sometimes time commitments change due to unforeseen circumstances. 

4.5 very long hours and $220 later she finished and to our surprise her hair was a complete fiasco. It wasn't even remotely close to what she'd asked for but we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and decided to wait a day to see if the color would change......it didn't. It was still a mess and we had to go to LA for a photo shoot that NOW she can't attend because the hair isn't what she wanted. 

We called to express our dissatisfaction and spoke to a guy who called himself the owner. His name is Andy, and he was the most unprofessional business owner I had ever spoken to at that moment. We simply asked for a full refund so that she can go to another salon and fix what HCX had ruined. Andy suggested that she come back to HCX and allow them the chance to ""touch up the roots"" when it was not only the roots that was the problem, it was the ENTIRE head of hair! This would only do further damage to her hair seeing as it had JUST been bleached. We did not take his offer (for obvious reasons) and he stated that it was the only thing he could do to remedy the horrible hair job that Adriana performed. Andy refused to refund my money and his reasoning was that he had been conned by previous customers into giving a full refund and it didn't work out. I didn't understand how he could apply that same mentality to our situation where the job they performed was a total failure. In addition, we sent photos of her hair as proof whereas he AGREED it wasn't a good job. There clearly wouldn't be any conning going on from us but in actuality we were the ones being robbed by the HCX business and Andy. 

A day went by and we spoke to Andy about a possible resolution. Andy suggested that he refund only $150 and that we return to HCX to fix her hair and to promise him that we wouldn't leave a review about our experience at HCX. We hesitantly verbally agreed to these terms, So we let Andy know that we would be coming to HCX that day to receive the $150 (our plan was to simply retrieve our funds and we would refuse the services) again for obvious reasons. 

Prior to writing this review I noticed that other negative reviews stated that they too were bribed with money and or services to not leave a negative review or to update their reviews to make HCX appear satisfactory when indeed this was clearly not the case. 

Less than an hour later we were contacted by Maria who also claimed to be the owner of HCX and after further investigation it turns out she is the actual owner of HCX. Maria told us that if we were to appear at HCX to retrieve the agreed upon refund and service that she would call the local police to escort us from the premises. 
Needless to say, I will be taking matters further with this situation and I do not recommend going to the hair salon as they show zero compassion for their customers and they continue to bribe by paying clients not to leave negative reviews of HCX. To this very day they have not taken responsibility for their wrongdoing. 
The FACT is that when someone comes into a hair salon and asks to have their hair a certain way, your salon representatives (beautician, stylist, owner, manager etc...) is being trusted to make an educated observation and inform the client wether they are able to accomplish the task or if they simply cannot. HCX ""greedily"" told us they could do the job we asked for and they not only failed miserably in accomplishing the actual task but to make matters worse, their customer service was absolutely unacceptable, inconsiderate, rude and unethical.",Beauty

I purchased the Groupon deal for two people which was 30 minute foot scrub, 60 minute ""signature collagen"" facial with some specific skin care line, 60 minute massage with  body butter and your choice of aromatherpy, beverages and pastries and then 10% off the skin care line. So, first off, getting in contact to make an appointment was a hassle. I could not get anyone to answer the business phone and their voicemail was full so I could not leave a message. On Groupon the owner posted an alternate number to contact him, so I called a few times and left messages but did not get a call back. After a few days I finally was able to reach Jimmy and set an appointment. He had some b.s. excuse about the phone not being able to handle the call volume, blah, blah. An excuse that I really did not care about and I feel a professional business would not be hiding behind. 

I decide to use the services for my Mom and I for a Mother's Day spa-venture. It is a day we will never forget; however, it will be because it was so out of this world terrible. The pictures online are NOT what the place looks like...maybe it's the old location, but not the new. We walk in and there are boxes and construction stuff everywhere, random hair cutting chairs to sit in (not for a ""chic-modern"" feel, but because that must be all they had...it was gross), three people were at the ""desk"", but no one acknowledged us so we waited and waited until someone checking out about got helped and then I was like ""um, can I check in?"". We got there a good 15 minutes before services to fill out paperwork (which was in a big, ugly office filing cabinet). There is nothing on the walls as far as display, pictures, etc. and there is drywall showing, edges of walls not finished, etc. We can see down the hallway to the back door and at the time our appointment was supposed to start (4:30) we see the people who were idly standing at the desk bringing some foot ""spa"" machines that you buy at Walgreens or CVS and setting them up in a room. Then they get some hot water out of an electric tea kettle in the waiting room (there for that reason, not to serve tea to customers!). 

By the time  our massage therapists come to get us it is 4:45. Mine mumbles something and I assume I should follow him, so I do. I was completely confused what we were going to do first, how it worked, etc. So we are led into the room with the tubs full of water and told to put our feet in it. The room wasn't too bad, it was decorated cute except that it wasn't finished. The walls don't go up to the ceiling (nor do they in the massage room), so you can hear EVERYTHING that is going on in the place. The receptionist came in and was playing with the iPod and just acting completely unprofessional about stuff. Sitting in the middle of my Mom and I was a side table that had some dessert and two flutes of ""champagne"" on it, along with two plastic forks and two napkins. No plates or anything to put the stuff on. They also did not tell us what it was or anything. So, after about 10 minutes of sitting in there (now 4:55) they come back and start the foot scrub. This lasted until 5:06 when my massage therapist said they were done now....um...it was supposed to be for 30 minutes!! He went out and asked Jimmy and then came back with another lame excuse and then proceeded to massage my feet for about 10 more minutes (still not the  30 total). Oh...by this time, well, once the people at the beginning check out, my Mom and I are the only customers for the remainder of our visit...totally de-bunking Maya who says they are extremely busy. Whatever. 

After our feet they walk us out to a different room. I got in the second door and my mom went in the first door...but guess what!? It was the same room!! lol It was really awkward, but I was happy we were in the same room. 
My massage was pretty crappy and did not last the entire 60 minutes. Nor was there any body butter or aromatherapy used like we were told there would be. The massage beds were the cheapest available and were extremely uncomfortable. They did my massage at the same time as my mom's ""facial"" because there was only one neck thingy that you use when you lay face down. The air ducts were right above us and it was freezing in the room, so I mentioned that to my guy and he just said ""the air is on"". Nice. So I then asked for an extra blanket. He went out and got me some Wal-Mart towels and put those on me. (I know they were Wal-Mart towels because he left the tags on the bathroom floor when he took the towels out of their package). 
Facial was dollar store apricot scrub (I looked afterwards), no steam, no light, no running water, except for in bathroom. There were no lights in the place, just candles, so it was dark when we came out. Bathroom was gross. Stay away this place is horrible!!",Beauty
68IdsBfNb2BRIFVLuDpuRw,JFIr4bbO2zjQYdA3LwbbsQ,AUiX65HxQqwk1yvsBcbTdQ,2012-10-16,"I had one of the more adventurous meals of my life at Angels with Bagpipes last week, and it was excellent. 

As we were on vacation, we decided to treat ourselves to a more upscale and pricey meal, and it was worth every penny. We had a late reservation, and our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived, so we decided to enjoy a cocktail in the front bar area and peruse the menu. It's not a huge menu by any means, but it is an interesting one, so we had a difficult enough time deciding what we'd like to order. What was nice was that we were able to order prior to being seated at our table, so that we wouldn't have to wait ages for our food. (Details like that are what make some restaurant experiences great, instead of merely good.)

My cocktail (a chocolate\/orange\/espresso combination) was tasty, but I switched to wine with my food. My husband loved his gin and tonic, though, and stuck with that for the evening. I started with the beef tartare (a first for me), and it was amazing. I even enjoyed the raw quail's egg on top, and I generally have an issue with even somewhat runny eggs. Honestly, this dish was so good, I would've considered having it again for dessert! My husband had the haggis, which he really enjoyed, especially as it was wrapped in bacon. (I didn't get a bite, but I've had haggis before, so I wasn't too disappointed.) For mains, I had the trout, and again, it was very good - I particularly enjoyed the crab ""fish stick"" that accompanied it. My husband had the lamb, and here's where I got super adventurous, as it came with sweetbread and tongue, both of which I tried (another first), and coming from someone who SWORE they would never eat any kind of organ meat, I really liked both. The tongue in particular was very tender and flavorful. I don't know that I would be brave enough to eat an entire entree, but the bites I had were very enjoyable, and my husband said he'd happily order this again. He also got a side of chips, which were good, but not entirely necessary.

For dessert we decided to split the cheese plate, and it is more than big enough to share, with 5 different cheese on offer, including a fantastic goat cheese. The pear chutney was a wonderful accompaniment, and really, it was a perfect end to a perfect meal.

The restaurant isn't terribly fancy or pretentious - it's more of a place where you can dress up if you'd like to, but I felt comfortable enough in nice jeans and a sparkly top. The upstairs dining area can get a bit loud, especially if there are any large groups having dinner, but it didn't detract from our experience at all. Service, especially in the bar area, is friendly and top notch, and the food is all presented beautifully. Portions aren't huge, but everything is of the best quality and we certainly didn't leave hungry. 

We had a great night and a fantastic meal, and I would definitely go back to Angels with Bagpipes if I'm ever in Edinburgh again.",Restaurant

 ""Open 9am-9pm"" is a joke. I have to schedule appointments of any kind later in the day to avoid having to take my 18M old with
I made an appointment for 530pm then got a call the day before to ask if I could change the time at all because the masseuse I had requested had her previous appointment end at 430pm
I said I'd have to see if I could make earlier arrangements for my son and that Id call back. When I called back at 6pm no one picked up so I left a message that I could be there by 5pm the next day
Come the day of I was able to leave even earlier so I got there at 4:40pm but the door was locked & had a ""Be Back in 5mins"" note
Then the side office door opened and the masseuse apologized and let me in the office door. 
Then I heard the receptionist shout from the sidewalk ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING??""
The masseuse replied ""Just letting a customer in!""
When the woman receptionist walked into the lobby she had a confused look and said ""Customer!? Do you have an appointment?!"" 
I explained that yes I did have an appointment, originally at 530 but had changed it to 5 and then was able to come in earlier
She had been grocery shopping and set her bags down on the desk, and said ""Oooh! GOOD! We were just talking about what we were gonna do for an hour waiting around for you!""
I said ""You got my message about changing the time right? So it was only 30 mins?""
Her - ""Oh, yeah""
So already she was making me feel like a huge inconvenience and it soon became very apparent that even at 4:40pm I was the last appointment of the day for the entire facility.

The massage was good and I have no complaints there.
It ended by 5:45pm and the receptionist already had her drawer out on the desk and was counting it
I handed her a giftcard I had got for my birthday, my boyfriend told me he'd asked twice to make sure this would get me an hour massage so the male receptionist took out a sharpie and wrote ""60min massage"" on the back.
But the woman looked at me confused and asked ""What is this?!""
I thought a gift card with the words ""LaVida Massage"" on it would be pretty self-explainatory but I explained anyways.
She asked if I wanted to put a tip on the card and I said ""Im not sure how much is on there. But I have cash for the tip.""
She spent 10mins trying to convince me to become a member which I kept politely declining...but she was really pushing it and said ""Just get it now and save $20 then cancel the membership at the end of the month!"" Which I once again said ""No thank you!""
Finally she swiped the gift card and told me yes there was enough to cover my massage (well geez thanks considering thats what the gift card was for!)
I said great and proceeded to hand her a $20 and asked for change so I could leave a tip for the masseuse. (Mind you I had already stated to her ""I have cash for a tip"")
She gave me a dirty look and said very loudly ""ARE YOU REALLY GONNA DO THIS TO ME?!?""
Me - ""Excuse me??""
Her - ""Ive already counted out my drawer! You're gonna make me give you change??""
Me - ""Uhh well Id like to leave a tip.""
So after a few huffs and eye roll she finally broke my $20 and handed me back change. I took out a tip and handed it to her and she snatched it and slapped it on the desk while continuing to mumble to herself and correct her drawer count out.
No thanks...no have a good night...NOTHING!!!
I said ""Well...have a good night"" and left.

I can only hope the tip actually made it to the masseuse!!!
I am still in shock by how much the woman was just SO EXTREMELY DISREPECTFUL!
As a former retail store manager I would have let any one of those things slide once for an employee...but put them all together in just one day and it would have resulted in immediate disciplinary action!!! Because anyone who wants to stay employed just does not act like that!!!
*Grocery shopping on the clock
*Poor work ethic
*Leaving registered unlocked and open
*Treating customer with disrepect
*Overall bad attitude and refusal to uphold company standards and motto!

She completely ruined my experience and now I understand why despite being open 9am-9pm that appointment schedules are dwindling!
I can only hope for the sake of your business that you wise up and take responsibility for your employees and the experiences they are giving customers before you're forced to close your doors forever!
Ive already told my boyfriend to never get me a gift card there again!
Its sad too because I live close and would continue going there anytime I wanted a massage if it werent for the rudest receptionist ever!",Beauty
16kx3HLSi5Q2VgXdObxCwQ,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,AH0S8pIC160m-vtfbUwA3g,2014-02-11,"Without the Yelp $20 for $10 deal we may have never really given El Regio much thought.  I would have just ended up at a Roberto's.  But wow are we glad we visited!

The wifey recognized the owners of El Regio because they used to own a Mexican restaurant by her work that closed down on Rancho.  She was glad to see they were still in business because they used to make some killer (and killer cheap) breakfast burritos.  So a plus on that one.  But a minus too because it made me think, ""If they closed down their other place, was it because of the food?""  Luckily (not so luckily for them), turns out I think the owner of the building decided to sell.  Their old restaurant was demolished almost immediately after closing, and what sits there now is a brand new Checker's (which I might add I was 1st to review).

El Regio is pretty off the beaten path, located between a gas station & convenience store, and a do-it-yourself pet grooming place.  Totally non-descript.  Let your eyes wander too far down the road and you just might miss the turn into the parking lot.  Upon entering, the restaurant is fairly small.  Good guess would be that they cater to the take-out crowd.  But they do have 4-5 small tables where you can dine-in.  

The menu at El Regio is very similar in style and tone of that of your local Roberto's.  Easy to read, and includes lots of pictures.  This day, the family was in a carne asada mood.  Really, carne asada for everyone!  We were naughty, naughty, naughty in our choices.  We shared:

-Carne Asada Nachos
-Carne Asada French Fries
-Carne Asada Burrito

Steak crazy!  For good measure I got one of their special cheap combos, a Chicken Burrito with a drink for only $3.99.  You know, just to lighten the meaty mood.

Verdict?  Holy crap were we stuffed!  Greasy, cheesy, gooey, it was all there in spades.  Fatty goodness!  Please do not go to a place like El Regio and expect it to be overly healthy.  They do have a salsa bar that is complete with cucumbers, and marinated carrots & jalapenos...but that's about as far as organic it goes.  Like the old proverbs go, ""If you destroy, destroy completely"" we pulled off a ""187 on an undercover cop"" and murdered almost all that glorious carne asada!  There was A LOT to go around.  It's funny how places like El Regio builds with a thin layer of carbs on the bottom, a heaping layer of steak, a heaping layer of cheese, and a healthy scoop of sour cream & guacamole.  Healthy.  It's like they know carbs are bad and we should all be on the Atkins Diet!  

Carne asada nachos and fries were good, but like I said the layer of chips or fries to meat is skewed.  Much bigger portion of meat than carb.  Which for me = good.  I rather have more meat and cheese than more chip or fry.  These trays were pretty heavy.  I had to hold myself back from eating too much red meat in one sitting.  Good thing there was four of us to share.  There was a lot of food.  

The carne asada burrito wasn't skimpy either.  Loaded with just steak, pico de gallo, and guacamole.  Fat burrito.  We only managed to finish half of it.  I liked the chicken burrito because it actually had lots going on.  Marinated shredded chicken, Mexican rice, and pinto beans.  It was lighter which was good, I needed it to help cut through all the meat I had just eaten.  

The only real complaint any of us had was that the carne asada was a bit heavy-handed on the onions.  There was a lot more raw chopped onion on our dishes than we would have liked.  No big deal though, next time we'll just request little or no onion in our order.  

Prices are reasonable as well.  Running about the same rate as Roberto's so it really comes down to preference or location.  With multiple Roberto's locations its kinda got El Regio beat.  But for those on this side of town you should really give El Regio a try.  With my $20 for $10 coupon I only had to pay an extra $7 out of pocket.  A steal for all this food.  We had leftovers!  Which I happily took to work for lunch the next day.  Along with some Tic-Tacs.",Restaurant

I can see that quick in-and-out fixes are this store's forte...but woe to anyone who needs actual customer service, accuracy in billing, account setup, or answers beyond, ""there is nothing I can do.""

Let's begin with the shopping experience. The store is busy. Really busy. Expect a wait in the neighborhood of 10-20 minutes. That doesn't bother us. They are cordial and get us on their list and with a rep as quick as they can. So far, so good.

We are upgrading two phones into a business account. Not that tough. I want the S5 (I still loved my S3), but the clerk (Amr) talks me out of it, saying it isn't that great of a phone for the money and that it gets a lot of complaints. Odd that none of my research showed that, but I defer to his judgement. I mean, it's his job to know these things, right? I explain how I use my phone - mainly for travel - and what features are most important - such as a good camera and GPS. He points me to a phone that would save me quite a bit of money. Okay, not bad. Let's do this.

THREE HOURS later, keeping in mind that they have no bathroom nor refreshments, they are still trying to set up our account. First they have to make several calls to wherever to port our numbers and whatever else they were pretending to do. Then they mess up the credit limit thingy and have to start the paperwork over again, each clerk giving us a different answer as to what is going on. Finally, our guy runs my card and has an issue with their POS printer. (I know it means point of sale but in this case it means something else entirely.) He keeps swiping my card, insisting that the charge would not go through. I finally confiscate my card fearing how many times the charges did actually go through. The printer spits out enough pages to rival the phone book.

Finally, tired, thirsty, hungry, and a little cranky, we leave with our new phones. We go to a restaurant where I check my bank balance just to be sure I have one. Yep, I was charged three times for a total of nearly $600 OVER the amount that I should have been.

I return to the store. Amr (who is actually the store manager) insists that there is nothing he can do. These seem to be his favorite words in the world. He must have recited them 20 times during our brief, fruitless encounter. He. Did. Nothing.

Back to the restaurant, where my husband has already ordered and eaten, I get on the phone with the bank. It takes quite a while to get everything squared away, but the bank assures me that within the next 2 days my account should be back to normal. I don't know about you, but I don't have $600 sitting around doing nothing that I can just let float around in the ether, which means our rent is going to be late. Now we are 5 hours into our phone buying experience, several hundred dollars down, and a big fat mess in my bank account.

Fast forward to receiving our very first bill. The amount that we were actually charged is missing from the bill, showing as past due. Rather than just charges for the two deposits for the phones - which, as you know, we paid up front (three times over) - we are charged 4 times for 4 phone lines. We have only two phones. Did I mention the past due fees?

I call T-mobile because I want to avoid having to go back to the craphole of a store at all costs. What does the evil sadist on the phone tell me? They can't ""see"" any of those charges and are unable to do anything on their end, so I must go back to the store to avoid disconnection and further fees.

Cue Darth Vader, ""NOOOOOOOOOO!""

With tears in my eyes and hatred in my heart, I return to the store at 9:05 am, knowing that they open at 9, and hoping to avoid another long wait in line just to speak to someone who doesn't know how to do his job. I notice on the way in that one of the windows is boarded up due to a bullet hole. I am not surprised. I also notice that I am one of several people waiting outside the still-locked door. We are finally let in, past the ""Open at 9"" sign, at 9:17. Yes, I was angry enough to monitor the time.

I ask for the manager. I get Amr. I remind him who I am. You'd think that after spending the entire day together and jacking up my bank account in epic proportions that he'd remember me, but I guess he screws things up so brilliantly and so often that I'm just a face in the crowd. I show him all of the paperwork and our messed up bill.

I'll give you one guess what he says.

I am not a violent person. Honest. I feel that I should be commended for my restraint, because this smarmy-smiling, parrot-voiced, useless POS (and I do not mean Point of Sale) basically said it sucks to be me and even rounded it off with a nice, no-eye-contact, ""Have a Nice Day, Ma'am.""

Only one bullet hole. Hm.

Called TMobile from the parking lot & kept demanding the manager's manager until I got, I'm sure, one step from the CEO before I got satisfaction: corrected account and a free S5.",Shopping
zflnWcD-fB7An4LVBzFz2w,VYUf1IDtk5NWb5J7xsJqkA,V6A5FZ9OfZ7r1Tc7x4CYXg,2016-07-19,"The experience of going into the store to get a SIM card for your new unlocked phone that you recently purchased compared to going there after you've broken your screen by accident is a completely different one. Originally, my first visit, I was super stoked to get this new phone serviced. Compared to this visit - it was a R.I.P (rest in peace) moment and I was just looking for some answers to what happens next. How can I get a replacement phone? How long will it take? Will it cost anything since I have insurance? Those type of questions...

With that being said, I have to say the discrepancy in customer service from my first visit compared to the 2nd time around...calls for an updated review. Overall, I would give my 1st exp w\/ Jordan a 5 stars and this time was 1-2 stars with Robert. 

My 2nd trip here left me borderline w\/ road rage because of how frustrated I was. 

I entered the store with my broken phone and everything I thought I would need to file a claim\/get a new phone. I wasn't the only person in the store this time as there was one employee helping a grandmother with her tablet. 

Anyway, I was waiting around for a man named Robert who was either helping someone else or rounding up a conversation with a man who seemed to be close to him. I was hoping for the same type of conversation or ending to the conversation when I left. He seemed like a great guy and I'm sure he is.

I explained to Robert I had dropped my phone face down and the screen had broken while I was playing Pokémon: Go. He told me to come over to his area where he was already logged in and proceeded to dial a number which ends up being Asurion (a 3rd party company that handles insurance claims for broken phones across multiple carriers). 

OK, I get it. Verizon's policy isn't to handle claims personally, which is unfortunate because it would be great to know I don't have to deal with a 3rd party company. Especially when you're at the store in person. 

This wasn't a problem for me. However, I felt pretty abandoned by Robert because we both knew I would be on hold for a while (15 minutes) and I had a few questions about policies and what potentially my options were. Even if he couldn't answer my questions, it would be nice to have at least an ""I don't know."" Instead, he looked at his personal or work cell phone and went towards the back without really giving a reason of why he would ""be right back.""

Five minutes later, an elderly lady entered the store and wasn't greeted by the gentleman still helping the other lady with the tablet. She immediately came to me and asked if she could pay her bill. I laughed and put my shoulders up and then pointed to the man sitting down. She had to get his attention again and ask the question about her bill. At this point, I felt I was working there because it took a few minutes later for Robert to come from the back. 

After this, I was pretty uncomfortable sitting on hold (in a store) while the lady trying to pay her bill and myself are shoulder to shoulder. Fortunately, we shared a few laughs and she mentioned how ridiculous it was to be on hold, in person, at the store. However, I have to think that Robert should have multi-tasked a little better and logged in away from where I was on hold or at least started me off on the other area (which may have been in use from the other guy).

After being on hold for 15 minutes, someone from Asurion answered the phone and needed information from an address I lived in for 5 months about 5-6 years ago. I have moved 5 times since then. I couldn't provide that information without a computer or phone present to check my email to find that address. That was hard to take because now I've spent 30+ minutes out of my way - when I could have just done this online and not be here verbally vomiting on you all here on Yelp.

I'm giving this 3 stars because Jordan was awesome the 1st time I came here and Robert walked the elderly lady to her car - which was sweet.

However, I had the problem with the following which I'm docking 3 stars.
1: Verizon\/Go Wireless should just immediately tell their customers to file their claims online unless they look completely computer illiterate.
2: Lack of multi-tasking and there were only 3 customers within a 30 minute span. I can't imagine myself wanting to go here when there is an even worse ratio.
3: Inconsistentcy in customer service - I left without even saying bye or being asked why I was leaving. To me, that is a horrible time...and one I really don't look forward to doing again.
4: I'm trying to file my claim online and my exact phone isn't listed which really worries me. At this point, I feel much safer just paying my friend who can fix the screen.",Shopping
JVahOzRZoOyfSGQvQ4ybrg,2AZaPPRAWhDDO7k-jlpfwg,wWhq9cKLCrZHcp-ezp-hPQ,2010-04-25,"I went to the MIM today for their opening with the girlfriend. It was a pretty fun experience, but it's definitely not operating at 100% yet--many, many exhibits were still listed as under construction, and plenty with the a\/v setup were missing the accompanying text placards which annoyed me.

The price is $15 for adults and includes an audio headset that will automatically tune to whatever exhibit you're standing in front of. This technology isn't bulletproof, but with the receiver box in my pocket, I had no real issues: walk up to a display, the sound starts playing for that display's TV. Much better than having to dial in to every single exhibit, and lets you float from display to display with ease. 

The displays themselves are a bit dry. The formula is basically: country of origin, some instruments from said country, TV playing a few short pieces on a loop demonstrating said instruments. There are placards on many of the displays that talk a bit more about some of the cultures and backgrounds, but these are still missing at a bunch of displays. (Forgivable, as I'm sure they're working on it and today was their grand opening.) More frustrating was the lack of information about many of the specific instruments they had on display. There is a simple name, date, and material placard, but I would be much more interested to know certain details about many, many of the instruments on display, regarding their specific manufacture and history and craftsmanship, but this was only available on a relative few of the instruments there.

That said, there are TONS of instruments there, including some really great ones you've surely never seen before. (One of my favorites was basically a stringed, fiddle-like instrument amplified with a brass horn.)  Basically every single country in the world and many other regions are represented, though I thought it peculiar that Eritrea and Ethiopia shared a display, considering their hate for each other and very recent war--I know the two nations are close and likely have incredibly similar musical histories and instruments, but it just seems a bit strange.

The facility itself is beautiful. It's all brand new, clearly, and crafted in a sweeping limestone-looking facade. There's plenty of room and the building is well laid out. 

We arrived around 2:00 and spent a good two hours upstairs in their instruments exhibits, before grabbing a drink at the cafe. Neither of us realized how quickly the time had passed, so by the time we were in the artist exhibit room, the 15 minute warning had come over the loudspeaker.

The Artist Exhibits room was really quite cool. John Lennon's ""Imagine"" piano was on display with a ridiculously short clip of him playing on it. Eric Clapton's display was really fun to see as well, along with Paul Simon's. And then, as I turned the corner, I happened upon, I shit you not, a Jonas Brothers display. What. The. Fuck. (Lovingly donated by the Jonas Brothers.) I physically avoided it so as to keep their music from coming over my headset, but I truly was disappointed that the bar was lowered to ""any Disney-pop boy band that sends a few instruments"" to be featured here in a room with Paul Simon, Eric Clapton, and John fucking Lennon, amongst others. Even the Black Eyed Peas exhibit donated by their drummer showed some talent, but I guess I had hoped that a more esteemable career might be necessary to be featured in such an exhibit.

After blazing through that room, we quickly moved into the Mechanical Music exhibit which was really fun: instruments designed to play themselves like player pianos and other crazy contraptions, including a huge built-in... I don't know what to call it. An enormous organ-type device that was playing all sorts of instruments on its own, quite loudly, but in a very fun manner.

We quickly moved through there and then pushed down towards the Conservation Lab: Behind a huge glass wall, you can see their conservators inside working on instruments which was really fun, but we didn't get to explore in there at all.

Opposite that room was the hands-on exhibit, which I was *really* excited to dive in to, but just as we got our hands ""on"" the Theremin, (a device you play by moving your hands above an antenna) we were promptly told the museum was closing. At 4:50pm. Look, I understand that 5:00pm is closing time and they want to start wrangling people towards the exits, but I could've *really* enjoyed just those remaining 10 minutes in there, and it was frustrating that I didn't get it. 

The upstairs is interesting, but it quickly becomes a bit of ""more of the same"" and a bit of overload--you'll want to pace yourself, because there are just so. many. instruments that you start doing drive bys instead of really soaking things in. That, combined with the disappointing lack of collateral information visible to read on each display made me really wish we had started downstairs. 

I'll give it another shot when they've settled in, I think.",Shopping

I was blamed for everything that went wrong, insulted and accused. I was blamed for how long the stylist had to drive home, how I MADE her stay late, and how I expected too much. I was even accused of booking improperly just to make their job difficult!  It was clear to me that the use of groupon coupons were an issue here, and you would be punished if using one for your hair. The offer of a fix came in the end, but they knew I wasn't going to come back after a bad experience. That's the point, take the money and run.  When you are a business, it is YOUR JOB to be there for your customer. It is YOUR JOB to correct the issue. It is YOUR JOB to call clients when you don't like how they booked.....not the other way around. No-one ever called me once after the appointment was set and asked me to pick another time....which I would have been HAPPY to do.    These things are paid for and booked well in advance. All they had to do was say they felt they were under a time constraint, even at the time of appointment...my husband would have gave up his appointment to let them have that time on me!  So they already had my money....I wasn't going to leave even though I wanted to. I really hated that I had to complain, as it was not an easy thing for me to do! I even tried to do it a nice way because I was brought up to be a decent person to other people!  Anyone else that this would have happened to would have really flipped the F out! What I feel the real thing was is that they did not care if I left there with messed up hair because #1) they wouldn't have to fix it    #2) only one groupon per customer, so I wouldn't be back anyway. I also do not know what capsule conditioning treatment I received because that NEVER happened. Conditioner out of a pump was put on my hair and my husbands hair and dyer for ten minutes...that was the treatment we received. The owner told my husband that expensive capsules were used...invisible ones I guess.
This is bad business practices. Your goal should be to make that first time customer so freakin happy,  they will return. These don't care if you return. They will just sell more coupons to other people and fill the seats.  I forwarded my pics to other salons in the area...they were in agreement...ALL of them....I was taken advantage of, treated badly by action and response, and my hair was awful. I noticed that anyone person, here on yelp,  that posted a bad review received a lashing from the owner blaming them as the reason.  I didn't get my money back not even one dollar..the girl was tipped and they charged me extra money on the way out the door without even discussing it with me!  Everyone and every salon I talked to about this said they would have told them to F -off if asked for extra money on the way out the door.  So I paid extra for a bad job, this so they could make sure I never returned again. I would be ashamed as a stylists and FEEL something for my customer if it were me! I was told by the owner that what did I expect....my stylist to stay until 10pm to fix my hair!  ""So what if I had a bleed and a little dye on me..whats the big deal""  AND YES....if you screw up someones hair it is YOUR JOB TO STAY as long as you need to and FIX it!  But I did not ever ASK her to stay late to do anything!  I didn't know my hair was the way it was until I got home and looked in the mirror! Actually...my husband told me at dinner that your ears are filled with black dye! There is no way my stylists did not know the issues with my hair and that the dye was still on my scalp, ears and neck when I left. She left me walk out into public like that and did not seem to have any problem doing so.   My hair was not styled either and I looked like shit upon walking out the door to go to dinner. I asked everyone I know that has their hair dyed, does your hair get styled at the end and they all said YES. SHE DID NOT care in the least.  I would be ashamed and embarrassed as an owner and do everything I could to fix the situation, not blame the customer. And I know there are A-hole people out there that will complain for nothing...but I am not one of them. All customers shouldn't be treated with contempt because you don't like people....and that is exactly how I feel!  No empathy...NOT from this place. They tried to make me out to be the bad guy to cover up all of their issues, lied, and cheated me. There is no remorse from anyone, and I feel really bad about this experience. I feel like I went to my worst enemy for hair services. :(  I tipped this person and well...she charged me more money on the fly....and then let me leave the building with black hair dye all over my neck, ears even inside of them, and still on my scalp...it was caked on my head like my hair had not been rinsed.

Bad: Service, Food, atmosphere.

Not impressed at all. On a Sunday night, the service was agonizingly slow. We got waters when we sat down, but the waitress didn't come back for another 20 minutes to take our orders. ""Oh hey, I didn't want to interrupt your conversation, it looked like you were having a good time."" Really? Maybe we were animatedly conversing about how hard it is to get a server's attention. We ordered some cocktails and food to share.

The drinks were very well mixed; between the three of us, we had the Natt Spil daquiri, the Creole Napoleon, and some other drink that had an interesting name but NO DESCRIPTION. Seriously, how are people supposed to order something to drink when they have no idea what is in it? What's in the Kingston Tingle? Rum with a dash of syphilis? Normal bars have descriptions of their drinks; I know you want to be a special snowflake but making it inconvenient to order drinks via slow service + no description doesn't really entice people to come back. 

The food we ordered took quite a while to come out, probably due to the fact that there was only one guy working the open kitchen. The shu mai was a sad travesty of what it is supposed to be. The dumpling skin was rubbery and tough, like it had been steamed too long; the sauce was a brown, gloopy mess. The filling was a lump of mystery meat. (Here's a thought, maybe you could put some more effort into describing what is on your menu! *GASP*)

The spring rolls we ordered were a) stuffed with literally the most flavorless things you could find (shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded cabbage, what appeared to be clover, tofu, and some other crap) and loosely wrapped with a sheet of rubber. Just kidding, it was rice paper that hadn't been soaked long enough. The spring rolls were ensconced on a bed of shredded lettuce and cabbage and drowned with a sweet chili sauce diluted with rice vinegar. The spring rolls were quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. Not only were they so loosely wrapped they flopped around like a limp d*ck, they had absolutely no taste and no redeeming qualities. The three cup chicken dish should be renamed ""Chicken Stir Fry That Bears No Resemblance To The Actual Three Cup Chicken Dish."" It literally tasted like chicken stir fry you can get at the Memorial Union (except there you would save like $5 and be able to hear your friends talk, and not walk into tables because it's so  dark.) Here is a link to a great recipe for three cup chicken [http:\/\/rasamalaysia.com\/three-cups-chicken-recipe\/]; even if you are the worst cook and f*ck it up completely, it will probably still taste better than Natt Spil's offering.

Lastly, let's talk about the atmosphere that the pretentious hipsters that opened this place are going for. Madison Magazine described it as ""[evocative of] a Taiwanese beer hall"" (and for those of you who need a geography refresher, Taiwan is that tiny island off the coast of China), but I would describe it as ""hipster steampunk opium den."" Seriously, there is literally a giant a** picture of a person smoking a pipe in the back room. Let's move on to their business model: no phone, no sign, cash only, terrible menu layout, dim lighting, a weird name which means absolutely nothing to most people (apparently Natt Spil = Norweigian for 'night play'),  slow service, and really, terrible food. Your menu is deliberately a ""hodgepodge"" of ""pan-global comfort food,"" but maybe you should limit yourself. Stick to what you know, and what you know apparently is NOT Asian food.",Restaurant
GtXp-_HxviEJ2eANLGObzQ,3aASPImVNonE79TtW_RxuQ,wBJyTzjlDCjF9fM9o_izWQ,2014-08-21,"Thanks to all the fantastic Yelp reviews, I added this spa to my Vegas itinerary this past week. I'd visited Qua the previous day, and walked about a mile up the strip to get to Encore and buy a day pass* (see comments at bottom of review-- basically, day pass is supposed to be available only for hotel guests). 

From the moment you step into it, this spa is extremely luxurious. If you want to feel that you are living the life of the 1%, you have come to the right place. The robes are nicer. The tea bags are silkier. The air smells fancier. The magazines in the lounge are the ones you would read if you were not a person who frantically flips through US in the checkout line to learn whether Kim Kardashian is in fact getting a divorce. The bathroom has striped curtains on either side of it, held back by tassels and large seashells, because on this day you are a woman whose life looks like a Vogue spread even when she is on the way to the toilet.

At the very back of the spa is the room holding two large heated tubs, two cold plunges, the waterfall and ""experience showers"" (I'll get to those), heated lounges, and two statues of Kwan Yin framed by iridescent pearls. This facility is beautiful. The 80-degree cold plunge is a very nice touch. I've gone to many spas in numerous states, including several Korean spas, and only the bravest among us actually use the cold plunges (read: not me). But this one was pleasant, like a lake on a spring day, and I could step all the way into it up to the waist. The heated lounges are nice-- about the same as the ones at Qua, which is to say mildly warm. Just outside this room there is a eucalyptus-scented steam room as well as the prettiest dry sauna I have ever seen. It's really lovely, with a lot of stone and reclaimed wood.

The facilities, though, have a few shortcomings. I'm saying these things not to criticize, but to help you figure out which of the numerous excellent Vegas spas you'd prefer to spend your time at. For one thing, the two hot pools are identical in every way-- setup, temperature, jets. This means that while the room gives the appearance of four pools to use, it's actually three, only one of which is hot\/warm. By contrast, Qua has three hot\/warm pools of different temperatures plus a cold plunge. Also, you can turn on the jets for the hot pool, but this causes a *lot* of foam to suddenly build up. I found that unpleasant enough to not press that button twice.

The ""experience showers"" were the main reason I visited this spa. It isn't the spa's fault what fantasies I had conjured in my head, but the reality of these showers wasn't very impressive. They're a little complicated to set up, and then they're not much different at all from the spa showers either near the dressing rooms either here or at Qua. The light color changes above you; that's about it. There *is* a ""deluge shower"" that will pour a waterfall over your head or shoulders for two minutes, and that's pretty nice if you stave off the guilty feelings about your water usage. 

And then, the dressing room showers. It's a separate room, but I'm referring to the ""get clean"" ones rather than the ""spa experience"" ones. They barely get warm. It's kind of ridiculous. I walked all over the spa in a towel for several minutes before I finally found a staff member, and I asked her why the shower wouldn't heat up. She came over, fidgeted with it, then gave me a funny look and said, ""It's warm. See? It's warm right now."" Well, barely-- I won't be shivering, but that's not usually even close to what I think of as ""shower temperature."" Boo hoo, I know, but after an experience this relaxing, nobody wants to be frustrated at the very end.

Overall, the best thing about this spa was the sheer luxury of it. Even with just a day pass and no specific treatment, you feel pampered and swathed in luxury. I do think Qua has the advantage in terms of its saunas and pools, and service is more attentive there, but I appreciated the loveliness of this environment and how peaceful it was.

From the top: *When I arrived, I was dismayed to be told that day passes are only available to guests of the hotel. I sorta gave the guy a hard time about that, saying I hadn't seen that mentioned on Yelp and that I'd made a special trip because I'd heard such good things about the facility (I'd also checked the website and saw nothing about this). He relented and let me in for the $40 fee, which was nice of him. But I double-checked the website once I got home, and indeed it says nothing about day passes only being available to guests of the hotel. If they want that to be a policy, they really should mention it",Beauty
QcWjgW8mttMyKEEs0PFw6A,dREGi-4_jtM4n0hG1FH7-g,sluEW1bvEPqjGmn6vY6oag,2013-11-18,"Just had it out with the pharmacist, who I can't even believe passed pharmacy school. 
We came about 9pm right after my surgery. I am in a rental car so I am the only one who can drive it, so even though I had emergency surgery, I still had to drive. Anyway we went through the drive through. We came close to 10 so the pharmacist who by the way looks Chubacca, (so you'll know her when you see her!) had a bad attitude from the get. Anyway I was given 3 prescriptions which needed to be filled, this meaning WORK for her big lazy ass! She slowly and RUDELY took my info, then told me it would be 30 minutes and waddled away. At least that was pretty quick, so I said ok and preceded to return some texts and emails in the drive through while waiting, with no one behind me of course. Seeing me out the corner of her coke bottle glasses, she STORMED back over,
""HEY, HEY, LADY, you cant sit there, you need to move it NOW!"" She told me (even MORE RUDELY) 
""Move along now!"" and she Shoo-ed me away with her spastic hand motions...HOW RUDE! So I finished what I was doing, maybe 3 seconds, hunted for the gear shifter in the rental, that took a another second or 2, then, I can barely move my legs due to the surgery so pressing the gas took me a couple more, so I am sure I looked like a disobedient smart ass to Pharmacist Elnas AKA Chubacca, and clearly yes... I am quite the smartass, but I wasn't being I was just in INTENSE PAIN! 
Hello people don't usually end up in the pharmacy at their best right? Which means they should have be pretty damn good by now at customer service when working there, No!??  Anyway she then RUDELY told me how she wasn't going to fill my prescription now. 
""Hahha oh ok Miss(ssss), guess what? Now I don't feel comfortable filling this.""
""I don't like you so that is my right."" She said. YOUR RIGHT? You don't like ME? Not my attitude, not my pain or even my seemingly smart ass too slow for even your slow ass movement...but you don't like ME, CHUBACCA? 
""I have done nothing wrong, what are you talking about, I am in PAIN!"" I exclaimed! ""Great so take a walk on in the store then and I'll fill it in here."" She said. 
I responded AN, ""I can't walk lady, I just got out of emergency surgery!"" 
""Too bad here is a CVS down the street."" She said, and she waddled away. 
That is when I flipped. I laid on the horn until she returned, asked for her name and license. Told her she was going to lose her job, at some point after she told me she wasn't going to fill it I started recording video of which I played a portion of for so could see herself and how she was acting. MIRACULOUSLY she apologized. 
""Please don't complain."" she said, 
""I'll give you a gift card!"" She said. 
""I'll fill your prescription."" 
""Sorry it's just store policy."" 
Hmmm that attitude you just watched your self give on tape, is that CVS store policy too? Funny what people start to offer when they see what their boss and the Arizona State Board of Pharmaceutical Licensing will see. Not to mention the attitude, the customer service and the blatant disregard for human well being & discrimination for the half crippled blonde with a doctors recommendation for pills because she just rolled off the surgery table! AHHHHHH. 
Whatever she rectified it. I got a $25 gift card to go with my now higher blood pressure. Still, it that was my grandma she was treating like that? Or yours. Or some other sore half crippled person in pain, or bad health or sickness. I just wouldn't want to have not done my part. I'm still going to complain...
1. To you, fellow Yelpers! 
2. To her boss
3. To corporate CVS
4. To the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy
So good luck Pharmacist Elnas Chubacca, may your days in some other industry be plenty and bright! And may your days of wanting to be fat and lazy because your shift is almost over, and when someone doesn't get your happy little I went to pharmacy school and now I work at CVS power trip...be few and far between. STOP BEING RUDE to people who don't want to be there in the first place, when you are the one getting paid, WELL, to be there filling little bottles, when you probably don't want to be either.
There are too many other people who need good jobs! 
I will never go back to the Chubacca CVS. Not even to use my $25 gift card. I will take her advice and go to the one down the street. And when I stop for gas? I hope she is the attendant behind the counter serving up slurpees, oh wait, with that attitude, she doesn't even deserve that position. Go talke some customer service classes you RUDE mean person. See, I can be mean too! But I didn't call you Chubacca once! I was probably TOO nice to you which is why I needed to get all this out. DON'T send your prescriptions, your family or friends...let alone your hard earned dollars to this store or pharmacy. Unless you are looking for bribes for dealing with Chubacca, after all RUDE jerks need jobs too right?

QFlMzlbRC8Xu8oKTtuZr-w,WmXouMxdpbiXen4H-PCMUg,kRgAf6j2y1eR0wOFdzFAuw,2013-12-30,"I have been going to Firefly for years.  It was recommended to me first by a close friend that worked in the restaurant industry in Vegas as a locals place. I went to the original location one block away and since the move, have been to the new location a few times now.  I make it a point to visit this place each time I visit Vegas on business or pleasure.  I recommend this place to all my friends, family, and co-workers.

On my recent visit on 12\/28\/13, my family (4 of us total..kids were 10 and 14) enjoyed:

1) Red Sangria - Get a pitcher(s) of this stuff.  It is the nectar of the wine gods.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and tart on a hot or warm day and compliments all the dishes they have well.

2) Tapas Style - Since moving to the new larger location, they changed their menu and added more flare.  
  - Tomato-basil soup and grilled cheese is light, flavorful, and refreshing.
  - Shrimp ceviche is cool refreshing, seasoned well and balanced in flavor.
  - Stuffed Dates had a smoky bacon wrapped around a semi-sweet date with an almond inside.  It was a great combination of flavors and the crunch added a nice texture.
  - Firefly Fries are a large portion of garlic and parmesan goodness.
  - Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese was the kid's favorite.  Fresh and homemade with real cheeses.
  - Chicken Skewers was another kid's favorite.  There was a roasted garlic cream that added some good flavor to the chicken.
  - Serrano Sliders were really tasty and tender.  We added some of the onion straws it came with as a garnish in the slider to kick it up a notch.
  - Merguez...my wife doesn't like sausage but this lamb sausage was great.  Not very gamey but a good rich tasting meat complimented with red peppers.
  - Lamb Chops - It was like eating candy...it was lamb as it should be with a base of seasoning that brought out a slight pleasant sweetness.
  - Camarones a la Diabla - Shrimp in a spicy sweet sauce.  Hands down one of the best dishes there.  The sauce is so good...ask for extra bread for dipping.
  - Desserts for us consisted of our favorites...flan and tres leches cake.  The flan is traditionally made and the flavor of the custard has an almond taste to it...the tres leches cake is moist and sweet to eat.

3) Service - The servers, runners, and bussers were fantastic.  Our drinks were always filled, table was clutter free, and our server checked in at the right moments.  

4) Ambiance - The new location is much easier to get in and out of.  The décor and layout of the restaurant was very open and relaxing.

Overall...great job on the new location and new menu!",Restaurant
sBoL1EfbL30aGMoplqdD6A,EHg98-8QvhwVEGAl5tpXwg,dEi4_bO8ydNHgcRNKV8q6g,2007-08-05,"I can't believe the reviews that this place has received so far!  WOW!!

I concede, yes it is very expensive when compared to other gyms, but a BMW is expense when compared to a Ford....

In my life I've belonged to The Courthouse (tiny gym), LA Fitness, ASU Student Rec Center, Q Fitness (now 24 hour fitness) and the YMCA and I can honestly say that all pale in comparison to this facility.  Quick disclaimer: Not all LifeTime Fitness centers are the same!  The one in Gilbert is great, but not as amazing as this facility.  When I moved to MN (home of LifeTime Fitness) I actually plotted out where we would live based on the proximity to one of their gyms.  The closest one to me is in no way comparable to the facility in Tempe and as a result we are no longer members.  If I lived even remotely close to a facility like this one I would join again in a heartbeat.  Now on to the review.

My wife actually signed us up under the family plan without me around.  When she told me how much it was (~$90\/month for the entire family) I was a bit put back.  But after my first visit I felt the money was well spent and that we were even getting a deal!

I often describe this facility as a ""country club"".  Everything about this place is just amazing.

Locker Rooms - Incredibly well appointed with a ton of space, a lounge, sauna and steam room.  The lockers are large and their card\/key system saves a lot of time for those of us that always forget to bring a lock with them.

Cardio - There's no way anyone can complain about this!  Even at peak times there are almost always machines available in every category (treadmill, bike, elliptical, etc).  The machines are well maintained and the abundance of large screen TVs will keep you distracted from your achy legs.

Weight Machines - You name it, they have it.  There are more here than I would ever use, but if you want to work that little muscle that connects those two things that you n ever use, they probably have a machine here to do it.

Free Weights - They have a ton of free weights with some set-ups that I have yet to find in other facilities.  Plenty of space to workout and plenty of weights for everyone to use.

Basketball - Two full size courts that are open and clean.  Great courts to play on.

Squash - Probably my one complaint is that they have squash courts and no racquetball courts.  Of course most would argue that squash is more technical than racquetball and I should get some skill and stop bitching.

Rock Climbing - Probably one of the most underused aspects of the gym.  I rarely saw people on this, but is was a heck of a set-up!

Tennis - This was extra and since I'm not much of a tennis player I didn't sign up for this feature, but it seemed like a nice facility.

Pool - Indoor and outdoor pools, so you can swim all year long.  The outdoor pool had some AMAZING ""scenery"" during the warmer months.  I wouldn't go so far as to compare it to a Vegas hotel pool, but it was darn impressive!

Kid Zone - This is one of the things that sold it for us.  The facility for kids was outstanding, with separate areas set up for different ages and an abundance of activities and areas for all kids.  Indoor, lower hood basketball.  Outdoor play area.  Huge indoor ""jungle gym"".  Computers.  Crafts.  This truly was an amazing part of the gym.  And the great thing is, if you want to relax instead of work out, this aspect of the gym becomes even more helpful!  You want to get a haircut and a massage?  Drop the kids off and head to the spa!  You want to sit back and relax?  Drop the kids off and head to the pool or hot tub.  The kids look forward to it and it's great for the parents!

Spa - My wife used this more than me and was happy with the experiences that she had here.  We didn't use it as much as we could have, but no complaints.

Cafe - Decent food for a little cafe in a gym.  I ate many a breakfast there on my way to work after a cardio session.  

Overall I just don't think that I've ever been in a better gym.  Yes it's expensive, but even at a higher price I feel as if I always got a good deal for the money I spent.",Beauty
_Sg-livml4QbBzkDQqYBPg,yL60onlTh1BmJKVLli_K3g,4PrIkFRA0cwrXsh1Yd-f6w,2017-09-18,"I purchased a Groupon for two services here, a choice of microdermabrasion or  chemical peel. I am a bit leery of anything to do with the word ""chemical"" so I chose microdermabrasion. 

When I called to make my first appointment, the gentleman who answered the phone was extremely polite and courteous while speaking to me. He answered my questions and scheduled me in for my preferred time and day. So far, so good. 

On the day of my appointment, I left the house with no makeup on, since they would just be taking it off anyway. Over the past couple of years, I've developed some redness on my left cheek and forehead, which seems to get worse on certain days. I'm not quite sure what causes it, which is why I'm seeking out various skin care remedies to treat it. I used to have completely clear, beautiful skin so this has been extremely depressing for me and I feel incredibly self-conscious about it. 

When I walked into the clinic, the woman behind the desk (Silvia) looked up and I told her I was there for my appointment. She looked at me and said in kind of a loud voice, ""What's wrong with your face?"" I was mortified and instantly felt extremely embarrassed that I had left the house without makeup on. I glanced around and saw a few people (likely staff) turn to look at me while I stammered a reply, something to the effect of, ""That's what my face looks like without makeup and that's why I'm here."" I couldn't believe her lack of professionalism - I was actually shocked at how rude it was to blurt that out. 

Anyway, after completing the intake form, I was taken into a room for my treatment where a lovely young woman asked a series of questions and we spoke about the treatment. After completing the microdermabrasion, I went to the front counter to schedule my next appointment and pay the tax on my Groupon. Silvia apologized to me, saying that someone on her staff had pointed out that she had been rude to me. She seemed genuinely surprised that it was perceived that way, and went on to make a few excuses for the comment she had made. I thanked her for the apology, scheduled my next appointment and left. 

I don't know why, but her comment stung quite a bit. Probably because I felt vulnerable without makeup and wasn't expecting a ""professional"" to react that way, but also because her apology seemed pretty insincere. 

My next appointment was a couple of months later and upon going into the clinic, I had that uncomfortable feeling return. The service was fine and the technician was great (I don't remember her name, unfortunately) but in all, it was really not a relaxing experience. I hesitated between two and three stars, but ultimately I thought the actual service was fine so I stuck with three stars. 

I understand it's a clinic and not a spa, but they would do well to maybe oil the door hinges so they don't squeak so loudly - not to mention every time they open\/close a door, it sounded like they were slamming them. It's just the layout of the rooms - the walls don't go up to the ceiling, so you can hear every noise, including all the loud voices in the hall. Also, several times people walked into my treatment room by mistake. It was just very disconcerting. I think there's an expectation of privacy and perhaps a somewhat quiet environment when getting these treatments done that is not present at this clinic. I could certainly overlook this if everything else was great, but it just felt like one more thing that added to the list of reasons not to return. 

I made a joke about getting some WD40 for the squeaking door hinges to Silvia, but she just stared at me and said she didn't understand what that was. I tried to explain but it didn't seem to matter. Oh well. 

I had come prepared this visit with my tinted moisturizer to apply before leaving, which I did in the washroom. When I was done, there was no ""thanks for coming"" or any conversation about any follow up treatments - in fact, when I saw Silvia in the hall and asked if there was anything else, she just said no, so I left feeling like they didn't even want my business. This, combined with my initial feeling on my first visit, I guess I shouldn't feel bad about not going back. 

Whenever I try a new place (Groupon or not) the question I ask myself is would I return (and pay full price)? In fact, I'm more likely to return in future when I feel like I got a great deal on my first visit. In this case, my response would be no to both. Even with a discount, I'm not interested in going back. 

I've tried a few other places in the past couple of months and I'm happy to say I've found a place that I feel really good about and have chosen to go there instead for my future skin care needs. 

Customer service is so important in this industry so I truly hope that Silvia can try to be more tactful towards her clients in the future.",Beauty
OSA-3cJOAlsLHXJ8rjmoBg,7f781UcgcRoFwtUR1IsB1Q,bivEAahbqAwdDOFgL7g9YA,2010-11-13,"A few months ago, I had a pleasant meeting with the sales manager at a local Einstein's. Being that I had just moved from San Diego, and had started riding again, I was looking for a new bike shop. Surely there are none as GREAT as Adam's Ave. in San Diego, and so far, I continue to believe this.

I went in to investigate the store, and upon cursory glance noticed a $30 Specialized bike pump being sold for $70. Hmmmm. Interesting. 

I went out for a ride last week, and, in my youthful exuberance, forgot my water bottles. I know! WHO DOES THAT!? Along the route was Bicycle Haus. I had a few meager dollars in my kit, and was in need. Surely they would help a fellow cyclist out. I entered, and I did so, feeling like I was getting stabbed by eyeballs. A better term: eye fucked. 
""Who is this enemy intruder, sporting different colors, and wearing a foreign kit?"" 
""Details."", I thought as I stated my case for two water bottles. After being sized up, the guy behind the counter pointed nonchalantly, and said, ""Over there."" 
After grabbing two bottles, I reached into my kit, and told him I was unsure if I had the $12 and change he requested. I asked if I could bring in the $1.50 or so I may have been short, upon completion of my ride.
 He says, ""I'm sorry, you're going to need to leave one of the bottles behind if you can't pay for both."" OVER A DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS?! 
Turns out, I had $13 in cold hard American currency to pay the man. But it left a really bad taste in my mouth. 

I live on the road that the BH crowd frequents on their way to get their LGO caffeine fix. I find them to be a generally unfriendly, pompous, and arrogant  lot. No wave, no smile and nod, no common cycling courtesies. When seen at LGO, they do the same.

I was passing this story along to a guy that I ride with, and he said that they do group rides on Monday and Wednesdays. My days might be off, so forgive me. His personal experiences ring like mine, however he passed one on that left me convinced of the depth of douchebaggery owned by these guys. 

Picture if you will: Group ride winding down. They get to their destination, and one rider develops a slow leak, which by the conclusion of post-ride hanging out has gone flat. He goes to his trusty steed, and finds a hoof gone wrong. Upon asking fellow riders for assistance (tube and Co2), they shrug shoulders and leave. Trusty steed and rider hobbled, he is forced to walk home 1.5 miles, with hobbled steed in tow. Inappropriate. Grossly, and wildly inappropriate. 

Get it together, guys. Most definitely NOT what the owner had in mind for his store. 

***UPDATE***: While at breakfast this morning, I had the honor of being enlightened with a story from a friend about the Bicycle Haus. We were talking about my posting, and she said that she had been asked TO NOT COME BACK to BH because she ""does not buy enough stuff"" at BH. She is a mountain biker, and was coming in regularly to get service done on her mountain bike. Along with her service stop, she would pick up some post ride bars, and whatnots, and drop her bike, and go. Seems as though they did not take kindly to her ""quickies"" and asked her to stop coming in, all together. And now one of the service guys calls to ask her come to come back in?? Seriously?  

And so, I was left thinking to myself, ""That figures."" when I heard of these shenanigans. They can have em, cuz we don't want em! 

But, hey, if the ""coolest, sexiest, hippest"" poser shit, some nose high attitude self-absorbed, pompous people, and bad service are what you're after, than it sounds like this is YOUR place! BUT... If you're an established, legitimate cyclist, and you look for inconsequential things like good service, competent wrenches, good vibes, good peeps, a smile, an appreciative owner who is thankful for your patronage, and and fun group of people who frequent the shop than you just might want to search elsewhere. I would suggest Adam's Avenue, but maybe I'm the only one willing to pack all of my bikes and drive them to San Diego.

***Update #2*** I have never received ""hate mail"" for a post, until I did from a dude named Robert who said that I was a ""douchebag, wanna-be asshole"" for writing the review I wrote on BH.

Who would think I could irk someone SO MUCH just by expressing my opinion? Love you, Robert. ;)

It would be of no loss if this place did not survive the economy.

It is billed as luxurious but it does not even come close to what I consider a luxury hotel restaurant. I have a family member in the hotel business and I have dined at many hotels and resort restaurants across the country that are far superior to this one. Each time I have eaten here, it feels like they are skimping on portions but charging you top dollar. And the dishes aren't very special, especially for the money paid.

I have eaten here twice, once for  brunch this past summer and today on Christmas. I have to say the food is overpriced and okay but  not great;  and the portions are small. Service seems somewhat slow as well. The first time I went for breakfast, I had an omelet which was nothing special. Others in our party got chicken and waffles  and shrimp and grits which they enjoyed but again the portions size was not adequate IMHO. Two members of the party did say the bloody mary's were good. 

The Christmas menu sounded good in theory but the execution left something to be desired with regard to the prix fixe menu. There was a choice of a la carte menu or prix fixe dinner. I got the scallops from the a la carte which well cooked but you only got 4 medium sized scallops and some kind of inedible garnish for $32. I also did a french onion soup which was the BEST dish of the night- good portion, nice broth with onions nice cheesy big crouton which formed a creamy consistency with the broth- one of the best I have had ( I give credit where credit is due even if other aspects of the dining experience were disappointing). I had the whipped potatoes as a side dish and they were decent. I skipped desert. They had several types of interesting breads  to choose from with three types of butter which were quite good. But they act like it is gold. Instead of giving you a small bread basket with different choices, they come around and dole out the small pieces of bread in a piecemeal fashion one by one - what's up with that?

My husband got the prime rib on prix fixe menu, but it was some weird configuration. Instead of being the traditional sliced prime rib with au jus It was like they formed it into some kind of beef roll and cooked it, then sliced  as slab of meat, with horseradish and garlic and very little au jus. Even the server admitted that the chef had gone out on the limb and reimagined a classic instead of just serving a class prime rib. No where in the description did they explain it that way. The server SHOULD have make him aware that it was not the classic prime rib and really explained the dish. His meal included a cream of mushroom soup which he liked and a very pitiful looking small beet salad- he said that the portion should have been doubled to be like a real salad instead of a taste of beet salad.  The dinner also came with a choice of a eggnog and gingerbread dessert or a chocolate dessert. He chose the eggnog dessert.

Instead of giving you a whole piece of gingerbread poundcake, topped with eggnog ice cream and garnished which cream and small chocolates, they put a Tablespoon of eggnog ice cream on a plate, surrounded by some CUBES of gingerbread pound cake which was somewhat dry ( not an entire slice) along with some dollops of cream and about 2 small chocolate candies and some ginger slices- just pitiful. The prix fixe menu was $50.  Our entire meal with wine and a badly prepared old fashioned which was not properly mixed came to $148 with tip. NOT WORTH IT.  We did not want to cook  for Christmas, but we could have done better by buying a dinner at a local grocery store instead of dining here. 

While we were dining we could see servers taking items to the bar as many people were dining in there. That food looked better that what was being served in the dining room. I doubt seriously I would return to this hotel to dine again.  I don't want to be disappointed again. There are too many other places to try in CLT, but if on chance we did go back, I would look at the bar menu instead of the Gallery Restaurant. Based on two experiences at this restaurant, I can't recommend it.",Restaurant

4.5 stars, rounded up.

Exterior - unassuming, hole-in-the-wall looking almost.  Don't let that fool you!
Interior - open kitchen and extremely smelly.  I left the place smelling like grease and oil - yuck.  They had the fan off today because it's so frigid outside - something about cold air coming inside - which makes sense.  Also, half the lights were off and it was almost like eating in an abandoned store.  Mostly, the -.5 points comes off here.

The chef and his wife are both Sri Lankan.  I asked the wife how they would categorize their dishes - Italian fusion... interesting.  I noticed that the wife went around each table and asked each party where they found out about the restaurant and all said the same - online.  Then I noticed she mentioned to everyone that if they enjoyed their experience, to please write about it online.  Good marketing tactic I suppose, but I'm writing my review not because I was asked, but because I feel like this place deserves some love.  

Dishes are cooked to order and may take a little longer than you would expect, but it comes out hot and fresh.  The presentation is amazing - they really take their time to make your dishes look tasty.

Food:

$25, prix fixe - 3 courses.

Pan-seared quail - this is some of the best poultry\/bird I have ever had.  I don't usually like poultry!  Wonderfully seasoned and flavorful quail on top of a bed of argula, pomegranate, and blackberries.  My favorite out of the 3 dishes.  Perfectly cooked.

Ontario braised lamb ribs - 6 ribs, fall of the rack juicy and quite fatty as well.  Also seasoned very well with a special type of BBQ sauce on top.  Mashed potatoes were funky - seemed like they weren't actual potatoes, but rather the powdered stuff - not a fan.  I had vegetables on my plate that I had never seen before and asked about them - a purple heirloom carrot and a golden beet!  Love how creative and unconventional the veggies are.  Also came with bok choy, a giant broccoli crown, white asparagus, string beans, and the most perfectly grilled red pepper.  This was actually a lot of food and it's one of those feelings where you eat it and it's really good and afterwards you want to throw up a little because it was so much.

Butternut squash + coconut panna cotta - the texture of the panna cotta wasn't quite right - it was a little too runny and soft.  Still, it was delicious.  Smooth, creamy, and milky.  The whole thing tastes a little like egg nog.

Service was great - my napkins were replaced and I was always asked how I was doing.  Wifey is a great conversationalist as well.",Restaurant
RLoTQ9BLZxqbOjoEE5ZfyA,46HhzhpBfTdTSB5ceTx_Og,6gF-m1csJtckBSJEmIpsTg,2012-03-25,"Asiana is kind of a hit and miss type place, as any ""fusion"" place is in my opinion. Especially when the food isn't ""fused"", but just two separate menus. It's a bit confusing since you are given two menus. The main menu contains everything, which includes appetizers, sushi, hibatchi, noodle bowls, rice bowls, and a few Indian-inspired dishes. The second menu has just the Indian-inspired dishes, so it's kind of pointless since those items are already listed on the regular menu. 

While the menu may be a mess, the rest of the restaurant is not. If you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy a meal with that special someone, this may be the place. Not only is it naturally quiet but the tables are all given plenty of personal space, so you will not be rubbing elbows with your neighbor. The staff was also pretty friendly. While our particular waitress seemed to be a bit out there, the other employees (possibly the manager or cook) came out several times to see how things were going. 

For an appetizer we ordered the chicken lollipop ($6). It was not what I expected...it consisted of six huge chunks of chicken on bone. It was deep fried in a heavy batter that was spiced, and served with a spicy oil-based sauce that had some garlic, lime, cilantro and other stuff in it. Here's the thing with the chicken: it would have been good if I was chilling at a bar and ordered it as bar food or a late-night snack. However, this dish was simply too heavy for an appetizer at a Asian\/Sushi\/Indian restaurant, and the oily sauce was just not a good option as I would have preferred a more ""dippable"" sauce.

We also ordered one roll of sushi as an appetizer, since we had heard and read that the sushi was not the best. This ended up being quite true. We ordered the kamikaze roll ($13) which had some tempura shrimp with crab, eel and salmon. Unfortunately the roll was served warm and had quite the ""fishy"" taste to it. Now I know some people may say ""what do you expect when you order a sushi roll with a tempura item"" but I have had plenty of tempura-filled sushi, and the rest of the roll is never that warm. Sure there's a warm part where the fried item is but the rest of the roll (particularly the fish part) still remains cold. This was quite the turn-off, and I would never order sushi from here again.

Then it was dinner time. I ordered the tandoori rice dinner with beef ($12.) It was a spicy dish consisting mostly of basmati rice with the beef, egg, onion, sprouts, cashews and raisins all covered with a some ""Indian"" spices. I was pleased with the overall dish, and particularly enjoyed the spice. It was the perfect level of heat that I find ideal to my own personal taste, as it was hot enough to get a heat in your throat and for your nose to run, but not hot enough to the point where I needed a sip of milk with each bite. I must add that you get plenty of food for the price, as I didn't even finish half my order. They really do heap the food into your plate, and if you can finish your entire order in one sitting by yourself then you must be a Sasquatch.

The miss' went with the haka noodles with scallops ($12) which was scallops, noodles, egg, cabbage, and other veggies in a somewhat sweet sauce. This was also a pretty good dish. I have to say that the scallops were cooked perfectly, as they were at just the right texture. I really enjoyed the sauce that it was served with, as it was light and sweet and definitely not as heavy or salty as you would get with a lo mein dish. Like my rice dish, this one was also chock full of food, and the miss' will probably get at least two more lunches out of her leftovers.

We also grabbed a dessert to go (we wouldn't normally, but had a coupon for a free dessert.) Since we were taking it home it kind of eliminated some of the dessert choices, and in the end we settled on the tiramisu ($6.) I wasn't expecting much at all, and those expectations were definitely met when we cracked open the  container and attacked the dessert. There was virtually no coffee flavor and an overall flavor of ""sweet"" definitely overpowered the tiramisu. It was a decent serving size (the miss' and I split it and were content with the size we had) but the flavor was just wrong, wrong, WRONG. While I wasn't expecting good tiramisu from a restaurant focusing on Asian cuisine, I guess part of me just had to see how the approached it. Maybe I was hoping for a ""fusion"" tiramisu with some Indian spices or something, but nope, just a sugary piece of cake.

It was hard to rate Asiana. Part of me wanted to give it a few more stars for the nice interior, friendly staff and solid entrees. Yet another part of me was torn with the overall menu and horrible sushi. In the end I think three stars is just about right...I'd be willing to go back for an entree, but I'm in no rush, and there's no way I'll put another piece of their sushi into my mouth. I guess I learned my lesson; some fusion places are bound to be as scattered as their menu.",Restaurant
EDUUvzqbOA_36I8hgy_biQ,KeuwC8E1238SP6xyKpBM6w,fZM_o3kKZ9mR-1pvBeow8A,2007-12-13,"Retailopolis - that's an urban slang word I coined when I moved to Phoenix nearly two years ago. You see, no such thing exists where I'm from. Sure, you'll find your traditional mall and the occasional plaza in Oklahoma City, but nothing like a Tempe Marketplace that is a mini-world of consumerism. 

But, out of all the outrageous retail developments I've seen, this is my favorite of its kind. (I can't, for some reason, stand Desert Ridge or Mesa Riverview.) Perhaps it's the design or even the landscaping, but I admit I am drawn here. Not because I have to go to every single store (I don't even know all of what's here), but because out of all the the places to shop, this one stresses me out the least. It's true!

I guess I should admit the fact that I don't really like shopping. And I hate malls. So, yes, this is a pretty big deal: 3 stars from me for a Retailopolis. 

In any case, here's a couple reasons I'd go here:

*Barnes & Noble - Every big development needs a huge book store. Sure, it's not your mom and pop's establishment, but it's books, music, magazines, maps and everything else you want to distract yourself with, including coffee and amazing deserts (a few from Cheesecake Factory). Try the PB Cookie, though. It's my fave.

*World Market - Ah, the wine you'll find here! Prices are reasonable and the selection is great. Organized by country, you'll be able to, in the matter of minutes, explore the world of wine. They sell some of my faves here, including Acacia, Row Eleven, Sexto. Plus, you'll be able to explore other brands that offer new alternatives, including Mark West. If wine's not your thing, check out the beer selection. While limited, it may surprise you with some of what they offer. As for everything else, I could take it or leave it. After all, if I wanted candles or dinner sets, I'd shop elsewhere. 

*Target - Sure as hell beats Wal-Mart, which I haven't stepped foot in for over 4 years. C'mon, it's the ""upscale discounter."" Need I say more?

There are so many other stores here, too, including Old Navy, Ross and JC Penny. Not to mention they've built restaurants around the area for hungry shoppers. Only, instead of seeing a hoard of mediocre pubs, I'm excited to see there's a place that offers sushi and one that offers tea. (Kabuki and Tea Infusion, respectively.)

Of course, maybe I spoke too soon. For if you visit the Web site, you'll see the plans for development, which includes more places to dine and several more stores, including Wet Seal, Hot Topic, Buckle, Levi's and Sam's Club. (Ugh. I hate anything Sam Walton....)

Yes, there is a Dave & Buster's here, if that's your thing. It's an okay time. Just don't expect to stumble into anything you wouldn't find at Desert Ridge. 

What else? 
Oh yes, the music. When you get out of your car, you instantly hear music playing throughout the parking lot. It varies, from Matchbox 20 to tunes you'd hear at a lounge. 

Even better, every Third Thursday of the month, they offer free live music. (This was also the place for the SoCo Music Experience, which was free admission with great acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and Cold War Kids). 

I admit it, I do like this place. My only beef would be 1. Traffic and 2. Parking.  It seems they could have done a better job of engineering the traffic flow and organizing the parking lots to reduce the amount of confused stops and cross-traffic turns as possible. But, hey, that's just me thinking down the road - when people begin to swarm this place and neglect to turn their attention on their driving, instead of the racks and aisles of clothes and goodies awaiting them.

For me, that's the biggest turn-off. You see, this place offers SO much, it's going to be a mad house, no matter what day or time you go. I've gone in the middle of the afternoon and was shocked to see the parking lot packed with vehicles. So, while I may want to go here, I probably won't. I just can't deal with swarms of shoppers. That's the entire reason I avoid malls and do most of my shopping online. Blasted! But sometimes it's fun to go wander around stores and stumble into a new shirt of pair of pants you can't live without... 

Come to think of it, why can't people leave a good thing alone? Must there be a Restaurant Row with 10 different places to grab a bite? Must there be stores stacked upon stores stacked upon stores? I mean, it's such a turn-off to know that you're going to have to deal with a ridiculous amount of people on any given day... and that you can't enjoy just walking around the area, exploring boutiques and shops you've never seen. You're always going to be dodging ""crazy shopping people"" and ""big lady purses."" Ugh. Just thinking about that makes me want to hide.

When in doubt, arm yourself with a map before you venture here.

Early on we went ahead and purchased the $100 yearly membership.  The concept is great, pay the small fee and enjoy a wealth of board games at your leisure.  The selection of games is great, and most of the staff know the rules to most of them and are willing to explain to new groups.  If you haven't been, definitely give it a try!

Where it unfortunately falls apart is atmosphere and service.  I reeeeeally wanted this to be our local haunt, somewhere we could get together regularly and enjoy drinking and playing games.  But the environment that is created between the atmosphere and the service just makes it uncomfortable once the novelty of the games wears off.  When you realize that you could go out and get a new game between your group for the table fee alone, not to mention save yourself from overpriced drinks and snacks, you realize how important atmosphere is, and for our friend group, it just wasn't worth it.   Once again, I really want this place to succeed, so I'm going to make this review a list of suggestions to management rather than complaints, as I would love to see the place thrive.

-The florescent lights and lack of music can make the room feel very sterile.  Some light tavern music and atmospheric lighting would go a very long way to make it more inviting.  
-I'm ok with spending $6 or $7 on a beer every once in a while, but when I do, I would like the glass to be filled to the brim.  I've never been to a bar that deprives me of an ounce or so on my drink every time.
-It consistently took 20-30 minutes from the time we wanted to leave to the time we actually left.  The checkout process needs to be streamlined.
-The following are subpoints under the point: LOOSEN UP.
   +A few of the staff would recognize us and call us by name, but we would still be ID'ed    Every. Single. Time.  This feels awkward.  What are you expecting when you look at it?
   +It also feels very weird to have to be seated in a place that is like a bar in every other respect.  
   +The wait staff just has never felt comfortable or inviting, and they always seem overwhelmed when it is busy.  This could be either training or hiring practices, but something needs to give when we wait 10+ minutes for a water refill most of the time.  There were multiple times when I would have ordered another beer but nobody came for a long stretch.
-It was cool to have reasonably priced salty snacks to eat while we drank.  Then the prices went up.  Then you guys started serving soup.  We laughed on the way home at the price vs. portion ratio.  Its just ridiculous.  If you don't serve food, you need to allow outside food in.  Also, for the love of Pete, let my friend bring his water bottle in.  I promise its not vodka.

This list probably seems petty, but this type of place is getting more popular, and these things are going to make or break the business in the midst of competition.  I wish you the best of luck, and I'll probably be back soon to check it out!",Shopping
S8XtOhI4NLzzZYgpq6Te8A,brId41j7j8I9dnHWBLzWfQ,7z2x16M7IuG8KPfMsyVrKA,2016-03-29,"We had:

Lamb meatballs - not bad but not great

Foie Gras - excellent, but really small (one baguette slice spread with foie gras)

Crab butter and tarragon churro - awesome

Chorizo - good but simple (as in I'd make that at home next time with parma's chorizo)

Morcilla - ok, soft and loose texture that I didn't expect

Conchinillo - inedible

Red sangria - different, not bad

Syrah Rose on tap - meh

We were disappointed in our meal at Morcilla.  The service was well paced; we finished dinner in a reasonable amount of time, though there were spurts and lags, but this is expected in a tapas restaurant.  The seating was extra uncomfortable; we must be getting old because sitting on a hard seat with no padding for 2 hours really started to bother us.  The cocktails disappointed, and the food varied in quality from excellent to inedible.  Unfortunately, the excellent small plate (crab butter and tarragon churro) was quickly forgotten when our $45 platter (conchinillo) intended for 2 people proved to be inedible. 

The quarter sized medallions of meat at the end of each chop were quite tasty, but you literally couldn't chew the rest of it.  The 'crispy skin' had obviously been recooked, leaving the skin so hard that you were afraid you would crack a tooth on it, so no yummy fried skin for us (a tragedy).  The fact that they hadn't cooked it slowly enough to break down the tough tissue meant you missed out on all those bites that blur the lines between meat and fat; oh yeah, it also meant that your double sized entrée consisted of...5 bites of meat!?  The 3 sauces served with it were ok - the salsa verde had tarragon in it, which I love, elevating it to excellent.  The rustic bread was darkly toasted, which wouldn't have been a problem if the rest of the dish wasn't so hard to chew, but we had no energy left in our jaws.  When the server came by to ask how it was, we responded 'it's really tough'.  She nodded, replying, 'it's tough?' (to which we nodded vigorously), and she walked away never to mention it again.  Thanks for caring...  

There was nothing on the cocktail list that called to us, and we weren't impressed with the sangria or the wine we had, so we didn't order more drinks, which kept our check down to $110.  Unfortunately, despite ordering slightly more than typically recommended (based on our double sized entrée), I had to pull out the snacks as soon as we got home. 

Ok, the conchinillo...I want to be fair...I'm sure this dish would be extremely difficult to cook, particularly in a restaurant setting.  Honestly, I don't know what they were going for; Severino is a butcher and a chef, so I'm really confused.  I believe this was basically 1\/3 of a suckling crown roast, except with the full rib attached, grilled and cut into chops.  I've never heard of cooking a suckling pig hard and fast - way too much collagen, etc.  (though I am no chef and don't get much suckling pig, so what do I know?)  Maybe the chef tried to jump the shark on this one, but why does it stay on the menu? 

The only reasonable conclusion I can make (because incompetence doesn't seem reasonable) is that I'm an idiot and totally misunderstood, that they really only intended you to eat the tenderloin\/ribeye medallions (and maybe that's all that's edible for a suckling pig, I mean really, how often do you eat suckling pig?).  But that isn't enough for 1 person, much less 2, and what about the ribs (waste the ribs? really?? Is this true?).  And that does not excuse the skin; let's not forget that they ruined the skin.  Maybe our server misunderstood what was actually edible on the plate when describing the size of the dish.  Maybe we got the tail end of the pig, making those bites pitifully small.  Regardless, this was a total waste, and I'm talking about the animal, not my money (though that was sad too).  Even I, the unrepentant foie gras eater, lamented the little piggy that gave his life for 5 bites of meat.",Restaurant

Sen has 4 1\/2 stars with over 100 reviews.  It's Michelin rated.  What it doesn't have is food to match.  

Our party of five was eager to try what was purportedly one of the best sushi restaurants in town.  We drove all the way from Hendo - in rush hour traffic - just to eat here.  On the way, we decided that we should do the omakase and let the chef put his best foot forward.  Here's what was served:

1.  Yellowtail with peppers and garlic chip - the presentation was wonderful, but the flavors were overpowering.  The ponzu was too strong for such a subtle fish.  The addition of garlic and a spicy habanero (or jalapeno?) just kills any chance you can taste the fish, let alone feel the texture of it while your mouth burns.  

2.  Mizuna salad with salmon, tuna and albacore - This would have been a nice dish, had it come before the spice of the yellowtail.  In fact, this is how good, fresh fish should be served: with very little detraction.  As an individual dish, however, I'd rather just have thick cuts of sashimi instead of thin cuts of fish with a salad on the side.  

3.  Soy Miso Block Cod - really good execution of one of my favorites.  Only downside was that I didn't have a bowl of rice to go with it.  By itself, it was supremely tasty and buttery.

4.  Fliet Mignon tataki - this was good and tender, but lost in sauce.  Fliet has zero flavor profile, so covering it with any sauce really just makes the meat a sauce delivery vehicle.  Chalk it up to personal preference. Also a personal preference: I would really have liked it to be medium RARE rather than medium well.  

5.  Miso soup with clams - delicious.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The combination of clams and miso just hit the rights notes or flavor and smell.  Really good stuff.  I could have just had a couple bowls of this with miso cod and called it a night.

6.  Nigiri - The fish looked and tasted fresh, but the texture of the salmon was slightly mushy.  The rice was really good, with just the right about of koshi that makes me happy.  +1 for the rice.

7.  Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream - I love green tea ice cream and this didn't disappoint.  The souffle, however, was another matter.  It was hard and nowhere near as fluffy or light as it should be.  IMHO, if you offer it on your menu, you need to execute it well or don't bother.

Being hungry after all that, we ordered two additional rolls:

8.  #24 (Shrimp tempura with tuna on top with pineapple wasabi) - This is one of my least favorite rolls...ever.  The sushi itself probably was good, but the sauce killed any chance me wanting to take another bite.  It was too sweet and too much of it all over the roll.  

9.  #25 California roll with soft shell crab - this one at once pretty good and also fairly standard.  I'd probably choose this if I didn't know what else to try.

I liked this place, but it's a tough sell at 4 stars.  Out of 9 items, only 2 stood out as things I would make it a point to order again.  

I've read the reviews.  I've heard the raves.  I finally tried Sen.  I just don't get what the fuss is all about.",Restaurant

Food: 2.5 (out of 5)

Overall: 1.5
 
SERVICE:
Let's start with the main reason why this place left such a disappointing and bad taste in our mouths: BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

It honestly does not matter to me if the food tastes heavenly and is at a Michelin-star level (which it did not, in this case), if a restaurant cannot even get the basics of customer service right. I mean, when you dine out at a restaurant, you are not simply there to enjoy the food; it is an entire package that you are paying for. They don't call it the hospitality industry for nothing.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by three different hosts at the same time, and felt a bit ambushed as all three were talking to me at the same time. I arrived at 7:05pm for our reservation at 7:00pm. I found my friend who was already sitting and waiting by the front, and joined her, but neither of us were told how much longer the wait would be, as if they were happily complacent to get us off their chests, without having to deliver a table in the moment that we greeted each other. The various hosts proceeded to assist others who had shown up after us, and brought them to their tables, without any communication or response as to why we were not seated yet in a dining room full of empty tables. By now, it was 7:15. We were finally seated around 7:30 by the male host in glasses, which would have made sense if they had apologized for the long wait time or some kind of valid explanation, but again, nothing was communicated.

We ordered two appetizers, and two mains to share amongst us: Bone Marrow, Fried Brussel Sprouts, Lamb Sirloin, and Torched Salmon.

Throughout the meal, even when there was food left on the plate, we were constantly greeted by different waitresses who wanted to clear our plates, and kept asking if we were done, or still working on them. This is one of my biggest pet peeves, when dining out. If the food still has food on it, stop coming around every 2 minutes, asking if we're done. We are clearly not done. By the fourth time, we had to stop and take a look behind us to see if there was a lineup out the door (there was no one waiting), as we felt we were being rushed and kicked out.

Finally, the worst part of the meal was at the end when we were all paying for our bills separately. Our waitress, Joyce, left us, quite unprofessionally, mid-service to deal with another table, so I helped my friend click on the same amount on the machine, so we could speed up the process, as our waitress was still not back, to assist. We all had our receipts confirming payment sitting on the table, when she finally came back to take the machines away, along with the four merchant copies of receipts.

Two minutes later, she came back all stern and accusatory-looking, and said, ""I believe one of you didn't pay. I'm missing one of your payments."" We were shocked that she said that, when all of us clearly paid, and showed her our receipts one by one. And she literally went through our credit card numbers and invoice numbers one by one, out loud, in an accusatory tone. This was hilarious to me, because one of our friends was asked if she wanted a copy of the receipt and she said, ""No,"" but now we were questioned on why we didn't have them all. I felt like we were being interrogated in a police station, rather than sitting in a supposedly nice restaurant in the middle of Main Street, Unionville. Joyce went away to further investigate, and came back realizing her mistake. However, rather than starting with ""Sorry,"" we were reprimanded for trying to help her out by continuing the payment process. Isn't the number one rule of customer service is that 'the customer is always right,' especially in the sense that you should definitely NOT be blaming the customer for your own mistake? 

FOOD:
In terms of the food, we all agreed it was decent, edible, but not amazing or as extraordinary as social media had depicted, which was the most disappointing part, especially when our waitress, Joyce, upsold and claimed the particular menu items we ordered were ""...the most popular and so good, as you can probably see all over Instagram."" 

The Lamb Sirloin (CAD$24) was a perfect example of this 'Expectation vs. Reality' disappointment. The restaurant's own IG handle posted a delicious-looking full-sized plate of lamb sirloin pieces with cauliflower, sundried tomato, almonds, hummus, fresh basil, arugula and pomegranate.  Clearly, our much smaller dish looked quite different, with: very FEW pieces of burnt-tasting cold BBQ lamb, cherry tomato halves instead of sundried tomato, no almonds, no basil, and no pomegranate. We pretty much got half of what the menu listed, and the plate looked like half the version of what they show on Instagram. 

Overall, service was terrible and food was overhyped and disappointing.",Restaurant

 I want to change the tires on my mountain bike.  I was after hybrid\/street tires to replace the thick off-road tires which waste far more energy than they should due to high friction levels.  For an urban commuter, thinner, smoother tires are the way to go.   I spent about 10-15 minutes in the store before leaving completely disappointed.

As a recently converted cyclist, I am constantly in search of improved gear, nicer bikes, and upgrades of all kinds. I bought a cheap used bike from Bike Pirates on Bloor St W [Which I highly recommend for anyone interested in cycling and not blow the bank in the process.]

First, I walked past rows and rows of bikes in the retail area of the shop straight to the service department in the back.  There is a reception area in the service department surrounded by glass cases of gear, plus things on the walls\/shelves.  There are doorways leading to two rooms; an office and the other looked like the service area. 
I stood in reception for about 5 minutes - no one came out to ask if they could help me. I even gazed inquisitively into the office, and the people clearly saw me - still didn't come out.  

I figured: ""Fine, if they don't want my business, I'll take it somewhere else."" From what I saw of the parts in the service area, things were extremely pricey in this shop anyways.  Tires for  $70 each.   Axles for $150, $200 and up.

My entire bike cost $80 at Bike Pirates!  Yikes.

Anyways, I left the non-service department and had a look at the bikes for the pure joie du vivre. This is a uber high-end bike shop.  They had alot of really nice bikes.  Their entry level bikes were about $500-600, and the cheapest one in the shop was about $450.  The nice ones cost well over $1000.  
While I was there, I noticed a staff member helping out a lady who was obviously interested in getting into biking. Although I may be rushing to judgment, her physique led me to guess she was not a seasoned cyclist but rather an entry level, ""let's try a new hobby"" type person.  Commendable, and I'm all for it.  However, the bike he had her trying out cost like $1200!  A price tag big enough  to discourage or bankrupt even the best-intentioned prospective cyclist.

I was really disappointed this shop had nothing to offer the entry-level cyclist, or value-oriented consumer. 

When I decided to get back into cycling as an adult, I bought something cheap.  I wasn't sure how well it would work out with my lifestyle, and my commute to work [about 7km each way through fairly heavy traffic areas].  I've subsequently found that I like it very much, and in the future I will easily spend $500-$700 on a bicycle.  We spend that much to ride the disgusting TTC for 5 months anyways, right?  But the point is, that's helluva lot to spend on a hobby if you're not certain it's for you.

I suppose shops like this have their purpose, but for someone interested in value and good service - keep looking.

FYI: Later on that day, I stopped into a couple of shops on Bloor W between Lansdowne and Dufferin, and the staff were far more helpful and prices more reasonable.  Tonnes of nice bikes for less than $600.  Also, fair prices on tires - $20 each.  Plus the staff actually had time to acknowledge my existence.  A big plus.

FYI*** Updated:  I ended up going to Mountain Equipment Co-op the next weekend, and was extremely pleased with the outcome.  The tires were about $11 each, and they only charged $5 per tire to install ($37 including tax).  No waiting, they were able to do it in less than a half hour.  I highly recommend going to MEC for any bike needs or other hobbies.  I find their products are good quality, and also good value.  Plus their staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Also, the guy who worked on my bike told me that by the spring MEC is going to be selling their own brand of bikes.  Yay!  Good value and amazing quality.  No rip-offs here.",Shopping
20Af2cnb5R0pAu3QprlnKw,TeojE74vCzj-t7veiBqH0Q,IN3ysgB0iD2BuLf9eXqx_A,2015-02-08,"It is hard to pick how many stars for this ""resort"" because it is not really a resort, but rather a  hotel, so if they are calling themselves a resort I would say it is 2 stars, but as a mid priced hotel, I would probably give it 3 stars, so I settled on 3 as there are a lot of things I do like about this place, but just because they have suites, pools, bars and restaurants doesn't make it a true resort.   I have heard they will argue this point, but believe me, I travel for a living and know the difference.  

Now for my stay:  I have stayed here in the past in the townhouse type rooms and loved them because when I stay with someone else, I like being able to have more than one room.  It seems everyone I travel with snores, so the townhouses are great so someone can sleep downstairs and the other upstairs.  This trip it was just me, so I didn't want to pay for or really need the upgraded big townhouse, so I got the standard room and boy is there a big difference.      My biggest complaint is the insanely outdated fan\/air conditioner. I don't remember this in the townhouse, so not sure if those units are updated with quieter systems or maybe it was in a different room  then the one I was sleeping in, so I didn't hear it.  
 I am not kidding when I tell you this thing sounds like a mac truck is coming through the window.   It is ridiculously loud.  It constantly turns on and off throughout the night and every time it starts up, it jolted me awake.  Several people at the pool were joking about it as well, so it is not just me being a light sleeper.   One guy said he just turned it off and sweated the whole night as that was the better option.  These things need updated bad.  Having several nights of constantly interrupted sleep is something that is not acceptable to me, so I won't stay in these rooms again solely based on that.  It is frustrating to pay for a room and not get a decent nights sleep.  I almost checked out after the first night, but I didn't have time to get online and research another hotel and it was prepaid, so I figured I could handle one more night.
The tub in the bathroom looked like it was from the 70's as well, but that isn't a huge deal, unless you are expecting a ""resort"" type room, but just saying, that really needs to be updated too.
Second big complaint is NO fridge or mini bar in these rooms.    When you are in the desert, most people like to have cold water, soda, beer, something, but these rooms do not have a fridge and I couldn't find a vending machine anywhere.  Only option is to go to the store and buy what you want and then  get ice from the ice machine and ice down each one at a time in the ice bucket as the ice melts.  Also,  a lot of people eat out and have left overs, but you can't bring those back as there is no fridge to keep them in.   Not exactly a resort type experience.   PUT A FRIDGE IN EACH ROOM PLEASE.   ( I saw another review that you can call and request a fridge, but they charge you for it..... nope not paying extra for something that should already be in every ""resort's""  rooms in the first place.)
At least get mini bars in these rooms so if I want a cold water or Sprite I don't have to get up and drive to a Circle K.    
Now for the good things.   Pools are great and I love they are open late and you can get food and drinks at the pool.  All the staff was nice, especially the girl who serves you at the pool in the afternoon.    They have nice tennis courts and they do an immaculate job keeping the grounds looking great.  This place is huge, so that is no easy thing to do.  
The key here is to know this is not a 4 or 5 star Resort and not have those expectations.  It is usually worth the price they charge, which is why it is so much lower than other true resorts in the area.  You get what you pay for and this place usually has good rates for what you get..   
Just remember those air conditioners are super loud, so unless you are a very, very hard sleeper, this may be a deal breaker for staying in the standard rooms.",Beauty
4xBIMfoeR5II3T3Nlhlr1A,HUi6hERzzRz63_qLOETeeA,Eg_M8eeu9SDEdbP7iUmVbQ,2011-11-14,"I was headed to a computer lab around lunchtime today when I noticed the building lit up at the edge of Schenley Park in Oakland -- was it open?  Having seen the construction progress along throughout the spring and summer months, I was anxious to sit down and give this brand spanking new restaurant a try.

First surprise: it is NOT a full-service restaurant.  When I walked in, I was promptly greeted and two hostesses handed me a menu.  They directed me to go to the register when I was ready to order.
The menu looked fresh, seasonal, and original, and consisted of salads, sanwiches, soup, and wood-fired pizzas.  All of the sandwiches come with either greens or crispy taters with curry ketchup -- more on that later.  

I finally settled on a sandwich -- The Roasted Pig -- pork roast, carmelized onions, ricotta, and red pepper aioli, and I wanted to try both of the sides so I asked for the greens and paid for a side of the crispy taters.  In all, my meal was around $13.  If I had gotten anything to drink other than water I imagine it would have topped $15.  They gave me a number with my order, as they bring the food to your table.

Second surprise: The ""water bar.""  I just wanted water with lunch and the girl who took my order pointed me towards a spot on the bar with two larges containers of water -- one with cucumbers and one with lemon.  You can help yourself to all you like of either.  The flavored water was a nice touch.

The Porch is seat yourself, and I found a table with a great view of the park and a bench seat -- it was roomy and comfortable.

I waited about 10 minutes for my food to arrive, and the greens looked fresh and bright, the bread was crisp and chewy at the same time, and the potatoes looked divine.

First thing to try: the greens.  They were tasty and clearly very fresh, if a little bit on the salty side.  I'm not sure WHAT they are tossed in, but it was light and tasty.  (I hate when I go to a restaurant and they give me OLD greens\/lettuce in my salad, it is such a huge turnoff!)  

Next: A bite of those potatoes.  The crispy taters weren't exactly what I expected them to be -- the work tater put ""tater tots"" into my brain, but these were fresh, small potatoes, diced kind of like homefries and seasoned.  And on the side was the curry ketchup.  Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE curry: the curry ketchup is GENIUS!  The curry gives a little kick of spice and a something extra to the ketchup, and the seasoned potatoes, while good by themselves, were really something special with a dab of the curry ketchup on them.  Note: If you're not a fan of curry, you CAN request regular ketchup.

And then my sandwich: I can't claim it was a flavor explosion in my mouth, but the bread was toasted just the right amound and the onions were sweet and tasty.  The pork was flavorful and the texture was spot-on.  It wasn't really messy, althought the last couple bites kind of fell apart a bit and the cheese didn't stay on the sandwich well...  Speaking of which, I couldn't really taste the cheese (although the type of cheese on the sandwich was a mild one), so the one thing I would change if I were making the sandwiches would be to use a sharper, ""stickier"" cheese that would also help hold the sandwich together.

Someone came by and refilled my water glass several times throughout my meal and another person took my plate away when I was done eating.  The staff was friendly and attentive and no one acted like they were just there to do a job.  

While I didn't have any alcoholic beverages, there was a beer and wine list and The Porch also makes fresh seasonal soda to order.

Overall, a nice place, and definetly somewhere I would take a friend for a casual lunch.",Restaurant
SynwsdIaFAASa87kmP2i8A,eZC0wa1DdxYXprV_BUehLg,RVTxiiWQwmeSJonJgYwwWg,2013-05-13,"On one hand, Teres is gorgeously set up, very clean, and gives you a very upscale first impression... I would go so far as to say that its vibe is the nicest spot for nails in Old Town without going to a hotel\/resort and certainly should appeal to that whole bridal party\/birthday demographic.  I also respect the fact that they do something a little different and have all sorts of unique options available for you.

On the other hand... it also makes me feel cheap.  In order to get a solid pedicure I have to ramp up the basic option by piling on extras via the ala carte ""bar tab"".   We aren't talking Patties dive bar tab style, no we're talking drinks-at-the-pool-at-the-W bar tab price point.   Not to say the drinks at the W aren't worth every penny or that I actually enjoy Patties (where dreams go to die, but that is a whole different story).  Im just saying how do I end up spending 50 bucks a pop and not even get a real foot massage with my somewhat decent polish job?  In fact I've also felt rushed out the door almost every time, and since there isn't a dryer of any sort for the pedicure crew, it always makes for some cringeworthy touch and go moments.  Which then leads me down the inevitable road... why did I just spend $50 dollars to feel pressured, rushed, nervous, anxious, and lastly like my money doesn't spend the same.

Case in point, the first time I came in I did not get offered this little survey card thingy.  I didn't know I was missing out until another afternoon Friday treat, I brought a friend for her first time and on the way out she got offered some future discount if she filled it out.  I immediately asked for one, not for the 5 dollars off or whatever incentive it was... If the 5 dollars mattered that much I shouldn't be getting a pedicure in the first place, but because I genuinely wanted to comment on a few things in the spirit of fairness.  I got told only first time clients get them.  I re-clarified, you can keep the discount I just want to share some feedback.  No dice, sorrrrrry. well huh. 

Here is what I would have said (verbatim what I typed into my iphone notes while I was getting the pedi I might add):

Great job bringing a fun spot like this to the area, it's needed.  A couple things I've noticed having been here a few times: some of the nail techs can be a bit uptight or seem like they are in an argument with each other and as I have gotten this vibe on every visit it would seem its not just one off day (it has also spilled onto trying to have a pleasant conversation with whomever I'm with), I would recommended having a dryer of some sort or an area for people to relax and let their feet dry... especially if you guys are busy and you need them out of their seat immediately but they aren't dry or their friends aren't done, and lastly I am coming here to treat myself and relax and with the level of the establishment you are going for... having to ask if there are any options for refreshment (sometimes repeatedly) makes me already feel like I'm imposing.  All that being said, thank you for your hard work & creative drive!

Now everyone has to see it.

The last experience tipped me over the edge, you don't want my money... ok I'll try other places.  What is taking this review back up to 3 stars is recently after trying to make last minute appointments everywhere in town besides Teres with an out of town visitor, I caved when she kept pulling ya'll up on Yelp.  You nicely accommodated us and with the exception of her pedicure taking 20-30 minutes longer than mine so I had to bounce around like musical chairs trying to not be in the way... it was actually a pleasant experience and my toes still look great.  The employee that took care of me was awesome, she's blond and always has cool glittery eye makeup, and she made me feel relaxed for once. 

I will try Teres again... maybe one of these amazing acrylic-gel manis I keep hearing about (that is if you'll still have me for being a grump here) as I really do like the concept, but for now... a ok it is.  No shame in that.",Beauty

Why aren't ""Wrigley Mansion (Club)"" and ""Geordie's"" separate listings? It's gummed up.

ONE. WRIGLEY MANSION: 

""Shoooooow me the way to go home, I'm tired and I wanna go to bed.... I had a little drink about an hour ago and it's gone right to my head.... wherever I may roam, on land or sea or foam... you can always hear me singin' this song....show me the way to go home!""

Wrigley Mansion is my home!

I feel like I'm in my Grandma's house in Chicago. Or...singin' along in our best falsetto with the player piano in Leslie F.'s basement, like a couple of after-Catholic-school-fifth-grade-lunatics-still-in-our-plaid-skirts at 3pm on Tuesday.  ""Shoooow me the way to go home..."" Man, weren't we rebellious?  Fifth graders singing out songs about drinking. 

But what does all that have to do with the Mansion? 

I like the view, the lights, the lions. I like the ceilings, the railings, the Lincoln. I like the rooms, the history, the man. And just like the Hormel Family (who now owns the place) ...I love the player piano. It's a 1929 Steinway - one of two remaining - and it's the reason that, when the Mansion was up for sale ... the Hormel Family purchased it. When Wrigley died, he willed the piano to the house - the two shall never be parted. You want the piano? Welcome home!

On our most recent tour of the Mansion -thank you, legal beagles from NM for letting us partake of your par-tay ;) (btw, great venue for events) - the piano played its ""Rhapsody in Blue."" It's still  functional and has the original twelve rolls with which it was sold. I'll spare additional details...it's worthy of your visit. (Website has tour info and about why it's a ""Club"" and at what level of membership you may wish to join.) 

As for the mansion: resist the urge to compare to ""other mansions"" from an opulence standpoint. This, by the way, was the smallest of his many homes - he only spent a couple weeks a year here.  If you're from Chicagoland, I think you'll have a natural appreciation for the ""Midwest man"" who came to the desert, who loved (tile from) Catalina Island...who, if he was in it to ""wow"" the neighbors - he probably did it considering this was completed at the height of the Depression. (Hey, if you own these 10 acres, this lovely hilltop and the Biltmore, not to mention a ball team and a most of an island...isn't that enough?) The whole Mansion is worthy of your visit. 

TWO. as for GEORDIE's - bar and restaurant located in the Mansion...as far as the food goes, I'm not as sure...

""William Wrigley Jr. died here January 26, 1932 of ""acute indigestion."" as reported by the ""Phoenix Gazette"" in a newspaper clipping that is framed and hung in the upstairs hallway. 

Eat at Geordie's and you'll suffer the same fate as Wrigley Jr!? Irony. Just some fun facts and decidedly not since my husband safely consumed his steak. However, I didn't risk it when up against the ""Frutti del Mar."" Bad clams? I don't know...couldn't find 'em. Or was that the mussels? It was both. I've never had a shellfish so far outta the shell. The ones that were still in the shell were shriveled and unappetizing.  The manager was a perfect combo of personable and professional and between him and the awesome bartender, all was made right. ""Service recovery"" truly counts in the service industry and while the food was not right for me, the service was exceptional. 

(Note, I've taken creative liberties here as ""Geordie's"" was not around (of course) when Wrigley lived here - he had a kitchen staff and all that. Geordie's is named after Geordie Hormel - not only heir to the Hormel Family but also a musician and recording studio proprietor - who died in Paradise Valley, AZ in 2006 - of, I'm assuming, probably not indigestion.) (And upon further research, I find it's ""Geordie"" himself who purchased the mansion so I'll have to get my facts straighter. More questions for the tour guide.) 

I'd hate to hate on Geordie's, so we'll shelve the restaurant main courses and, at a later date, tiptoe back in with appetizers and so forth, but as for the bar area...

With an array of seating outdoors overlooking the Valley, a nice indoor bar area with television and a ""library"" adjacent... with wines around $9-15 per glass (discounted at happy hour) and fun libations evoking Wrigley (""Doublemint Mojito""), the bar is definitely up to snuff! That means that... 

There'll come a point where ""you can (still) always hear me singin' this song...",Restaurant
rpfiE3UzifwlFV4adm6Qow,buueHGzeDJOYSSE_yusvRA,t8bVDK44l8xXzv6B6L2vDQ,2017-07-08,"Yikes, I am so sad to write this review as I had read all the previous reviews of this store and was excited to give them my business. However, unfortunately I just had the most UGLY interaction with the store owners and feel like I need to share this with others. 

I purchased a pair of new size 39 black sandals (product code 250 L8 M6) from this store on June 12th and paid $113. When I bought the shoes an older gentleman who told me he owned the store with his mother assisted me and the interaction was very pleasant. I tried on a couple of pairs and was happy with my purchase. I left a happy customer and actually told a couple of friends about the good service I had received and the great prices in the store. 

Over the next few weeks I wore the sandals and began to break them in. This process was as was expected. I didn't do anything abnormal in the sandals, I wore them around normal day to day activities in the city. After around 2 weeks I started to notice that at the inner side near my big toe the sandals were starting to tear on both shoes and then I also noticed the same at the top of the shoe (above the Birkenstock stamp). The exact same thing was happening on both shoes, and I hadn't got the shoes caught in something or anything like that, which told me that this was a problem with the leather and the shoes were likely defective. I was disappointed about this as breaking the shoes in had been a fairly uncomfortable (but not surprising) process. 

I returned to Village Shoe Boutique today, July 8th, and the same man who had served me and his mother were both in the store. I explained what had happened and they both told me that they had never seen this happen before. I acknowledged this and explained that it seemed like this pair were an odd defective pair, that I was very happy with the shoes apart from this fault, and would just like to exchange them for the same pair. When I said this they both became defensive, telling me to contact Birkenstock directly because they had never seen anything like this. I stated that I would prefer to exchange them at this store as this was where I had purchased them. They then offered to exchange them only if I paid an additional $50. I explained that I wasn't willing to do this as the shoes were faulty and it should not be my responsibility to pay additional money because of this. 

They then became very hostile, and said that this wasn't the fault of the shoe and that it was obvious that they had been ""cut"" by someone with a pair of scissors. I asked if they were serious and said that of course this was not what had happened. They said ""yes you cut these, you can see, it's obvious"". I then summarized what they were telling me - that they were accusing me of buying a pair of brand new shoes, spending time breaking them in, then deciding to cut them myself with a pair of scissors, and returning to the store to ask for an exchange for the same shoes. They said ""maybe you didn't cut them, but someone else cut them"". I said this was ridiculous. They both became increasingly hostile and told me to contact Birkenstock directly. The man began to give me the phone number and I explained that I would call Birkenstock while in the store so that the company could speak to me and the store owners who had sold me the shoes at the same time. When I said this, they told me to go online to find the number and to get out of the store. I replied that I would certainly be going online and letting people know about this experience. 

There were a couple in the store watching and listening to what was going on. I turned to them and recommended that they don't purchase from the store and the woman told me to ""shut up"" and told the couple not to listen to me. The couple said I wasn't bothering them and that I should be able to speak and say what I wanted. At this, the female store owner grabbed my arm and began to pull me to the front door. At this point they were screaming and yelling at me. I told her to get her hands off of me or I would call the police. I left the store and stood outside shaking.  

I am in disbelief at this whole interaction. I was initially disappointed about the faulty shoes but this horrendous customer experience brought the whole incident to another level. I am contacting Birkenstock directly in the hopes that the organization, as a supplier to the store,  is able to provide me with some assistance. 

Sadly, I would HIGHLY recommend NOT buying anything at this store.",Shopping

I can't compare it to any place in Austin, Dallas or Lubbock.  But I have taste buds.  And they liked it.  They liked it a lot.  

I love BBQ.  Sure, there's better and worse BBQ around town based on where ya go, but generally speaking if I go to a BBQ place, I'm going to enjoy myself.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to recommend the place, or come back again, and it really doesn't mean that I'm going to write a review on it.  But as I sit here wondering how I ate that whole freaking sandwich, I know that I have just had one of the best BBQ nights in a long, long time.  And once my stomach isn't full (say, tomorrow afternoon?) I'll be calling friends to plan our next trip there.  

OM-frickin-G it is awesome!  As has been mentioned in other reviews they hooked us up with some samples when we said we hadn't been there before.  Sure, their brisket leaves this taste of buttery meat in your mouth (if you don't understand that, I'm sorry for you) and makes you want much much more - but why has no one mentioned the turkey?  We only got a sample of it, but DANG I could eat a lot of that!  One day when I'm trying to be ""healthy"" I'll get that but today was not that day.

I got what I believe was called the Big ol' Boy sandwich.  When he called back for the guys to make it he said to make a BIg ol' Girl.  Nice touch dude.  So the sandwich is 1\/3 pound each of BBQ chopped pork, brisket and hot links.  I am not a fan of hot links, but figured I'd give it a shot as I liked the general concept (It actually comes out as a sandwich vs. it being a make your own thing...).  I LOVED the hotlinks.  That casing had an awesome ""pop"" as you bit into it, had a black pepper-y hint that I loved, and was good enough that I would almost contemplate trying one solo.  And I have NEVER felt that way about a hot link before.

Between our samples and our meals I got to try all 3 kinds of brisket and I don't know that I'll be able to tell you my favorite.  Like picking a favorite child.  Sure, Bobby is the juiciest, but Jimmy tastes intense and smokey...well, you know what I mean...

Not sure how new this is - but they now have 2 BBQ sauces for your eating pleasure.  Normal and HOT.  Hot won't burn your lip, but definitely makes the tongue to a double take.

And the service.  Clap... Clap... Clap..Clap..Clap.Clap.Clap.Clap!!!  Right on point.  By the end of the end of our introduction to the food we knew what things were made fresh that day, what things were made every other day or weekly, and which ones came from his Grandma's kitchen.  Thank you Grandma - for both the recipes and raising folks right.  Folks were just as sweet as that tea.  

I was also happy to see that even though we got there around 6:20pm and they close at 7pm, there were 3 big parties and 1 to go order that came after us.  Please folks - keep these people busy!  Don't you dare let this place go out of business because I have found my new BBQ heaven.

nMlxDTJ0bzBjy0Plcewd8A,0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,y4ETe3DkcIjjr_eyeg5U5g,2014-02-01,"First off, let me tell you how to find this place. Their address says they are off of East Sahara, but I ended up turning on to Commercial Center Drive on my right going east coming from Las Vegas Blvd. If you hit Maryland Parkway, you have gone too far. They are in the same plaza as The Green Door, Lotus of Siam, and Komol, which is right next to them.

Now that you have found the place, you still kind of have to do a double take when you get to the entrance for there are no indications on the doors themselves. All you can go by is their Cornish Pasty sign at the top of the building.

Now, what is a pasty you ask? According to Wickipedia:
A pasty (\/pæsti\/, Cornish: Hogen; Pasti), (sometimes known in the United States as a pastie or British pasty)[1] is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, the westernmost county in England. It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables, without meat in vegetarian versions, on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal. After baking, the result is a raised semicircular food item.

So now that you know what the technical term is, let me tell you my version, or should I say my good Yelp buddy Chris ""Downtown Chris"" R's version is. Basically, its a gourmet hot pocket, but a hundred times better. Mainly because when you order it, it is made from scratch. When you take that first bite, it's obvious that it did not come from a freezer straight into the microwave. Some people compare it to an empanada. Some think its similar to a chicken pot pie. Whatever you hear, let your own taste buds tell you the truth.

When you first enter the establishment, just the magnificent odor herbs and garlic emanating from the kitchen will tell you that they are whipping up something extraordinary in the kitchen. You have a bar in the middle and you have some pretty good sized tables and benches to comfortably seat your party. The lighting is bit low which could be a good thing for you lovebirds on a first time date or otherwise.

As you check out the menu, you will find that just about every option is mouthwatering. With me, I finally went with the Mexican (8.50). It is Mexican-spiced and simmered steak strips, potatoes, eggs, jalapenos and cheddar. Comes with a side of sour cream and salsa. I also opted for a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese (3.50).

Since me and the wifey were sharing, we were thinking this was enough food. We were wrong. It was more than enough. The Mexican Pasty we ordered was basically a giant hot pocket cut in half. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes came in a medium sized casserole type of bowl with plenty of melted cheese on top of it. This could of been a meal in itself. Needless to say, we had plenty of it left because we were saving room for dessert because my wifey has a sweet tooth.

Again, looking at the dessert menu we were confounded with the delectable options we were gonna have to decide to get. So we ended up getting the Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty (6.00). This concoction has peanut butter, bananas and raspberry jelly whipped cream and raspberry sauce. Comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The best way I can describe this item is that it's like a deep fried peanut butter jelly and banana sandwich topped off with raspberry sauce. Instead of milk you have it in the form of a scoop of vanilla ice cream to wash it down. This was a nice sized item as well and we could only eat half of it. I know my wife was happy for she had something good for lunch the next day.

Service was excellent. Our beverages were constantly filled, food came out in a timely manner, and she answered any and all questions we had with a smile.

Lastly, here are their hours.
Mon-Sat 11 am to 12 am
Sun 11 am to 10 pm

I love the fact that they close at midnight Monday through Saturday because sometimes, you just happen to be hungry around 9 or 10 because you had an early dinner or was forced to eat your in laws cooking, etc. Whatever your reason is, these guys are here for you!

So in closing, I don't normally do a long review. But when I do, its usually a 5 star worthy place and then some! It's not always that you find a place that you can bring your family where you can get great food with generous portions at great prices and great service. I suggest you make your way here because I  guarantee that once this place gets that much more popular, the only complaint you might have would be that you had to wait because the place was packed!

We have a toddler, so first priority in our mind is will it be fun for both adults and the kiddo?  Glad to say that we all had a great time here.  We chose this hotel based on the recommendation of friends with kids, and because they have the Kids Quest daycare on-site.  We never once used the daycare (we stayed in the pool the whole time).  We did go in and look at it though, it looked like a fun place for the kids.  I was only in there briefly, but from what I saw, there were a lot of kids running around and entertaining themselves (a lot of kids were playing in small groups - I guessed they must have been siblings or otherwise known each other).  I didn't see a lot of adult-led activities.  I only saw the room for the bigger kids, I didn't go in the toddler room, which is a separate room at the back of the playarea.  The prices and the hours for the Kids Quest were very reasonable.

The pool was the place to be!  The big pool has a very shallow wade in area, perfect for our little guy.  It was shallow enough that he felt confident walking in on his own and didn't need to be held.  There were tons and tons of kids in the big pool, with lots of splashing and lots of jumping in from the sides and the central fountain.  But if you go back a little ways to one of the adjacent, smaller pools, there weren't too many kids in them or too much noise.  So I think even if you aren't traveling with kids you can find a spot to relax.

We stayed in a regular room, not a suite or anything, and it was plenty big to accomodate a king-sized bed, a seating area, and our pack-n-play.  We also enjoyed the modern decor.  In fact, the whole hotel is really nice.  I am a Facilities Manager; I have a habit that annoys the crap out of my husband of noticing every spot on the carpet, every smudge on the walls, and every burned out lightbulb in a lit sign.  It's my job to notice those details.  I hate staying somewhere where the property is not being properly maintained (hello Flamingo, I'm looking at you!).  I understand that Red Rock has been open for a few years, but in my opinion it looks almost brand new.  I had no problems letting my toddler play on the floor, for instance, because I felt that the carpets were plenty clean.

We enjoyed meals at the Feast (buffet), the Grand Cafe, and Tbones Steakhouse.  We also enjoyed drinks at the Lucky Bar.  The service at each of these venues was not only top-notch but really friendly.  We particularly liked the steakhouse.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly to order, and the service was really attentive.

The service at the pool left something to be desired.  There is an automatic 18% gratuity on everything in the pool area, even if you go to the bar and order yourself (that includes food that you go and order and then you return and pick up at the bar).  The girls working at the pool are a little younger than the average cocktail waitress (maybe 18 as opposed to 25) and have to wear 1\/2 cut or 3\/4 cut bottoms with their butts hanging out, and deal with gross old fat married guys staring at them all day long, and screaming kids, as they walk around in 100+ degree heat.  It isn't Rehab, they aren't looking at hard bodies all day.  Between all of that and a guaranteed gratuity, I can kind of understand why they acted bored most of the time.  

But really, who cares?  You're at the pool and you're on vacation!",Beauty

Two stars for customer service skills, at best.
2.5 stars for the actual repair work experienced.
Clarification; our mantle clock decided ""nada mas"" one day.  Found this shop online, checked out the hours and took it there for a ""look see.""
While this is a quality clock, it is not an antique or heirloom, so our interest was in an evaluation , followed by a phone call with an estimate, to give us the facts prior to green-lighting the repair.
This place is in the ""Front St mall"" area of the Falls, meaning, be prepared  for some hoofing if you are a first timer.
I parked and hoofed it into the shop, where there  were a number of antiquities and curiosities, including the cigarette puffing owner who was not-so-deftly trying to put the watch mechanism back in the case for a customer he was attending.
There were three other customers excluding the writer who were trolling the clogged display area leisurely looking at the available wares, and then there was me.
I stood holding the clock for perhaps ten minutes while the owner labored at his craft for the guy whose watch needed a new battery, while I stood, becoming progressively more uncomfortable and glancing around unsuccessfully trying to find an empty spot on the counter-top, and later anywhere, to place the clock while my patience and his skill were locked in a struggle to the death.
During this time, My presence and predicament both went unacknowledged, and by default unaddressed by the shopkeeper.
I'm thinking when there is a stained glass sign over the entry door which boldly proclaims ""Clock Repair"", that one would have a spot for folks to set down there clock while standing in queue. But I'm ust a GOM, grumpy old man.)

In most similar circumstances, I am the poster-boy for patience. 
However everyone reading this knows the drill here! 
Even without ever having been in a clock repair shop. 

One walks in with clock in-hand, knowing that it will not be fixed while waiting, and that a ticket will be filled out identifying the issue, the name, the phone number, and a spot for comments and the tag will come with a tear-off receipt to prove that indeed you left something there.

One knows that the tag information completion will largely fall on the owner of the clock, following which, one will scoot out the door.

Had the shop owner been a bit more adept at the watch assembly process, I would probably have just waited things out; but the overpowering stench of cigarette smoke was even more annoying than his dexterity level at the task at hand, and I had lost most of the feeling in my arms, so I just excused myself and asked for the tag so I could set the clock on the floor, fill out the tag and, hopefully get out of there before the nausea from the smell bore fruit.
I got the tag, filled it out, (he had a difficult time finding a spot for me to put down the 2' square tag on the counter-top!), instructing on the tag that a call with a cost estimate be made prior to making any repair.  And tore off my receipt.
Hey this is the age of throw away everything, 'cause there is a third world country somewhere that can build a new one cheaper than we can repair an old one! 
If it can be true of refrigerators, surely it can be true of clocks!
So I felt this was a very reasonable request.
Sure enough when the phone call came, he left a message stating the work had been done and to come pick up the clock.
So much for my informed consumerism!

It turned out all the clock needed was cleaned and oiled, so for a crisp new $100 bill, the gent air-cleaned and oiled my clock at which point it began ticking again.
Not exactly the value of the decade, but shy of highway robbery.
Next time I'll buy a can of air for $5, and some clock oil for another $5 and spend the $90 savings on a nice dinner out with my wife.
Hopefully if that produces nausea it  will be from some bad clams, and not the stench of my surroundings!
When I returned to pick up the clock, he had a difficult time finding it in his 500 square-foot shop, and asked if he had called me stating the work was complete?   
Call me a stickler for organization, (and pay no attention whatsoever to the loud cackling noises coming from my wife stage left),  but when the clock repair guy doesn't know where he puts completed work vs.the stuff he is selling, I become ever so slightly disquieted.  
Perhaps during the down hours at the shop, a little organization is in order? 
And hey, while you're at it a HEPA air cleaner can be had for almost exactly what you charged me for cleaning and oiling my clock, how about investing in one? That and a can of Glade, and perhaps the 2\/3rd:s of us that DON""T smoke will be able to stay in your shop long enough to make a purchase without diving outside for air every three minutes!",Shopping
XqagxJziOZLZK49wmGKDGw,SuxGbnuoWtL3kGF1CrF3jw,XwV2-lISDp_5Acy72bA8Qg,2010-05-13,"I recommend this place to anyone who's interested in having a luxurious stay without such a high cost. I've been here a handful of times and at times I prefer coming here than other hotels on the strip. It's an all suite and spa hotel. It's not just a typical suite it consist of it's bed room, huge bathroom w\/ jacuzzi tub, living room (w\/ pull out couch), small patio w\/ seating area and a full kitchen. 

The kitchen might be my favorite part but the jacuzzi tub is also a plus especially after a night of dancing in 5"" heels!! The beautiful kitchen w\/ granite counter tops and a breakfast\/bar table. I've only came here on a girls trip and it's perfect we come here w\/snacks and drinks.The kitchen has necessities available like plates, glasses, and utensils. Although, the restaurant here is fantastic also! Kilawat I believe is the name we've been here for dinner which is fine dining and delicious. The waiters are real nice. I guess since it is the only restaurant in this hotel they aren't uptight we came here for my birthday a few years back right after cleaning up after hitting up the pool. We were uhh I should say unpresentable. But they were nice they served us as any fine dining establishment without the judgyness. Anyway the food was delectable. But this restaurant is my fav for Breakfast!! It's a must!! It's it divine! Fine dining breakfast lol around $20 but it's so good! It's only of the few places I've found that has creme brulee french toast!!! It's amazing and mouth watering! It's moist and custardy like creme brulee with 'burnt sugar' to top. Amazing!! If I don't stay at this hotel I try to come here just for breakfast! And if the creme brulee isn't good enough they have ricotta cheese pancakes w\/ fruit all I can say is wow. It may not seem appetizing as you think of ricotta cheese for lasagna but it leaves the pancakes real moist and so tasty!! Yummmy!! And yes, if I don't make it to the restaurant cause we're either too tired or to busy getting ready or just rather stay in our oh so comfy hotel room we've ordered room service which basically a great menu but they're also willing to make ricotta cheese pancakes or creme brulee french toast from their restaurant which I think is amazing!! I love the personal satisfaction they provide! 

Funny story the last time we were here I think we were the only girls here cause the staff knew us. And not too sure but we got a delivery of beer lol. I guess they must have really liked us. Not too sure who sent us the beer they never did come to get their thanks. But we appreciated it none the less. =)

Anyway, back to the room it has a huge bathrooms that accommodates 5 girls trying to get ready lol. You know that means it's big! 

Another funny story yea so we were 5 girls getting ready which means hair dryers, curling irons and flat irons fill the electrical plugs. Well, when my girlfriend and were blow drying our hair in the bedroom and one other in the bathroom we blew the circuit... oops we were in the dark at least the bedroom and the bathroom! Ha so we called room service and they were quick about coming to fix the problem. Since the music was blaring my girlfriends had not heard that the maintenance guy was there put it this way we're all girls we all have the same parts so there isn't need to cover and yea. He got his tip w\/ an eyeful of my gf bent over in her undies and to left inside the bathroom w\/ the door open my gf adjusting her towel. Fun times!

When we're recovering from previous night activities we hang out in the living room with the pull out stretched out and we lounge watching the lcd tv. The beds are super comfortable w\/ soft sheets. I really prefer this place than places like the Venetian it's nicer without the pain in the ass maze of a place and tacky decorations sometimes ha. There is no casino here which is a major plus no smoke smell!! And if you're in a non-smoking room (as we all are) you get fined if they find cigarette buds in the patio. 

The pool area is roof top. It's small but still real nice!! There's an big pool outside and like a ""U"" shaped pool that went from outiside to an indoor area I guess that's how I would explain it. And there is jacuzzis of course. They play music in the afternoon and have a bartender that makes yummy cocktails. 

They have specials sometimes as low as $120 a night which I think is a great deal especially you can load up the room without being cramped but I wouldn't tell them though lol. They have AAA discounts which I usually take advantage of also. 

I've read some reviews saying that a big con is it's off the strip well being a girl it may not be the same for everyone but unless you're staying at a hotel like Wynn you're not walking to the club. So if you're saving money staying at this hotel quit bitching and take a cab like you would normally do cause you're staying at Excalibur.

upfWmP1ivpdaOI95-4lOdg,_CDP0zqXE3iqMYGitD_NjA,Gd3kalpiBR-3WbvtgDiOnQ,2016-06-08,"The pedicures my bestie and I just got here today were most definitely a treat!  That's exactly why we wanted to try this spot too.  To be able to sit for an entire hour to have someone soak my feet, file them (with some fantastic callous remover), massage house-made lotion slowly into my legs and feet...was phenomenal to say the least!  It wasn't wam-bam-thank-you-ma'am style at all.  The lounge style is very posh and relaxing.  I was afraid the couches you sit on would hurt my back after awhile, but I was quite comfortable the entire time.  

We are used to mostly going to the $15 pedicure spots down the street because its simple and cheap.  But that's the problem...the actual pedicure is cheap as can be.  They get you in that chair and kick you out as fast as they can.

I had found Pedicure Lounge next door to my favorite Cajun restaurant one day and then looked it up on Yelp to find pretty great ratings.  It's by appointment only and they book up weeks in advance because of their regulars.  They say walk-ins are available if possible...but it is highly unlikely, unless you can come in during the week in the mornings before people are off work.

Our appointments were at 9am, when they first opened.  When we first came in, the two ladies who had opened the place didn't greet us and let us know they would be with us shortly...so we were slightly put off (hence the 4-stars).  But waiting in the really nice cushy lounge chairs and looking through their high-end colors kept us busy.  We were the only two there the entire time, which was actually quite the treat since we are used to the ""super crowded with no AC cheap spots"".  By the time we did sit down and get started we were very happy with both of our techs.

They had everything laid out complete with two large steins of real beer for our feet to soak in, lots of towels, house-made products, like their soap and scrub, and sterile items (including some interesting looking unknown feet pads).  This is one of their specialties and while strange, it was fantastic on our feet in addition to their house-made apple soak they poured in.  With the beer, this turned it into a very lovely smelling treat for our feet (our techs said it was to mimic Redd's Apple Ale).  Mmmmmmmm.  I was just about to take a picture of all the things laid out when my tech reached over and poured my beer out into the foot sink.  Dang it!

I loved that they did one foot at a time instead of whipping my feet out back and forth and yanking on me.  The unknown foot pads were actually for the callouses.  They left these on for quite a long time and then used very gentle foot files.  We were sadly amazed at how easily they were able to file our feet without using harsh looking files (that we are used to).  

The foot and leg massages were absolutely amazeballs because they took their time, used perfect pressure, and really really focused on our feet too.  The amount of time and care they took with putting our polish on in two very thick and full coats along with the perfect amount of top coat was quite nice.  

We loved the place and want to come back for sure.  It will be interesting to see how long the polish lasts in comparison to our cheapy places.  I can't wait to come back.  During the weekdays, you can call a few days ahead of time to make an appointment.  FYI:  If you are a first time customer, you have to put a $30 deposit down in case you don't show up for the appointment.  They apply it towards your service.  

The service is fantastic and I felt like they really want to give that nice experience.  Other than the initial no greeting or acknowledging us when we were there waiting...I am totally happy with Pedicure Lounge!  It sounds like no one set up their stations for them the day before, so they had to try to get it all ready while we were waiting, which is understandable...just with they would keep in mind they could tell us that and we wouldn't have a problem waiting.  

I'll be back in a few weeks or so Pedicure Lounge!  Thank you for the relaxing experience!",Beauty
vYktZQ_sYyT5xTBknuJuzQ,BDiRv7qcWhb5hs8DVczzlA,kZSTj7hAAW1eLkaKb-qMvQ,2012-08-12,"I'll start from the beginning.
I was in no frame of mind to deal with what was about to happen.  I was on my way to return the 6th phone in 18 months that had been covered under a Best Buy service plan.  I had picked up my ""new"" refurbished phone the day before, and the ""new"" phone had a damaged speaker. When my Mom tried to call me, I couldn't understand anything she was saying through the metallic static.  I've stayed calm and collected every trip into Best Buy, knowing that it's not the sales associate fault that they replace one faulty phone with another.
I walked in, I'm sure they could tell I was upset.  A sales associate recognized me from the previous phone issue and asked what was up.  I told him, I just received my replacement phone, the 6th one, and asked if there was anything more that could be done.  He said that there wasn't.  He stated that it could go into service an unlimited amount of times and nothing would be done.  When he said that, I did say, ""so they are going to replace one sh**y phone with another sh**y phone?""  In which he replied yes.
I just looked down in disbelief and said, ""Well, send it out; again, I can't be without a phone.""  The Mobile manager started helping, got the process started but then walked away, leaving me sitting there with no clue what was going on.  Finally, another associate came over and asked where he went, he didn't even know.  He sat down and stared at the computer, confused on what was going on and why I was left there.  I'm getting more upset, it's clear they aren't there to help me by then.
He had no clue what to do, calls over another employee, who calls over another.  By the time they start the process back up; there will be 5 employees  gathered around the screen in front of me.
This is where I started a spiral into my depression.
They started making jokes and comments about seeing my social security number, something that gives me high amounts of anxiety.  They continue looking and making jokes back in forth between each other until one person decides they can't figure out how to do a task that is done multiple times everyday. So, they call over another employee.  I'm panicked. Are they really able to see all my information?  
They finally figure it out, I have no clue how long it took, but it was a very long time.  They grab my loaner phone and instantly begin cracking jokes about it.  Telling me that I should be embarrassed to be seen with it, and telling me to hide it so no one can see.  Clearly seeing that I was upset, head down, on the verge of breaking down, I felt like I couldn't take anymore.
He tries to activate the loaner phone, and it won't activate, he tries over and over again, it's just not happening.  He finally calls someone and gets codes to turn it on, after a very long time.  I just keep thinking to myself, it's almost done, I'll be okay.
Just then the Mobile manager comes back, and the attention is taken back away from my issue. Instead, they would rather discuss the schedule in front of me.  I try hard to smile and hang in there through the entire process so far.
They activate the loaner phone and I thought, ""hooray, I made it"".  
Then the Mobile manager states ""Maybe the 8th times a charm"", and they both start laughing.  Seeing how upset I was, I feel that was incredibly inappropriate thing to say.  
This is the VERY IMPORTANT part, to me.
Without me knowing, without my consent, the worker takes a picture of me, as I was looking down with tears in my eyes, and places it as the background of my loaner phone.  He laughs and hands it to me.  As I looked at the screen, I could feel myself sinking into depression, quick.
He says we are done, so I gather up my things and leave the building fighting off tears.
I get home, try to text someone, and there are no contacts.  It was my understanding that you are supposed to get a loaner phone, equivalent to the one you turned in.  (ex. Android for an Android)  
I'm so depressed that my wife calls the store and speaks with the store manager, tells her the story, and my wife is told that there is nothing that can be done about the situation.
The Store Manager calls back some time later and the people who created the issue wanted to apologize to me.  I said, ""Why would I want to talk to them ever again, they crushed me, I want the District Managers number.""  She gave it to me.
I call the District Manager, who informs me that the store manager had already called him, and told him that the person claimed to be my friend.  I told him that I knew his first name and that was all.  He then started talking about how much he appreciated my business, he knew about how I use to work for the company, and thanked me.  Telling me everything I wanted to hear to calm me down as much as possible before he went into a sales pitch.  Telling me, they would look at when the phone contract expired, saying he would find out how much money I would get back for trading my phone back because I participated in the Bu",Shopping
TJnqvhtDsMB81w3eo0My-w,u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g,2015-05-15,"Even before you set foot into the restaurant, you may be welcomed with a long waiting line. If you do, keep calm and line up, as the line moves faster than you think. I'm not sure if you are able to make reservations beforehand, but ask the hostess if it's possible. The restaurant sadly doesn't take reservations online.

The menu is very simple, it's all on one page with 5-10 selections for each category. A more visible quality of the menu can be found here. We did our research about BurGR before coming, so we ordered two burgers (The Hell's Kitchen Burger and Farm Burger), truffle parmesan fries, and two shakes for dessert (Shake #4 and #5). We also ordered a beer from the drinks list which was available by iPad when you asked your server.

The restaurant was very lively with no empty tables. We were very excited to try our gourmet burgers because it was voted as the 'Best Tourist Food that's ""Actually Good""' by Vegas Seven in 2013. I was too excited about their curry ketchup, truffle aioli, burgers of course, and their ultimate shakes that everyone kept raving about. The atmosphere was quite cozy because of the large fireplace at BurGR, but the busy restaurant came hard upon the servers and so the service we received wasn't anything great.

Not so long after, our meals started to arrive. Starting with the fries, they were very crispy, none of them soggy from too much oil, and had truffle salt and truffle parmesan on top. You could really smell the real truffle from the fries which I was very surprised about. Normally, and when I had tried truffle fries before at other burger joints, I was never able to smell or taste the truffle in the fries; however, along with the truffle aioli, these fries were serious about their truffle! Hubby and I were very, very happy people...now we can't have truffle fries anywhere else.

We asked for a side of curry ketchup with our truffle fries because many recommended we do so. The curry ketchup is available when you order their ""Just fries"". I don't think it cost us extra for the side, but even if there was a surcharge, we would've gotten it anyway. After trying my french fries with curry ketchup, I realized I want lots of it at home. I wish it was available for purchase everywhere and anywhere. The combination of ketchup and curry was perfect.

I chose to have the Farm Burger which had duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. I mostly ordered it because of the duck meat because I've never had duck breast bacon before, and also never had it in my burger as a topping. After trying the burger, I found the bacon actually a little too salty so a little overpowering for my taste. It was great at first, but as I slowly finished my burger, I realized it was getting saltier and saltier, and there were not enough toppings inside the burger to offset the saltiness. Yes, the fried egg was a good touch, and it wasn't overcooked, but it wasn't enough to balance the saltiness. Now that I think about it, the Farm burger sounds like a good thing to eat for brunch...I mean, it has bacon, cheese, and egg inside your burger! Overall, the burger was great, but compared to the Hell's Kitchen Burger, it ranked second in our books.

The Hell's Kitchen burger is probably the best burger we had ever tried so far in our lives. Complete with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes, you know it's a good burger at first bite. There wasn't really anything that we didn't like about the burger, other than the fact that I didn't order it! The rich, savoury flavours were balanced out by the avocado, and instead of your standard ketchup, the real roasted tomatoes were great. Next time we're in Vegas, I know for sure that we are going back to BurGR and ordering this again! This burger is a must try when you're at BurGR!

Of the two shakes that we tried, this oreo shake was my favourite, while hubby preferred the coffee shake. Shake #4 is an oreo shake with creme brûlée pudding on top as well as an oreo cookie. I needed to order this and try it because the oreo cookie is my favourite snack. I couldn't really imagine how oreo and creme brûlée would taste together, but whatever happened in BurGR's kitchen, the combination was SO GOOD. The rich sweetness can probably be overpowering for some (ie. my hubby), but if you have a sweet tooth, you'd probably thank me for introducing this shake to you. Shake #5 is probably a better choice if you want to try something less sweeter, although it's still quite sweet. I know the amount of calories in these shakes are probably heart attack worthy, but I'd rather run for 10 miles after my meal instead of not trying it!

Overall, I believe this is how a burger joint should be done. In my opinion, it is better than Shake Shack, Umami burger, In-n-out Burger, and all other independent burger chains out there. If you're a burger lover, this place must be on your to-do list! To me, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is a must try!",Restaurant
tcLY_0JaQCDRx7ozRFUw9w,scmy9XdxbK6oO2YSMwvdYA,uYRoRMStydO1CgfsMZ2lsA,2016-09-07,"Our appointment was July 13, 2016. I will spare the girl that helped us the public humiliation of posting her name. (Although part of me would like to.) I have debated posting this review because I do not like leaving bad reviews & never do. I am in the hospitality industry & know how difficult it can be to deal with the public. In order for me to go to this length, you have to really upset me. It started when we walked in. I quickly greeted the shop assistant and (when she told us her name) I told her that she was the person I spoke to on the phone & thanked her for being so helpful. To this she responded with a weird look in my direction and said, ""Oh, really? Well, I don't remember that at all. Probably wasn't me."" I was a little thrown off by this because it immediately made the group, and myself, uncomfortable. 

After that, our experience only became worse. She seemed annoyed by our presence (even though we had had the appointment for almost a month), she was obviously irritated by my bridesmaids questions (these are very kind women, I promise you!), and, at one point, my sister-in-law asked a question and she remained silent until I finally stepped in and answered it the best I could. I had to basically take over with what little knowledge I had on the dresses and she disappeared to sit in their office. 

I really tried to remain positive and didn't let any of my girls see how disappointed I was. This is my first engagement & I had been looking forward to this day with my favorite 6 women for a very long and We had just had a lovely brunch & some of my bridesmaids took the day off of work specifically for this. Plus, all of us had driven across town for this appointment. (About 30-45 mins!) Maybe that was part of the problem though. Maybe our zip codes did not meet her obviously high standards. 

The icing on the cake was when another group of ladies entered the shop. Her attitude changed immediately! They announced that they were a HALF HOUR early their scheduled appointment & were willing to wait until ours was over. Instead of asking if I minded or offering them a beverage while they waited, the newly revived shop assistant urged them to begin shopping and trying on dresses without so much as looking my way. One of the girls in the new group quickly reached over me & plucked a dress from my hands that my sister was trying to color swatch. To say I wasn't pleased is an understatement. 

We headed to the back to meet the rest of my ladies who were waiting patiently by the office with a few more questions before purchasing. The shop attendant was too busy with the new group and enthusiastically helping them with dresses in a way we did not receive. Although frustrated, I made one last attempt to make the best of it. 

I politely asked her if she would come over and answer a few last questions to which she begrudgingly responded, ""I'll be there in a minute,"" and continued helping her new group--a group that was very early to their appointment! 

That's when I snapped. I asked which girls planned on buying their dress that day and ALL of them said they wanted to. I apologized to them fiercely & asked that they wrote the information for their dresses in their phones. I could not support a business that was comfortable treating their customers in this manner. We quickly gathered our things and began to exit the shop. 

Just as we were about to leave the shop assistant half-heartedly asked, ""Did you have some questions before you go?"" I almost laughed out loud but was too angry to let it escape. Instead, I simply responded, ""I believe we got all of the answers we need,"" and left. 

In the beginning, I tried to justify her behavior to just having a ""bad"" day--we all have them. But, after seeing how quickly she changed her tune when the super tan, fresh blowouts, & luxury tote clad group of girls came in, I was infuriated. I would hate to think that the fact that my bridal party is half Latina women & that we are all from the West Valley of Phoenix would have anything to do with it but, unfortunately, that is all I  am left with to assume. 

We may not be from Scottsdale, but we are a group of good-hearted, hardworking, educated, & patient women who deserved to enjoy that day. Sadly, this will go down as one of the worst shopping experiences I have ever had. To top it off, she missed out on the sale of six dresses! But I  am sure they didn't need ""our"" money. My only hope is that this review makes them think twice the next time they want to judge a book by its cover... Or it's zip code!",Shopping
OewJY79qGDifUGMAc-hgKg,K4p0zpBKqPI7xBf6_RamYQ,mbLguBsFuy34zKlor2xcIg,2017-03-30,"I stayed here on a recent trip to Vegas. I'm a Hilton Honors Member. Typically the Hilton in Vegas would not be my first choice of accommodations, but because I earn membership points while staying at this resort, I figured it worked out well. And because the price is comparable to other similar resorts on the strip, it didn't seem like a bad idea to stay here.

This hotel is located on the very edge of the strip. Although you are technically ""walking distance"" from all major attractions along the Boulevard, it's still quite a jaunt to get from the front doors of this hotel to any sight-seeing things like the Bellagio Fountains or Venetian shopping center. A cab ride across the strip will run you between $12 and $16. An Uber ride across the strip is around $9. We stayed when the weather was very comfortable and our walk from this hotel all the way to the opposite side of the strip at Mandalay Bay took us about an hour and a half- walking at a normal (not rushed or slow) pace. 

Aside from the distant location there are a few other key things to mention. This hotel is -just- a hotel. It is not a casino. There is no gambling within the hotel and overall it lacks a lot of extra options. There is a ""restaurant"" at the pool. I use the term 'restaurant' loosely though, because it only has about 12 total menu options. There is also a bar, but it closes around 1:00 AM. They advertise that they serve Starbucks coffee- which I assumed meant they had a Starbucks. They do not. They do sell Starbucks brand coffee in a little café downstairs. It's not mixed coffee- just plain black coffee that you serve yourself. And the Café itself is an utter rip off. All of the items lack price tags and you get a bit of sticker shock when you go to the register; as it's terribly expensive. One late night my fiancé and I purchased sushi, trail mix, a granola bar, and two small coffees for $25. The sushi was some of the worst I'd ever had- which didn't help the fact that I felt I'd been overcharged. 

The bar is as equally overpriced as the 'Café'. Two domestic beers ran us around $20 one evening. They weren't served on tap, either; they were from the bottle. One was a cider. The bartender was extremely slow to serve us and very unprofessional. He told me that he could not make a pina colada because he did not have a blender. He had all of the ingredients directly behind him to make a non-blended colada, but chose not to. He also told another patron that he didn't serve coffee late at night. After the patron politely pleaded for just one cup- he agreed, went over the a coffee machine, and made a cup. It wasn't that hard; he easily could have done it without needing a plea. 

Those are my complaints. But, there are a few positives to this hotel. Because it does not have a casino and is off of the strip a bit it's very quiet. You'll easily get a good night's rest here- and most of the visitors seem to be in Vegas for business or are a bit older. The hotel is very quiet. It's also very well-maintained, clean, and has modern décor. The pool is large with two pools and three hot tubs. Even during spring break, in the middle of the afternoon, we could easily find a seat around the pool. There weren't too many children and there was plenty of space to swim without bumping into other people (like some Vegas pools). 

I would recommend this hotel for people who want somewhere to relax and enjoy themselves. It'd be great for families as well because it isn't in the center of everything. It's also right next to Circus Circus (which is a great place for finding kid-friendly entertainment, affordable meals, and cheap tables). On the other hand, I do suggest avoiding the café and bar. Neither are worth the ridiculous prices. And keep in mind that it's a bit of a walk to get anywhere.",Beauty
tLgVAXKnkr724OSQb5tLlA,MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,2016-12-08,"This was the first time I walked into a sushi spot where we didn't get no ""irrashaimase"", sushi chefs all looking down, host's back facing us. When he did turn around it was to ask how many in our party. I normally don't prefer taking the whole crew out for an AYCE sushi, but on this night we did. It wasn't as busy when we entered in comparison to when we left. We were able to get seated pretty quick. The tables are more of picnic style seating where their tables are connected so be prepared to share another end with another couple\/family.

Since the whole crew was present, that meant a highchair was needed. I quickly made a mental note to never bring the babies with me when coming here because the highchair is seated at the end of the table where they have this button system...which of course any curious toddler\/baby turn into gumby just to press those buttons. Which....gets pretty annoying because the button isn't something you can move off. Therefore, you have to scootch the highchair more towards the corner of the table giving your kid an awkward seating and the potential to slam his\/her face on that corner because he\/she is throwing a fit over not being able to reach the button. Sigh.

Anyway, they have quite a selection for their AYCE. I found Umiya to be pretty good. I loved how their rolls\/nigiris weren't rice\/sauce overloaded. No fishy flavors which is a great thing! I personally ordered\/tried their garlic tuna nigiri, crispy rice with spicy tuna, salmon lovers roll, vegetable tempura (a brocolli, zucchini, carrot), spicy garlic edamame (which wasn't spicy at all), spicy tuna toll, and their ribeye steak (which is like 4slices of steak served alone). The only thing I didn't really care for was their garlic edamame. I love edamame, didn't love it here. 

The husband had uni, ebi, fried shrimp heads, salmon belly, yuzu yellowtail, unagi, tuna, salmon, and aji. Don't even get me started on the quantities. Lol. He thought they were all pretty good. Typical.

Anyway, they clearly have a system. Water was quickly refilled, plates were quickly cleaned off, service wasn't neglectful at all...out of all the sushi spots we have ever been to...I swear it felt like 5mins after we ordered...we were getting our orders. I connected my eyebrows a few times upon getting our orders because the turn around was ridiculously quick! At this point...it was busy so getting our orders quick and it being busy...that was quite impressive. I looked back at the chefs a couple times convinced there was an octopus working. 

Even though we didn't get the greeting upon entering, my husband never getting his masago and me having to remind the waitress of an order and reminding one of the wait helps of the fork he was supposed to bring...we gave it a 4 because despite it all...thought our experience was pretty deserving of a 4. 

We'd come here again but I don't think this place is as kid-friendly especially if you have one needing to be in a high chair and that damn button system thing. Okay, so the button is to call your waiter over, red button is for your check, and I completely forgot what the other colored button was for but I believe it's for drinks. 

Definitely worth a try if you are looking to try a new spot. I'd say slip bringing the kids in so you can thoroughly bask in the ambiance and enjoy. But if you do bring the kids...highchairs have working buckles! For AYCE...kids ages 3-7 are 12.95 (half-off). Children 8 and up are full price. For desserts...their ice cream are unlimited except for the mochi. 1 each per person.

Enjoy!",Restaurant

We've been here so many times only because of convenience, and the variety they offer on their menu, not because it's great, delicious, can't wait to have more, etc.. nothing like that. Solely for convenience purposes. ""Wazuzu at Encore offers Pan-Asian flavors inspired by Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Singaporean and Thai cuisine."" Especially convenient when one is craving say.. Chinese, and the other Thai or even Japanese.

Each time the food has been very consistent over the years, even down to plating and garnishing.

I couldn't say the same about the service. It always seemed barely there.. as though non of the servers really want to be there. It takes a while for them to drop off and top off the water, a while longer to take your order, and once the food is delivered, don't bother for any service, if you care for some, be prepared to wave someone down. They are quickest when it comes time for you to pay, each and every single time. That's suddenly when they appear, fake smile, and actually give you more water! (We normally just order a large bottle of Figi or Pellegrino along with our drinks so if and when we need water we just pour it ourselves.)

What we've ordered here: (most roughly a dozen times...we normally order the same stuff, and tack on something new to try each time)

W_f8jhsQr_fAiitjf3Zm5w,tX4d5ktzse4TPxNOds4VCw,msJmDVMEd2fOnO5GEuWsoA,2012-07-05,"The most important thing to note before going to Magic Oven at Queen and Parliament is that they don't seem to have A\/C.  A group of my friends and myself got together in the recent ""feels like"" 43 degree Toronto heat and sweltered throughout our meal.  The ice in our water melted in minutes.  Consider this your warning.  If you can get over that, this is a great place to meet, hangout, and eat some great food.

As a group we've been encouraging each other to be healthier.  This meant that our weekly pub grub meet-ups fell by the wayside as we all worked on watching our waistlines.  Not wanting to give up being social all together, we searched for an option that would make everyone happy.  Lucky for us Magic Oven has organic ingredients and healthy options (in addition to an entire bar of delicious sounding adult beverages) which seemed to appease everyone in our group.

We went on a Wednesday night without even realizing that Wednesday is their unlimited pizza and salad night.  For about $15 you can order any of their pizzas (minus the seafood and their signature pizza) and get a side salad (Caesar or green).  You can then keep on ordering as many as you can eat until 9:00.  Not a bad deal, considering most of their pizzas start at $12-$14.  Plus, they let you take home the leftovers, which is more than I can say about some other all-you-can-eat places.

I got their version of a Hawaiian pizza, which came topped with bacon, prosciutto, coconut (!), and pineapple.  I opted for a gluten-free crust ($2 extra) and dairy-free Daiya cheese (included in the price).  I didn't opt for the special, because I knew I wouldn't be eating more than one pizza.  Plus, my boyfriend doesn't touch anything of the leafy green variety, so I nibbled at some of his Caesar salad.

The salad was a disappointment.  The one listed as an entree on the menu comes with croutons and bacon bits, and is served with kale.  This one is just dressing smothered romaine.  Plus, the heat had made the leaves a bit wilty, so it was unappetizing.  Thankfully, the pizza was delicious.  The gluten-free crust tasted delicious and had a nice crunch to it.  The toppings worked well together, and I barely ate half the pizza before I was too full to continue.

Our waitress was efficient - almost too efficient.  She memorized all of our orders (including all our specific requests) without writing anything down, and would refill drinks and other requests really quickly.  However, there were a couple times where we would request something and she'd be off getting that item\/drink before anyone else could even open their mouth.  In the end, everyone got everything they wanted, it just cost her a few extra trips back and forth.

The food quality is very high, but great quality comes at a cost.  Since I didn't get the special and added the gluten-free crust, my pizza came to $18.  After tax and tip, it was almost $25 for a 10"" pizza and a glass of water.  Kind of pricey, and definitely not an everyday sort of thing.

However, given the wide variety of items and their allergy-inclusive menu items, I have no doubt that we will make Magic Oven a regular stop.",Restaurant

But because there's a bunch of people that pissed me off. If they have rules, there's always a better way to explain it to guests without offending them. 
At check in, we were greeted with a set of rules, about the mini bar. The fridge was filled with items for sale, if you touch anything you have 45 seconds to put it back otherwise you'll get charged for it. And since i have little kids. I decided to just have it locked. I asked if they can put a fridge there for our use, they said they can, but its like $16 per night. Great! And then there's the minibar, i asked if they can just take it out. They said they can but again, for a fee. But they said they're going to make an inventory at check out so as long as the items aren't consumed then they're going to waive it. Whoever invented this, should be hung! 

There's no microwave, no coffee maker. If you needed coffee after midnight. You're in luck! Cuz starbucks is only open till midnight. So you might have to buy coffee from them and its a whopping $14. 

One of the spa staff didnt wanna have anything to do with you..i have to note though that one of them was nice. (I think she's hispanic)  But she was assisting another customer at the time i had a question so i had no choice but to ask the other girl. I decided to have my pedicure done at the salon cuz they made me feel more welcome. 

At the feast buffet, we we're trying to enjoy our last dinner at the hotel, the food selection was better than during lunch time. I was happy about that. But the guy who was serving ice cream was so rude, thanks for giving my day a bad conclusion! His name was TONY! He called me out for taking pictures of the ice cream. He said he didnt want people taking pics of it. So i was like. Oh yeah? Howcome there's a lot of this online? He replied, "" well they dont really say anything, but if im here, then i dont want people taking pics. And he did the same to my husband, he acted like he's talking to his coworker "" he goes.. man! Howcome these people dont listen? Why do they keep taking pictures? My husband was like. "" why? Is it illegal? "" and then he tamed all of a sudden. 

We decided to complain to the supervisor who btw apologized but wasnt really apologetic. I guess she needed to be somewhere. Cuz she looked like she was in a hurry. The lady that served us was very nice though. 

And finally when we were about to leave my husband and i decided we wanna try our luck, so we wanna gamble a little before we leave, he said he's going to put all our stuff in the car and that we wait around the area for him to come back, and since i had no idea about gambling and the law that surrounds it. I was like 2 feet away from the casino itself, i decided to ask the guy there how the thing works. And he just looked at me, then there came an old guy who has an accent who said, i cant be in that area with a minor, im like im not going to gamble, i just had a question. He goes, what is it? I just wanted to know how the thing works, so when my husband comes back i can have him watch the kids. And i can do it myself. He goes, you can ask when the kids not around. Jeez! I was probably wrong, but there's always a better way to tell people without offending them. So i decided to move like maybe 10 ft away, i thought i was fine. But apparently no, cuz he called me out again. And gave me a lecture about the law and that they could get fired if they dont implement it. Jeez! Again there's always a better way to explain to guests without offending them. Cuz we came across another guy who works there and he was friendly enough to tell us, that there's a place where we could leave the kids so that we can play, and he explained that you just have to insert money and that's it. 

So all in all. The hotel was nice, bathroom, bed, tv. Very modern. Fitness center was nice, very clean and like new equipment. Spa is gorgeous, pool is really nice and maintained. Although one of the pools were filthy, but there was a bunch of pools so we just went past that. The bad review was because of the customer service. I have to say that we have come across some friendly people. But most of them we're cold and rude even! They should really make an effort to give good customer service, as it is what will make people keep coming back. And some of these guests, like us had to drive 14 long hours just to have a good vacation and trying to have a good experience, so it's easier to get disappointed. Because it was an effort to get there. We expect the same effort from their end!",Beauty
93I6JHKqWySyl72SozWYWA,oaaEXgQ3x51cXE3GTXrT1Q,xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw,2008-03-15,"I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to ""Mongolian BBQ"" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two. 

I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it. 

I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.

And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences. 

The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a ""no frills"" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.

Service was attentive, but odd since this is a ""get your own food"" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.

I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl. 

So I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC's... Impressive.",Restaurant

We ordered a sofa on line for delivery. The Living Places web site said clearly (and still does today) ""Available for next day delivery or next day pickup"". We received a call the night prior to the delivery date confirming delivery albeit not at the time requested. No big deal just a change of time we could deal with. The next morning I got a call saying that the sofa was still in California and wouldn't be here for 7-10 days. I asked how that could be since I had received a delivery confirmation just the night before. The woman on the phone said something to the effect that that is an automated system that doesn't know what is really going on. Why they would use a defective confirmation system that called people with incorrect information was beyond my comprehension until, as it turns out, that the woman on the phone was lying, read on:

We went to the Scottsdale store and first talked to the ""manager"" Chase. He seemed nice enough and then he took us to another ""manager"" Tim. Tim talked to someone and from the gist of their conversation it seems that some warehouse manager somewhere had decided to ""override"" our order and sell the sofa to someone else which left us SOL, then he lied to me saying they had ""issues"" with their inventory system or maybe there was a quality issue with the sofa. Evidently he thought I was either deaf or stupid since this was after I heard him say to someone that ""I guess she overrode this order"". We told him that we had divested of our old sofa and we needed another due to an event we were hosting the next day. He said maybe we could find something else that we liked and offered us a $50 Gift card for our trouble. I asked about having the floor model delivered and they said it would take 2 days because they have to get it off the floor and then send it to the warehouse so they could ship it to us. I told Chase that we live literally 2 miles from there. Why do you have to ship it all over the city to get it 2 miles. His answer was something to the effect ""that's the way we have to do it, everything has to be delivered from the warehouse"". I asked, ""no exceptions? "" He said ""no exceptions"" My answer was ""the customer is always wrong!"". So we canceled the order and left. Two hours later we found a sofa of much better quality at Lazy Boy right around the corner for about $200 more. 

The bottom line is that the Living Spaces employees are so indoctrinated in some sick corporate culture that they may as well be droids. There is zero empowerment to take charge of a really poor customer experience and at least minimize it. If you have a bad experience and the people you deal with don't seem to give a damn about it you will never return to the business. I am not an expert in customer service but I'm also not a novice. I do know that an organization that will not empower employees to serve customers is a business that is destined to fail.

The Living Places culture is ""we don't care about you because we haven't been programmed to care about you. You don't matter. We have a job until the next droid takes our place"". You just have to look at their responses to critical Yelps to see what I mean. It is always :  ""We are so sorry to hear of this unpleasant experience and would like to look into this further, please email your sales order number and preferred contact information to socialmedia@livingspaces....

I won't try to count how many times this answer has appeared. If I had to guess there's a bot on the other end. If not, it is just another non thinking programmed Living Spaces cyborg dutifully sending an email that they know they won't ever have to do anything about. 

In any event everything seemed to work out to our favor. Apparently Living Spaces has a lack of quality so we won't have to deal with that and that's a good thing.

If I may paraphrase Ben Franklin ""The bitterness of poor service remains long after the sweetness of poor quality and low price is forgotten.""

wTnBAm_z5QqBD6B9-NAkkw,5RPhQ5OyMZmZAe8q-GS0xg,6kkxRV8H9SQLybj0xnEbMw,2013-07-03,"I have stayed here twice now. My daughter does competitive dance and we are forced to stay here when she has her National Competition. Both visits have been horrendous. The first stay started with us arriving with two children at 11:00 PM after driving 5 hours to get there. It took over an hour to get help at the front desk. It turns out, the front desk Rep decided it was time for their break and just left without telling any customers in the long line. Once we got checked in, I went down to get our luggage to return to our room. This was after I carried both children, half asleep, to the other end of the hotel. When I walked back to request my luggage and a bellman, they told me no. I had to go back and call. I explained both my kids were asleep and that wouldn't work. I also explained I was suffering from a debilitating hernia that I was scheduled to have operated on the day I got back. They still didn't care and were really condescending. I told them fine and I would take it. I was not allowed to use their cart. I ended up carrying the luggage all the way across the hotel myself in severe pain. They laughed. The same service continued. My pain did not get better thge whole week.

I just went again for our competition. I went to check in, after waiting in a line for near an hour, and was told I could not. My wife booked the trip so I could not check in. My wife was backstage getting my girls ready to dance so she couldn't come. The front desk lady informed me very rudely "" well, maybe your wife should have thought about this ahead of time...very sarcastically"". My card was the one on the file. I asked her to call her cell, which she did. When she got off she looked at me and said, ""I don't like the way your wife talked to me. She should learn how to speak to people:. She then looked at me with a smile and said, ""You can check in after 5:00"". and laughed. I told her not to abuse her situation because she didn't like the way my wife spoke to her. I asked when we could actually check in and she told me to read the webpage. OK! I asked for a manager and after about ten minutes of them speaking out of my vision, the manager came out, chest puffed up, and glaring at me, ready to have a fight. She also told me to read the webpage. We finally got a call that our room was ready at 5:00...shocker! I called twice before arriving to confirm we would have 2 beds, due to health needs of my youngest. We got to our room and it was just a king. We called and asked to be moved and were told too bad, that is all they had. My wife then went to the front desk crying and asked for help and was rudely turned away. She had one agent tell her she should just go buy a bed at REI around the corner. 

Clearly, this was their way to get back at my wife for apparently not knowing how to speak to people, which by the way, she is non-confrontational and I heard the conversation, which was not bad. 

I heard multiple stories of this kind the whole week. It is clear that the organization stays understaffed to cut cost and therefore lacks proper personnel and competent staff. 

There are too many other options in Las Vegas and surrounding areas for you to risk staying here. Find another option. We will be staying elsewhere, as will many others we spoke to, next year. It is not worth it. The Casino is weak and as I read on other posts, the slots are terribly tight. I agree. 

On a bright note, if you can put up with incompetence and terrible service, the pool is great. You will not have very good service, but it is a lot of fun for adults and children. It is a shame that this place is such a mess. I chalked it up to an isolated incident last year, but it is clearly a trend. The employees are all miserable, except for the cleaning crew, who were the only employees to be helpful, smile, and engage. Maybe they should be promoted to more customer facing positions.

This place ruined two days of my hard earned vacation and I will not let it happen again. I encourage you to look elsewhere. My experience was echoed throughout the entire week. My intention is not to hurt GVR, but rather save any other families a big headache. Good luck.",Beauty

Let's back up and start at the beginning.
From the time you enter Echo & Rig, you know you are in for a unique experience.  There's the cute little bar tucked off to the left.  The white staircase which must have heaven at the top.  The cute group of hostesses in their all black attire.  And then there's the meat.  That's right.  A full butcher shop with big, beautiful hunks of meat pornographically on display.  Meat-centric heaven. 

We went with friends on a Saturday night at 7 and arrived a little early, expecting a wait.  No need, a table was ready for us and when our friends arrived, we were quickly taken to the upper echelon where the real deal happens.  The overall vibe of the restaurant's upstairs is that of a very inviting, rich person's dining room (No travertine decking out my house!).  The lighting is low and warm, but not so low that you need a flashlight to read the menu.  I am also a fan of open kitchens and really like how it is set back enough that the noise from the kitchen doesn't take over the dining room.  

Now for the stars of the evening.  We took the advice of Yelpers and ordered the Portobello fries although I was a little unsure.  Don't question it.  That crispy, fried goodness is delicious and unlike anything I've ever had.  We also started with:

Fried Spinach Salad - One of my favorites.  Just the right amount of oil and the crunch of the cauliflower is bomb
Kale Salad
Caesar Salad
Fried Oyster Sliders (2 orders) (Didn't try because fried oysters are not for me)
Small charcuterie plate - this was a last minute addition by my boyfriend who knows all too well that there's not really anything I like more than a beautiful plate of meat, cheese and accoutrements.  I have insanely high standards and Echo & Rig's plate exceeded them.  Fresh prosciutto and salami, two housemade pates, sour gherkins, whole grain mustard, some sliced turkey and toast points.  I literally had to force myself not to eat the whole thing, knowing a bomb diggity steak was in my future.   

My friend and I both had the Spencer Steak which was recommended by our server and our other halves both had the New York Strip.  I really liked my steak, but be aware that the char on the outside of the steak may require you go a little more raw than you normally would.  My medium rare was a little too done but now I know to order rare.  It was still an incredible cut of meat and I really enjoyed it.  You get a steak sauce of your choice and I went with the horseradish cream.  

As everyone has said, there's no corkage fee at Echo & Rig.  I hope they continue this practice, although I know it has to be difficult to make money doing so.  We brought a few bottles of wine for dinner and then ended the night with some espresso and coffees.  The manager visited our table and all around, the wait staff was just fantastic.  Finally, a dining denizen that I can love in the snooze fest that is Summerlin cuisine.  Echo & Rig, don't do me like Rosemary's.  Don't you ever go away.",Restaurant

For a corporate mega-market, it's pretty nice.  I like it better than the Von's stores in the area.  If you can visit on a weekday morning (avoid the frenzy), you'll likely have a pleasant experience. I'm a job seeker so I can always time my excursions to avoid Type A shoppers.

Something you'll notice right away: Deluxe shopping carts. So many stores have carts that are caked in grime. They're coated with sticky secretions and have wobbly wheels. I don't know if I just made a lucky grab, but my cart was like new. It glided smoothly over the linoleum floor. It handled like a sports car.

It's a clean store with spacious aisles of nicely displayed merchandise. There are aisles and aisles of merchandise. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for the arrangement of the merchandise, so I get plenty of exercise hiking from one end of the vast space to the other trying to track down a few items. It would be nice if they would print a map of the store. Do you think they would?  HELL no.

Several employees greeted me cheerfully and asked if I needed help finding something, which of course I did. What I need is a personal guide.

Right by the exit, they have a display of chips and dips. I'm not sure whether you're supposed to grab these on the way in or if they are thoughtfully placed there to satisfy a last-minute urge. What are you supposed to do?  Run back in after you just finished an exhausting shopping ordeal?  I guess some people do. What if you have an eating disorder and you scrupulously avoided the snack section?

In any case, they have your best interest at heart. They don't want you to get all they way home and slap yourself upside the head:  I FORGOT THE CHIPS!

For a grocery store, they have a decent beer selection.  They had Widmer on sale for $15 a short case down from $18.  $15 is still too high for Widmer even if it is one of the finest brews on the market. I picked up a 6-pack of Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA for $10. Fine beer! (Get it for $7 at Lee's Discount.)

To get their special deals, you have to produce the Albertsons club card they always swore they would never have. They won't remind you to use your card. It's up to you to remember. The cashiers already have enough on their mind passing items over the scanner,

Like any retailer, the store is too hot on a chilly morning. It's part of the retail strategy to make shopping as uncomfortable and stressful as possible. The shirtsleeved employees are cool whereas you're sweating in a jacket. They want you to be miserable so you'll splurge on sugar-saturated beverages and stress-relieving snacks.

This store has TV sets at the checkout lines. It's very considerate of Albertsons to provide stimulation while we kill time waiting for our groceries to be processed over the scanners. If you don't have any calls to make, no one to text, no funny videos on your iPhone, those TVs are a godsend. You can watch commercials. There is also a TV in the produce area in case you get bored contemplating Navel oranges.

They have self-check terminals. I never use them if I can avoid it because something usually goes wrong. You get error messages like PLEASE CALL FOR ASSISTANCE. There's no one to call. A plus for self-check: The machine does prompt you to scan your club card.

It's somewhat annoying that vendors are busy stocking shelves in the morning. They block the aisles and expect you to work around them. On this visit, the Coke dude was piling twelve packs onto a shelf.  He graciously stepped aside when I approached. We had a quick chat. He's new on the job and grateful to be employed. Give him time. He'll develop the same surly attitude as the others. They're not employees of the store, so they don't give a shit about shoppers.

When they bark out announcements over the PA system, they shout. It makes no sense.  That's why you have a microphone. You're alone with your thoughts in the Asian food section when suddenly they blast you with an ear-splitting announcement. They're going to give someone a heart attack.  

A manager explained to me that the stores are built without speakers in the back. They have to yell over the PA system so workers in the back will hear.  They save fifty bucks on construction costs but torture shoppers daily. At least they make sure no one falls asleep evaluating the tortilla selection.

Other retailers use bluetooth technology to yell at each other.  This concept is too modern for the hidebound grocery business.

Since grocery shopping is a necessary evil and a distasteful chore at best, and considering that Albertsons is generally a horrible place to shop, getting your groceries here isn't so bad.

Gas rewards:  If you spend $50 on groceries, you can save 5 cents a gallon on gas (up to 20 gallons) at Albertsons Express (4055 S Durango). A dolluh! Nothing to sneeze at, right?",Shopping
QufleOsnnhpKCWEnyWJ0Cg,uaC8Ku7fqwD4Gh6L1YabAg,VPS6qGuQsptLmHChOvA0_Q,2014-06-19,"Absolutely LOVE that I can wake up in the morning and be out-the-door beautiful in minutes, all thanks to Theresa!!! She is hands down the best permanent makeup artist in the Las Vegas valley and beyond. Believe me I know, as I researched for many hours and consulted with several other purported ""professionals"" before finally (thankfully) choosing Theresa Garcia. 

During my initial consultation appointment (which was free) Theresa spent nearly an hour explaining the permanent makeup process, her carefully crafted, precision method (which she has honed over many, many years), the Made in USA water-based inks she uses (as opposed to cheaper\/imported inks, which contain metals and can be damaging\/unsightly), her professional artist background, and how she utilizes color theory to match one's own, unique coloring with the proper pigments required in order to bring about the desired finished effect. 

Theresa explained how important it is to also take into account one's own skin coloring, that rose pigment on a light-skinned person will look completely different on a darker skinned person. Also ""warm"" complexions and ""cool"" complexions must be accounted for when mixing inks. (Theresa, by the way, is one of the few artists who mixes her own inks; most others use inks straight from the tube. A definite no-no she says.) 

Theresa is the original inventor of the ""3d eyebrow,"" which is the most natural-looking--NOT the hideous tattooed eyebrows of the past. Theresa's technique uses very soft, powder finish blending, with a few individual hair strokes for the most natural look--a look that only Theresa offers. 

My own brows are naturally full, so I was unsure whether I would benefit from enhancement. But after seeing Theresa's portfolio of work, I knew I was definitely ""in""!!  

Now that she has completed my brows, I don't know how I ever lived without them! It's true what they say, that your eyebrows frame your face, and even though I wasn't lacking hair volume, it was Theresa's expertly applied shaping and finishing that completed my amazing new look. All very natural, not harsh or overdone. But the difference is undeniable, very classy and polished (Thank You, Theresa!!).

Besides the amazing brow work, I had upper eyeliner and lower lash ""enhancement,"" which is a very thin ""smudging"" of color inside the lower lash line, so it doesn't look harsh or overdone. My lips, too, were perfectly enhanced, and Theresa spent a great deal of time perfecting the actual agreed-upon ""shape"" before beginning her work. (Theresa always draws on, or lets you draw on, and approve, any shape before actually beginning her work...this is after all your face, and she wants to be sure it's done right, exactly the way YOU want it.) Theresa does a ""natural-blended lip line,"" NOT yesterday's too-harsh line that you sometimes still see people wearing. She also offers a ""full, blended lip"" which means the color is carried over the full lip for a very natural finished look. (Great for women in their 50's--like me--who have lost some lip color and definition over the years.)

Theresa is well-known and highly regarded for the natural look she is famous for achieving. Theresa's clients are always beautifully enhanced, but NEVER garish, harsh, or crazy-looking.

Theresa uses only the highest, medical-grade numbing cream, and gives it plenty of time to work before ever touching your face. This eliminates nearly 100% of any pain one might associate with permanent makeup application--if you have your work done by Theresa. Should you find yourself in another permanent makeup artist's chair, beware!!! Many are not authorized to use this medical grade numbing cream, and indeed I have heard plenty of horror stories of other Vegas tattoo artists using little or no numbing cream at all!! This is unacceptable in this day and age, and I would think twice before choosing an artist without the qualifications or concern for your comfort.

Under Theresa's expert hand, your healing time is just 2-3 days, and there is never any scabbing or injury to your face. Theresa uses a fresh needle for each client and procedure, so there is ZERO worry of infection or contamination. Her prices are reasonable and her work is AWESOME!! (HELPFUL TIP: Ask about the 3 procedure discount--lips, eyes and brows all done at once--saves you a bundle!)",Beauty
DKanrBhHj6zKcgMWQKCMHA,AxYrBBCMJ1r6_Z7NF6uDng,p8svpT_viqoRpa74YukXFA,2015-05-07,"So it had been a few years since I had gotten my eyes looked at and I thought I should get a new pair of glasses. I called this store because it was the last place I had gone and I was satisfied with the service I received last time, and they took my insurance. (VSP...but I'm pretty sure everyone takes that.)

They moved to a new location down the street from their old one and the place is huge and nice and clean. The showroom is considerably larger than their previous location. My previous doctor didn't seem to be at this new location so I was assigned to a new (to me) doctor. She was great and very friendly and upbeat. I have no problems with the doctor. 

My issue is that I arrived 15 minutes early for my 9:30AM appointment (with only 2 other people in the waiting area) and I didn't get taken back to the exam room until 10AM. Did a few tests, then went to another exam room and the doctor came in and did her thing. Then I went to pick frames and lens options, and was charged about $340 after all my insurance allocations had been applied. I expected as much and since I was buying premium frames and coatings for the lenses, I was not surprised. They tell me it will be 7-10 days for them to come in.

So...in this modern world where I get handmade shoes from Korea delivered to my door within 6 days of my order, I order a set of glasses that might have to go across town to get made or even on the outside chance there are no lens fabrication facilities here in the Vegas valley, they might have to send it to Los Angeles. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE 10 DAYS!!!  (I know...I sound petty and stupid, but keep reading.)

So on the 10th day, since I haven't heard from them, I call Optic Gallery and after a brief delay, they tell me that the glasses have arrived and that I was on their list of people to call. To be fair, it was about 9:30AM and it is plausible that they were *just about* to call me. Anyway, I go to pick the glasses up and for some reason everything is fine except for the left lens. My eye refuses to focus through the left lens. At first, I thought maybe I had smudged the lens and that's why I couldn't see properly. The lady helping me graciously cleaned them off and I tried again. SAME PROBLEM.  She checks my prescription and then tests the lenses and she determines that the ""axis"" is off for the left lens. (Whatever that means.) 

So now she says you can wear it like that, or leave it here, but regardless, I'll place an order and have the lens re-made. She talks about overnight couriers how they will fix it asap.  I leave a bit irritated, but I keep telling myself that things happen and sometimes things go wrong and stop being a whiny little bitch about it. 

So that was Tuesday (5\/5\/2015) and I just called today because I hadn't heard anything. Again, after a delay, I am told that it might be tomorrow or next Monday when the new lens comes in and then they will cut it to fit my frames for me while I wait. 

To recap in case you nodded off during my semi-rant, I have paid this company over $600 (between exams, eye tests, and lenses and frames) waited 12 days, have to make yet another visit to pick up the new lens (assuming it is correctly made this time) and I STILL DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT I CAN USE YET. (Although, to be fair, it's a very nice set of glasses and they are stunningly attractive sitting on my desk.)  

Maybe I was just unlucky, but the lack of communication is really irksome. THAT is something they CAN control. When I have to get glasses again, I think I will try another store, because that is something I can control.

*****5\/11\/2015 UPDATE:  So I called today and they said that they were going to make up a whole new set of lenses. This time, they were super apologetic, and drove to my office to pick up the frames and delivered them to me after the work was done later in the day. Accordingly, I have updated from 1 star to 2 because this was much better customer service than I received before. They still have to work on that communication because during this whole ordeal, I have always been the one initiating contact about this issue.",Shopping
3KeAB3FYD2t7vlmjohQVIg,bLNhF5cDTczxLi0ydufzqw,t_J0tbNB4rmHOb9NBsN5SQ,2012-05-08,"Mary is the best!

I was a teenage girl with one of 'those' friends. She decided my unruly brows needed to go, and go they did. She did them for me the first time and I followed what she did every week after that. For the next five years, I had pencil straight stern eye-brows.

Over the last four years I've been trying to turn things around and slowly tweeze in an arch for myself. Things went okay, and they were looking a lot less botox-chick-with-one-emotion, but they weren't brilliant. A month ago I got sick of trying. I got bangs and let things run wild. Oh man, there be bears in them there woods!

I booked in an appointment with Mary via her website (which is super handy -- you can select when and what time you want to go and her handy-dandy system will tell you what's free) and I arrived this morning super excited. I had also booked myself in for a lash perm (because this is apparently a real thing and I absolutely needed to try it) so I was pretty psyched to see what I would look like leaving the place.

Mary spent a few minutes talking to me and complimenting my ability to grow DeNiro brows in the space of a month. She explained what she was going to do and then got to work, pausing to show me one finished brow before going on to the next. She then pointed out which parts still needed a bit more time to grow in and gave me some awesome, awesome, awesome pointers on filling in those spots in the mean time without making myself look like a clown (something I never managed to figure out on my own!). She even showed me what shade I needed to get. Turns out the one I had been using was about 11 shades too brown. No wonder I looked so angry all the time.

Next up was the lash perm. Oooh, boy! Mary put these little jelly flaps onto my eyelids and proceeded to wrap my eyelashes around a little bump on the bottom of each flap. Then she put on the perming solution, some relaxing, cool cotton pads and left me to nap for a little while. When she came back and put on the second half of the solution she sat and talked with me a while. She is so friendly and easy going, you don't ever get that awkward feeling that she asks all of her customers the same questions without ever really caring about the answer. I think she and my dental hygienist must have gone to the same classes for that skill!

After about 15 minutes she washed everything off and showed me the result. MOTHER OF PEARL. It looked awesome. I was absolutely stunned. I still can't get over how great it looks. And it's going to last two months! Hurray!

In total, my 90 minute appointment was two hours (though I think that had a lot to do with my jungle-brows) and I felt 100% awesome the entire time. The fact that I was all alone and I was the focal point the whole time really made me feel like I was getting something special. Friendly service is one thing, but Mary clearly has a knack for making people feel like VIP.

Pricewise, it's $30 for your first visit for brows and then $25 for maintenance after that. Sure, there are cheaper places, but I'd compare this to a man getting a hot towel shave. You can shave at home with a $1 Bic disposable but the pampering is nice and you know you're getting an excellent job. If you're looking for a quick clean up, and to be in and out in 15 minutes, this probably isn't for you. However, if you're looking for a pro to tell you what your brows should look like and how to get them back to the way nature intended (albeit a little tidier, sharper and cleaner looking) Mary is worth the money. 

The only downside of the entire experience: I high-tailed it to Dufflet Pastries immediately after my appointment (hey, it was lunchtime by that point!) and was helping myself to a sample of their carrot cake when Mary walked in. And by helping myself I mean eating cake (complete with frosting!) with my fingers out of a cup the size of a shot glass. I looked like a total neanderthal and was totally mortified that she had seen me. If my hairy, hairy forehead didn't have her convinced I was unrefined, my cake slurping skills likely did the trick!",Beauty
A3r1BFuwbouD2aiJWEdgLw,0SZy4uieBzBzg54vRdAfgw,P-nqq5kOv2wV2mB5To5elQ,2011-09-14,"Earlier this year, my friend phoned me up randomly on a Sunday morning and said he'd be driving in from Hamilton that day so we should do brunch. Well, all the usual places I go to for brunch are downtown so I went about looking for a place that was a little closer to home - and decided on Glow.  It's a nice place with a beautiful, chic decor and their brunch prices were reasonable ( although edging towards the slightly overpriced side). I've since forgotten what we ate, but we started with Mimosa's (called Morning Glory's on the menu) and ended with their cute little dessert shots.

I came back this past weekend for a family brunch. I had an aunt visiting from L.A. and she is very particular about trying to eat organic, healthy and fresh so I made a reservation for us here. I booked online using OpenTable and the hostess was expecting us when we arrived and greeted  us warmly.

In our party we ordered the following:

Appetizers:
Tomato-Basil Soup: simple, exactly what you'd expect. Not too salty; served with a small slice of baked flatbread with melted cheese.
Grilled calamari: nice alternative to the usual fried stuff. Served with lots of greens & olives bits.

A complimentary Amouse Bouche was brought to the table for us to share. It consisted of house-baked toast with 3 dips: an olive tapanade, hummous and sundried tomato.

Mains:
Philly Cheesesteak Open-Faced Sandwich - hubby devoured this in 5 minutes, so I'll take that as a sign that it was good.
Veal Parmigiana sandwich 
Lobster Mac & Cheese - a bit boring, good bits of lobster in it though.
Stir-fried beef with noodles - a huge bowl of noodles with lots of vegges (and beef or chicken depending on what you choose).

There was nothing outstanding about any of the dishes, yet nothing to complaing about either. I liked that everything was served with a lovely fresh salad.

For dessert all of us had one of their dessert shots - the ones I remember are Smores, Lemon Meringue, Strawberry Cheesecake, Pecan Caramel Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint Mousse, 3-chocolate Mousse. All of them are quite sweet so it's a good thing they are small!

In the summer their patio is open with lots of seating facing a little grassy court. The washrooms and a private bookable dining room are located downstairs, accessible by elevator. I really like that there's a hands-free sensor to open the washroom door (so you don't  have to touch it after washing your hands!). I didn't find service to be slow, but to be honest I was busy chatting away with friends I hadn't seen in a while.

Overall it was a lovely time out, a nice leisurely meal and if the occasion was right, I would come back here.",Restaurant

Was I wowed? Nope. Mind you, we were not guests at the Tower Suites, or their apartment\/villas.. I heard the experience there is like a whole different kind of property.

Yes, there are floor to ceiling windows. Yes, they are big. Yes, the general overall quality of the furnishings and upholstery, bed quality above average. But surprised there were....

SHARP (!!) TVs that are used to partition the sleeping from the lounge area (which was fine.. no wow factor)...no coffee anywhere in the room. What!!!! No coffee, just so you, Steve, can force us to give you even more of our $ and head to the 24 hour Cafe strategically positioned at the corner of the Wynn and Encore? So apparent, and soooo cheap of him.

A minor threat (things are spring loaded) in form of sign that if any item either atop the fridge or inside it is moved or displaced after a period of 60 seconds, patron will be charged a $25 restocking fee. 118F weather. Not able to even chill anything purchased. Just so foolish and ridiculous.

Chinese have a word called "" DAI FONG"". That means, more or less, big-hearted\/generous\/not displaying stinginess n penny-pinching. Mr. Wynn, for having blown $2 BILLION (not to mention the $60 million it took to make the Beach Club and pool materialize to stay competitive), is...

NOT THIS DESCRIPTOR! at least he's not showing it in the small stuff. I was very, very put off by this. 

Facial bar of soap doesn't even lather or possess any kind of emollience. Reminded me so much of those dermatological soaps\/fragrance free, etc... and did not speak ""luxury"" to me; rather, medicine soap! No thanks. Must say, tho,their BAMBU line of lemongrass citrus was off the hook... in the way of shower gel and shampoo, etc.  No daily paper to room. urgh.

The gym. let's not speak of the poor, shoddy ventilation, low ceilings, etc. Though those Cybex machines i enjoy so much are present, and there are chilled water bottles and towels (like other high end hotels.. i.e. Ritz, Aria), it appeared like another room of the spa\/salon area. Strange to work out in such a space. And again.. that
sucky ventilation. Overheard 2 other gentlemen complain about it audibly. 

The gym and spa bathroom are shared. As such, welcome to total luxuriance... a living room, large TV, sofas, faux fireplace, and tea and spa water, fruit found inside of the bathroom.. Yep! and staff linger there too. 

Pool... mostly adults were there. The pool shape and lack of en masse peeps was nice. relaxing to swim and sun... Drinks here were major weaksauce and were made poorly. Mojito and an Arnold Palmer. Ratios didn't balance on either drink. Dont' ask the prices. GULP.

Another separate European pool adjacent. These are completely separate entrances than the Beach Club, with all those famed lilypads and cabanas.

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entrée, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.",Restaurant

I prefer males just because I had a creepy experience with a female I'd rather not conjure up. I was tired of the massages I had been receiving lately. They were too ""fru fru"" and seemed to focus on not seeing your boobs, rather than really dealing with the problem: THAT I WAS FRIGGIN' SORE! I decided no more polite deep tissue massages. I needed a SPORTS MASSAGE. I booked the massage with ""Troy"". He was a good looking guy dressed more business casual then the usual spa scrubs I see and he wore dress shoes that made noise when he walked. He quadruple-checked with me the type of massage I was getting as if there might have been a mistake. After I said yes he said to me. ""Are you ready for this? I just want you to know this isn't a joke."" I laughed thinking he was just ice-breaking, but when he repeated that same question two more times I gulped in fear. I laid on my back first and he massaged my shoulders. OMG! My mind raced to when I trained shoulders last. I could feel the muscle fibers that were torn in the gym reviving by his strong fingers. It was painful, but more like a healing pain. Easy day right? Now lower body. Before he started he felt the need to give me another disclaimer. 

He said, ""Ok Oona, I'm gonna really need you to breathe for this next part."" I laughed, and he didn't. 

Like the sound of thunder, he immediately smacked his hands together like Mr. Miagi on ""The Karate Kid"". I watched in horror as he closed his eyes and began to inhale. ""Oh Sh*#."" I thought. ""What is he about to do?"" Was the upper body just a test to see if I could handle what was to come? He exhaled and looked straight ahead like no one else was in the room. He was in a zone! 

From that moment on for the next 60 minutes---my muscles were the enemy! He clamped his hands together, interlocked his fingers and gained momentum as he landed his sharp elbows into my knots. WTF?! That's a wrestling move! I cried out in pain! He evoked the spirit of the late Bruce Lee and found trigger points that only Mr. Lee would know about! ""Troy"" used all his weight to press down on me. I could hear his dress shoes sliding on the tile as he dug deep. I kept crying out to Jesus but even he couldn't help me! I learned quickly that if I cried out he would go back over those tendons! In fear, I tried desperately to bite down on the linen to silence myself but it never worked. I was now on my stomach. Like the Kama Sutra, he stood behind me, took my leg and bent it over his shoulder until my feet nearly touched my head--exposing a severely stretched muscle. With his elbow he slowly dug deep into the quadriceps tendon. I tapped out hitting my hand over and over on the table. It didn't stop him. He told me to breathe and continued. I told him I couldn't go on without a stress ball--or something! He opened a drawer, pulled out two black smooth stones and put them in each of my hand. Without missing a beat he continued to pull, stretch, knead, and DIG deep into my muscles and tendons. Whoever was in the room next to me must have wondered what was going on? I was moaning, whining, sighing, and cursing. Did someone think we were making a porn?! ""Troy"" was silent the whole time. He was breathing hard as well, had the nerve to be sweating, and in a serial pummeling trance. There was no stopping him! I was also sweating and praying my 90 minutes was up soon. Troy left nothing untouched. He massaged every part of my body except the areas that were CLEARLY off limits. Who would of thought a glute massage would be so painful?! He took his elbow and like a large pointy spoon ""stirred the pot"" repeatedly into my gluteus maximus. Still, he continued to tell me to breathe. Hell! That's all I could do! He finished by massaging my neck and trying to end the session in a relaxed state but there was no relaxing! Things had gone too far and I was traumatized. He asked me how I felt. 

Without hesitation I said tiredly, ""Like...I've been in a...UFC cage fight."" He laughed and told me to drink plenty of water because I was going to be sore tomorrow. I left feeling weird like Bill Cosby just made me a Coke on the rocks. I couldn't explain it but I had no words. It was similar to that damn colonic I had months ago. 

I now had a new acronym for a Sports Massage: SadoMasochist! 

I ended up tipping ""Troy"" the maximum preferred tip. He really did his job. As painful and torturous as it was, he left no muscle behind and I honestly got what I asked for--and then some! I was sore like he said, but once that wore off my body felt....agile. As much as I praise the final results I've yet to book another appointment. In fact I let two months slip by because honestly---I'm afraid! Haha....It's something I have to work myself mentally up to. I'm due for another one this month. Pray for me.",Beauty
qOz_DOBdoIwIoSZdJt6cVA,DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,yPcAdikNrXEsfbHNBQUjkQ,2017-04-24,"Easter Sunday and my boyfriend takes me on a surprise brunch date. I was ECSTATIC when I realized we were going to Zenith. I have driven past this place, literally hundreds of times and probably every single time said ""I really want to go there!""

We waited in line for a minute and chose to seat with another group in order to be seated more quickly. No problem at all. We grabbed ourselves a coffee to start, had some water, ordered an iced tea and our entrees and headed over to the buffet. It was unbelievable how much food was there. With the $11.50 purchase you receive: a drink, the buffet and an entree. How cheap is that?! Here's a list of some of the items I had at the buffet and a description of how delicious they were:

Peanut Noodles- this was most definitely my favorite item on the buffet by far. The cold noodles were so tasty and I couldn't stop eating them. SO DELICIOUS.
Macaroni Salad- reallllllly good. 
Potatoes with a chimichurri sauce- SO GOOD
Broccoli with mushrooms- so good. the broccoli was crunchy and the mushrooms were juicy and packed with flavor
Veggie Orzo salad- YUM. Again, packed with flavor
Fruit salad- fresh and tasty
Spinach & Strawberry Salad- Amazing. 

Do you see a pattern here? Everything was incredible. It was all cold items, and all packed with flavor. I wasn't sure how my carnivorous boyfriend would react to this place, but he and I agreed on every item we tried. In addition to the cold salads at the buffet, they had different bread options, as well as a desert table with pies and tons of cakes. I tried a lemon mint rum pound cake, strawberry vanilla pound cake and a chocolate almond one. ALL of them were so delicious. 

Was that all we ate? Of course not. In addition to the incredible buffet, you get to pick an entree. The list of options weren't too big, about 8 options. I went with the vegan lemon pancakes with strawberry topping. My boyfriend went with the vegan bbq seitan sandwich. I really enjoyed my pancakes- they were SO tasty and moist and just insanely delicious. My boyfriend wasn't as crazy with his sandwich- he ate it and liked it but thought it was a little dry. Both of our meals came with a curried rice, which actually wasn't super good, but it didn't matter, because there were SO many buffet items to compensate for it. 

The most random insanely delicious item we had there? The ICED TEA. It was literally the best iced tea I have ever had. It was just black iced tea, but it was so tasty and bolder than other teas I've had. We were sad we couldn't take a pitcher home with us.

In addition to the food, I LOVED this place because of the experience of it. Chairs and other decor hanging above your head while you eat, different colored rugs on the floor, pictures and other items all over the walls- it was so entertaining to look at everything. After I ate, I walked around the store for a bit to look at the clothes, shoes, jewelry and everything else they had to offer. 

Basically, I'm obsessed with this place. The service was great, the food was unbelievable, the atmosphere was so fun... I am anxiously anticipating when I can return again! :)",Shopping
5swRMtj-zWOjRcwY54SJ7A,bPbFEQGsmmDH0VvL9jCXvg,-sAr-LA9TsIdl37UjwBlvg,2013-05-21,"Okay, so think funky, bohemian, young and friendly. If you come to this hotel comparing it to other hotels or chains you are missing the point. It's like a really cool friend decided to open a hotel and you and your friends descended upon the pool and bar for the weekend. The crowd is primarily young (at least at heart if not age) and very eclectic. In my opinion it is NOT a place for children, so in regards to the last reviewer ""Joe K"" and his comment regarding ""drunk 20-30 something singles hitting on each other"", trust me Joe, it was no picnic hearing squealing kids slashing around and doing back flips in the pool for hours.

The hotel itself is funky and colorful with a good vibe. Reception desk and lobby are nicely decorated with vintage furniture and colorful art. The rooms are pretty much stuck in the 1970's complete with popcorn ceiling and splash of bright red paint to attempt to give it an edge. Don't expect to be blown away and if you're the kind of person that hangs out in the room (why you would, I don't know) as you won't be overly impressed. The reason I gave the review 4 out of 5 was due to the cleanliness. I can pretty much look past dated, wear and tear or even unappealing décor, but cleanness is really high on my list and the overall bathroom and the baseboards really need some serious attention. In my opinion this is where they fell short, which could be a staffing issue or lack of supervision, either way there's no excuse for it and tarnished...but didn't ruin my stay.      

Now as for the restaurant Gallo Blanco, having spent my career in restaurants and hospitality I am thrilled when I'm blown away by the food at a new place and an owner that ""gets it"". The owner (restaurant is separate from the hotel, which made sense when I found out I couldn't sign anything to my room) and his partner clearly know what they are doing and understand both food and service. The shrimp, grilled rib eye, marinated pork and fish tacos are the best I've tasted. The rib eye burrito and Pico Rico burger with fire roasted chiles are off the chart (yes I had three meals there), and the flan was like none I've ever tasted (and before tasting it I wasn't necessarily a big fan of flan). It's apparent that a lot of time and energy went into making the recipes for all of these dishes. The staff is young and up beat without being obnoxious or pretentious. They were all friendly but I have to give a shout out to Natasha and Rebecca made me feel so welcome that other than the food they were part of the reason I kept going back. Again, this goes back to these guys and hiring right. 

All and all I had a fun time and a great meals and will definitely be going back. The rates are very reasonable (which you are occasionally reminded of in a few places that need attention) and there is a bit of a disconnect with the restaurant\/ lobby bar and the hotel itself. I think the hotel needs to step up its game a bit because the vibe, quality and service Gallo Blanco is providing makes the hotels short comings that much more apparent for a hotel guest utilizing all the amenities. I don't say this to bash the rooms, the reception was great and very accommodating, I am simply pointing out there areas that need attention, particularly in housekeeping, and I'm confident that they will take them as constructive. 

Thank you guys....well done!",Beauty

Oh yeah, he is a liar to boot. I am seen by a chronic pain doctor. One of the doctor's offices is in the same plaza, but it isn't the one I usually go to. When you go to a pain doctor you must agree that you will ALWAYS use the SAME pharmacy to fill every med you get. I don't care what it is, you must you THE SAME ONE. I use Target in Tempe. I have a great relationship with them and they always treat me well. Their prices are very good and the personal attention, advise and service you get compared to a Walgreens or CVS is amazing.

I have surgery scheduled for Tuesday. My doctor gave me something to add to my usual meds to help with the pain. Because it is something I never have taken I called Target to make sure they would have it. I was informed that they are having an issue getting the med right now and I might need to try other places since the surgery was Tuesday and today is Thursday. I called my doctor back. I had to get their permission to use another place. They gave me this place and told me many of their patients use it and I have permission to go there. I live in North Tempe. This place is down on Frye Rd and Dobson. So I called the place to see if they have it before I drove down there. The guy said they did. But because his English is about the level of an average New York cabbie I had a hard time understanding something he said. He said bring all of the scripts. I told him I only had one. He said fine.

So I go. I walk in, I am the only one there. I thought this was weird but, ok. He was on the phone so I waited a few minutes. Once he hung up I told him I called ahead and needed this med. He then told me he would not fill it. I asked why? He said that he already told my doctor and they should not have sent me. I was confused. I just wanted to know why. He said unless I was willing to move ALL of my meds from Target to his shop, he was unwilling to fill this med for me! I told him I was only going to need it ONE TIME. It was for 60 pills of a narcotic, NO REFILLS. I have seen other scripts for WAYYYY more than 60. I told him, you know my doctor, you work with a lot of his patients, why is he doing this?

He begins a long angry rant about how he is NOT going to be the shop that is known for giving out pain meds. He is not going to be the ""doctor feel good"" of the area. I told him the script is REAL, he knows my doctor and it is ONE TIME. Why should I move all of my other meds to him just because I need him ONE TIME? He gets angrier and angrier yelling that the DEA and FEDS and STATE POLICE will raid his shop and shut him down and he was not going to do it no matter what so I might as well get out of his shop! I was shocked. I said, PLEASE just call my doctor, you know him PERSONALLY, PLEASE I need this for surgery, can't he help me out.

Long story short, NOOOOOOO. Basically, my honest opinion. He is a greedy jerk and a poor excuse for a human being. Look I GET that their is a HUGE issue with pain med abuse and fake scripts and you have to be safe. But if a customer is willing to have the doctor called to verify it was a REAL script and that no I did not steal or forge the script that would be enough. Nope. To him you are either 100% his or 100% not. This place is no where near where I live and I already have a great relationship with my current pharmacy. No way and I moving my meds to him. He has one location and it closes at 6 pm! NOW WAY!!!

My advise to you, STAY THE HELL AWAY AT ANY COST POSSIBLE!!! If he is willing to be this big of a jerk over one script of 60 pills, God have mercy on your soul if you need something complicated! When I called my doctor to ask what to do next they were shocked too. I told them that he said that he already told them that was the rule and they should have known better to send me anyway. The nurse was SHOCKED. She said he NEVER, EVER, EVER told them that. She was really embarrassed and apologized. She told me if she knew this was his attitude she would have never sent me there. So yes, he is a liar on top of everything else. I think I figured out why his shop was empty!!!! What a frustrating waste of gas, time and my life. I usually am not a vindictive person, but I do believe in Karma.... I will be saying a little prayer that one day this man gets what is coming to him...... like drug resistant hemorrhoids!",Shopping
x5QJCrk7mpvaKpcGoAwnTQ,zGZQVnnYe8K7A8JMzmNpHQ,nD_SylumoZnWevDlWcyGcQ,2013-01-30,"I recently read a review in the Wisconsin State Journal that brought me to 43 North, and I have to agree with the excited tone that the reviewer had.   If you follow my Yelp reviews, you'll know that I consider myself to be quite the savvy diner, so when I found out 43 North had a happy hour running from 5-7, I couldn't stay away.  From drinks to dinner, everything on our bill was 30% off.   They were premiering a new menu a bit different from the one accessible on their website, which seemed to be an improvement.   Most of the dishes have an option of a small or large portion, so if you like to share like we do, it's perfect.

To start, the service was excellent.   We were seated immediately, and our waitress was always pleasant.  We started with the lobster bisque, and they happily split our serving into two portions.  In general, the creamy yumminess that is bisque makes for a great crowd pleaser, but this bisque went a step further by adding whole chunk lobster to the bottom of the bowl, topped with a lobster fritter and surprisingly complimentary marshmallows.  We licked our bowls clean.  

Next we had the beef carpaccio, which was also stellar.  Though the flavor of the beef was a bit masked by the heavy handed olive oil and shaved cheese application, the ingredients were all still incredibly addictive...something I could eat an entire plate of alone.  

Our entrees came out of the kitchen hot, but they were a bit more disappointing.  The game hen was roasted beautifully, but the gnocchi served under the half bird seemed like an afterthought, and had little flavor other than the sweetened sauce that was present over the entire dish.  Hen= crispy and delicious, the rest of the dish= meh, I'm going to save room for dessert.  The scallops with a celeriac puree were also good, but not great.  The scallops weren't properly seared, which is fine with me if the flavors are there...but they missed the mark.  It was impossible to get past the fact that every single bite had sand in it.  I was crunching upon the sea, and wasn't liking it.  The celeriac was delicious, but again, I just couldn't get past the mouth of rocks I got.  I pulled our waitress aside and told her about the issue, and she was very sweet, but I had no idea what I meant when I said there was sand in my food.  ""You mean the texture was off?""  No, sand, like you find at the beach, is in my food.  ""Oh, I'm sorry....""  A friend of mine visited the restaurant one day later, got the scallops, and also experienced the issue.  Either our waitress didn't tell the chef, or the issue wasn't properly addressed.

All of that aside, I will be back to try their other small plates.  I'm a sucker for high-end food at a happy hour price, and 43 North has a place in my Monday night (everywhere else I want to go is closed) repertoire.",Restaurant
h09aaKExbzraxKg-rt310A,MycctOER5yZtixDL64Bz8g,P1mBAGou7nGwNsuz326unQ,2013-12-26,"This is one of those stores I find an excuse to go to the College\/Spadina area for, especially since getting into jazz.

The book and record collections seem good but I go here, like all stores of its ilk, for used CDs*.  (Somebody please wake me up when the 80s-90s end!)

I had stopped in prior to this jazz phase and it was usually a 50-50 chance I'd find something.  Nothing anything terribly rare or WOW!  Wait.  Wait just a second.  That is  lie.  I found a Klaus Schulze double CD here (Essential 72-93) for $16.99.  So yeah, there is treasure to be found here.

My first stop in for jazz left me very impressed.  There were a good dozen gems up for grabs.  Interestingly, the next one yielded zip.  I think there has been one visit since and that bore fruit.  So yeah, this shop is most certainly in my regular rotation for scrounging.

Prices--I feel like this is one of the cheapest shops in the city for your average used CD by a buck or two.  I might be wrong--haven't analyzed it or anything--but if memory serves, it always seems like I'm getting a slightly better deal here.  

I've never tried to sell anything back.

The shop owners (guy and girl--guessing they are married) are nice and friendly and will chat if you want to.  I like the idea of supporting them.  My guess is that they are locals and have been so most of their lives.

Highly recommended!

*2nd bonus Boxing Day 2013 rant of the day!
If you have been reading my reviews--I have no idea if anyone is--this site really needs a view counter--then you know by now that I'm way into buying used CDs.  When most people have gone back to proper records, or forward to MP3s, why am I still stuck on CDs?

A proper response to such a question would probably take the form of an essay and perhaps not a short one.  So here are a few summary points:

1.  Nostalgia.  This is the medium I grew up on.  As a preteen\/teen, back at the end of the 80s and until the 90s, vinyl was dead.  A lot of albums were only released on CD.  In fact, I still remember long boxes.  There was no vinyl culture, at least not in suburban Los Angeles.  The CD was king and naturally all of my purchases were on this format.

2.  Ease.  CDs can take a beating.  They are easy to clean.  And easy to store!  Compared to records they are smaller, hold more music and last way longer.  A CD, from 1985, assuming no scratches, sounds identical today.  Playing records actually destroys the surface of the record, albeit microscopically.  The idea of a record NOT lasting forever boggles my mind.

3.  Availability--well, mostly.  While there is lots and lots of great music that will never make it from old records onto a CD, there is no shortage of excellent music on CD.  And right now, with everyone moving their collections to MP3, it is a golden age for the used CD buyer.  You can find nearly anything you want, in good condition, for a good price.  

4.  If I don't pay for something, it is hard for me to take it seriously.  I just can't ""love"" an MP3--they just seem worthless to me.  They don't exist.  They are just 0s and 1s.  (I know CDs are too but on top of a physical format).

5.  There is no joy in collecting MP3s.  Ok, I guess there is some aspect of having to hunt down various sources but you don't have to leave your living room.  As a CD collector, I have to get out there and get my hands dirty in the used bins.  Or I have to track things down online.  ""Nothing worth having comes easy"", right?

6.  CDs are like the best of both worlds.  They sound as good^ (no pops, clicks, hiss, skips, etc.) as MP3, are as easy to use as MP3s* but are still a physical medium.  You still have to handle something.  You still get to go to your collection, find a CD to play, insert it into the player and press play--while not as tactile as vinyl, your hands still get to do something.  (I spend my entire working day in front of a computer--no need to spend any more time in front of one once I get home)

7.  CDs (like records) are finite.  That is, you press play and listen to a single album, as it was meant to be heard.  This is a hard one to explain to non music geeks but some of us actually don't like, at least not all of the time, the idea of non stop music in the form of random tracks that were only recorded as singles.  

8.  CDs, unlike records, are fuss free when it comes to playing as well.  No need to adjust, no concerns about your tonearm or cartridge.  You just press play.  

^Yes, yes, yes.  I am very familiar with the argument that CDs sound ""cold"" and not ""warm"" like a record, especially in the early days of CDs.  With a tube based amp and a modern, audiophile level CD player, this argument has largely gone away.  Besides, many people argue that the CD sounds better as it can store more of the ""data"" (higher res) and bring out that performance when played on good equipment.

*OK, CDs are not portable like MP3s.  I can't argue this one--and this is why even I have an old iPod for travel.",Shopping

Before that, I've only visited the resort and casino for their awesome Studio B Buffet. They sent me a postcard not too long ago for two free consecutive nights so that was our perfect excuse to head out to Sin City. I called their 1800# and gave them my promo code and my reservations were set for a Sat check in, Mon check out. All went smoothly with just one call.

We drove in on Saturday around noon. As expected, they didn't have any readily available rooms for us at that moment so they say. Not a big issue. Had the bellhop guys take our bags and we went straight for the table to burn time. I checked back occasionally and the lady at the front desk told me the room was not ready yet so I went back to burning more dough. Finally, we checked again around 3 something and the room was good to go. It wasn't a big deal and we knew we were kind of early to check in but when they said they would phone us when the room was ready, they never did. Minor issue and I wasn't about to throw a tantrum especially when our stay was going to be on the house anyway.

What I did notice was that the staff here went out of their way to call us by our last names. From the front desk, to the bellman, to the pit bosses. It was always ""Mr. B."" I think it's in their training module to not treat guests like cattle and that you must greet them by their names. This was quite welcoming. I have many letters in my (Thai) last name and I know that it might be hard to pronounce so I give them mad credit for always trying. 

The rooms were spectacular and surprisingly awesome. We had a view of the pool and the strip. The room was clean, modern, and sexy. Bose Ipod docking station, flat screen, remote for the curtains, but what tipped the iceberg was their bathroom. Two separate sinks, a mini tv built into the mirror, separate shower with a bench inside, and the sexiest item in there was their bathtub. The bathtub faced out into the room through a window which had a controlling blind system in case you don't want people in the room to see you doing your business. But if you're chillin' in the tub, you can be looking through the room and staring out into your view. I will post pics to show an example. Floor to ceiling windows AND a complimentary lip balm.

Environmentalists will appreciate the following. If you choose to not have your sheets and towels changed out, then they ask you to hang this green sign outside your door. As an incentive to help mother earth, they will slip a $5 spend anywhere credit in the hotel coupon. We used this downstairs at Baby Cakes Bakery the next morning to get one of their tasty ice-blended lattes. 

My only gripe would be the obvious flaw to the M Resort which is their location. It's about 20 minutes south from the main Vegas strip. Meaning if you want to go party it up and get smashed, you're more than likely going to have to take a long cab ride to and from the hotel unless you have a car and designated driver. Other than that, if you prefer to detach yourself from all the hustling and bustling from the main strip, then you may appreciate the isolated location. 

I can only say great things about my experience with staying here. I definitely would return if they threw another offer at me again or if the rates were great. What more can you ask for? Friendly staff, clean and elegant hotel, and some good dining options: Hash House a Go-Go, Studio B Buffet, Baby Cakes Bakery just to name a few. 

Many thanks to the staff and to the hotel for hooking us up with our most recent stay.",Beauty

I've stayed at several JW's across the country and other ""nicer"" resort hotels so I'm comparing them to their competitors and peers.  If you're asking me to compare them to Comfort Suites or Hampton Inn of course they're better but I digress.  

My wife and I decided to stay for a night last weekend.  I travel constantly and stay with Marriott and SPG brands so I'm very versed in their loyalty program and perks.  Our first sign that this property wasn't up to snuff was at check-in.  They have a beautiful lobby and large check-in area.  We headed to the ""elite"" check-in area which was surprisingly large and staffed with 3 agents.  The other main check-in area was staffed with as many if not more.  Wow, this place is busy!  Unfortunately the wait to check-in was quite lengthy and I grew impatient.  Finally it was our turn and I let the agent know that I had already completed the on-line check-in.  Normally they notify you thru the app when your room is ready but they hadn't assigned us a room yet so she scoured the system before finding one for us.  Note to Marriott, there were plenty of rooms ready she said, they just weren't assigned yet.  Not impressed.

Despite booking a regular room we were ""upgraded"" to a room with a view of the golf course facing south.  The room was fine, standard JW Marriott furnishings and amenities.  Unfortunately we felt like we had walked to Tucson by the time we got there, yes I'm exaggerating but picture being in Vegas at the end of the hallway furthest from the elevator.  Yup, that was us.

Ok, despite all of this I could still say we were fine and ready to go and check out the pools and float around the lazy river.  We walk out to the pools and are greeted by a security check point and once approved made to wear a wrist band. Wow, really?  Come to find out that area kids often ""sneak into"" the pool area to use the facilities. Oh well, it is what it is we thought. We set our stuff down and walked into the lazy river. UGH...wall to wall tubes all filled with people in them. Seriously, we stood there for 10 mins before giving up hope. What the heck is going on here?

We grabbed our belongings and headed up to the other pools. They were each fairly packed except for one where we were able to find a 5' circle of ""privacy"". After a couple of rounds of drinks though my wife and I had seen enough and headed back to our room. Not impressed we said to each other lamenting our intro to the JW. 

Dinner and drinks were ok but not great that night and in the morning we watched the final round of the British Open on tv from our bed before checking out and heading home. We both had seen enough the day before and would rather spend the day in our pool at home than to deal with that chaos again. 

A few key points:

The hotel sells ""day passes"" which attract local Phoenicians who maybe don't have a pool at home. How many do they sell per day?  No idea but based on our experience it's a LOT!

Like most resorts the JW charges an exorbitant resort fee per night. Get ready for it. 

That resort fee doesn't cover valet parking either. Be ready to shell our additional for that as well. 

The resort fee does cover driving range balls and access. That's a really nice perk if you're looking to hit a few while staying here. 

The golf course offers junior golfers free golf after 3:30pm with a paying adult for guests. That's a nice deal if you're bringing kiddos!",Beauty

Looking for a decent location for a day spa in the Markham area, Silver Leaf is conveniently on the border of Toronto and Markham. It's a bustling area with ample parking space.

Quality and Price: An RMT massage is $95 + tax. I went in for a full body Swedish stress relief massage. The price is slightly above average across the board (for massages and mani\/pedi). 

Service: Prior to arriving, I called ahead to inquire about walk-ins or appointments. RMT massages are by appointment only but on a weekday, it's pretty quiet so it was very easy to book the day of. On arrival, I was greeted by young hosts. They were friendly and kind, took my coat and handed me a form to fill out (as it was my first time at this location). The process was quick and smooth. The waiting area was clean and neat. Smaller than it looks in the photos but, hey, that's what professional photography will do right? 

My masseuse came to retrieve me at my scheduled appointment time (I was slightly early but she didn't mind). Her name was Liliya and she was just lovely. She asked if I wanted to go to the bathroom (and I declined) but neglected to tell me that I could store my belongings in the lockers next to the bathroom. I ended up taking everything with me and discovered it later (after asking for a tour of the facilities). No big deal, I just ended up putting my clothes, shoes and purse on the counter in the massage room.

The actual massage met my expectations. Liliya distributed enough pressure that was just right for me (not to soft not too rough).  She did well with modesty draping and checked in on me from time to time. Liliya got most of the tension in my upper back and shoulders, she did well with the extremities (palms of hands and arch of foot) but I felt she spent a little too much time on my lower half (legs). I originally specified that my upper back and shoulders were the most tense so I would have liked if she spent more time on it. She massaged my head\/scalp a great dea l(be prepared and don't expect to leave with perfect hair!) Another issue that I came across was that after she had massaged my lower half (including the soles of my feet), she came up and massaged my face! Firstly, the facial massage was great, don't get me wrong. She pressed all the right points of pressure, but it was right after she used those fingers to press on the balls of my feet and toes!! It was a good thing I had just showered before my appointment, what if I had come from a long day of work?! Gross.

After the session, she asked if I would like some water with orange or cucumber and met me back at the front desk. I sat and sipped my water while checking messages. I spent some time evaluating the establishment during that time and ended up purchasing an OPI polish that was 50% off by the front desk. 

I paid, asked for a receipt and then a tour. The tour was very brief and gave me a general idea of what the spa is like. It fairly small and cozy, but finishes are modern and neat. 

Overall: A decent day spa located in the GTA. I may return again if I don't find anything better in this area. Points of improvement for the spa is to include some small freebies, even for a la carte clients. For example, as much as I appreciated the water, would have been nice to have a little variety, maybe some cookies, or juice instead of water while I waited.  Maybe an ""after session routine"" instead of just straight back out to the front desk for payment. I was hoping for something to ""bring be down to earth"" after my massage. But then again, I could be way too spoiled from my experiences at other spas. One good thing about the spa was that no one tried to pressure or sell anything to me. Also, ensure that all specialists direct clients to the bathroom\/locker area (or are informed of storage) upon arrival. All in all, a good spa for the area (I'd say they have some competition if there were located closer into the city), and a peaceful atmosphere.",Beauty
t9_coAJvNnc9LpU-NWoF2w,CZvAt-h0YkNvA4spte0MkA,Rad2dB1SQj9LLKRLNqqf0A,2017-09-01,"Moon Valley Nurseries used to my favorite and most trusted garden and plant experts. I thought I could count on them to get the job done and help me in areas where they were the experts. Our current home is in desperate need of a facelift in terms of curb appeal and I would love to have a proper garden that is easy to maintain (back and front) and looks great. 

I had been to Moon Valley Nurseries previously for things here and there, and was finally ready to take the plunge and figure out how to start with a landscaping project. I reached out to Moon Valley Nurseries on their chat client and was put in touch with Kyle who is apparently (you will see why I say apparently later) the Digital Nursery Pro & Customer Service Rep. He said he needed more details and would be happy to provide me with pricing on the items I was looking for and provided me with his e-mail. I took the time to write a detailed e-mail with everything we had discussed online (complete with pictures and measurements), and made sure to send it the same day so the conversation would be fresh in his mind. 

10 days passed and I heard nothing from Kyle, I sent a message asking if he received my e-mail and he advised he had and claimed the previous messages went to his spam. Kyle's response was brief, uninformative, and generic - he didn't answer a thing and I was no further ahead then, than 10 days prior. I responded the very next day, asking Kyle if he got my full e-mail as it seemed my questions weren't answered, and asked if he could take the time to provide me with further details. I waited and waited and never heard a thing again. So much for being a customer service representative. 

On August 10th 2017 I filled out the contact us form on the Moon Valley Nurseries website, asking for some assistance. I indicated I was dealing with Kyle previously, but he never got back to me and I would really appreciate if they could put me in touch with someone who could answer my questions. I indicated I was hoping to work with them for my landscaping project, and without any help I can't exactly do so. I also expressed how disappointing and frustrating the process has been so far. Again I heard nothing back and the site clearly showed my inquiry went through. 

On August 24th 2017 I noticed a survey on the Moon Valley Nurseries website, and I filled it out because I figured this lack of service was not right - I expressed my frustration again and provided them with details on my experience thus so far. I was hoping this information would allow them to correct a major customer service error that I and others may be experiencing. Clearly there is something not right with their approach to customer service and getting landscaping projects off the ground. 

On August 25th 2017 a miracle happened, I heard from Sam the Online Nursery manager who asked how he could help and what questions I had. I forwarded my previous e-mail chain from Kyle to him - because quite frankly I wasn't going to re-write the whole thing. I asked him to review it and if he could provide me with the answers I had been waiting for. Sam and I sent a couple of e-mails back and forth a week ago and said he would like to stop by and take a look at the property to get some ideas and assist me better. He asked for my address to help coordinate a date, to which I provided and again I heard nothing more. 

I have to say at this point I am really tired of chasing after people to even get basic information or get a plan together for landscaping my yard (not to mention all the missed deals and promotions that have passed over time). As a customer looking for help, I shouldn't be the one doing all the follow up and chasing after people here. I can say if I was Sam handling my file, I would make sure the customer was taken care of and not let the lack of communication that happened previously happen again. 

For a company that claims that their professionals will help create a landscaped yard and you won't have to lift a finger, this has yet to be seen. On their about page they boast about their customer service, but I have experienced everything but. There just aren't enough excuses for why two representatives never got back to me, and why I never received a response from the contact us page inquiry on August 10th. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in Moon Valley Nurseries and there is no excuse for neglecting a customer like this. I have done everything in my control to correct this matter, and been very patient.

I would strongly recommend if you do not want an exercise in futility like I had, that you look elsewhere for committed and customer service centric professional landscapers.",Shopping
TSFnbghULunwPZbkycXhXg,HNvtQAbgSeLBSkmXz2AkSg,hggVnGwA5042-ABxqeJX-A,2013-11-11,"Many of my area foodie-cronies oft-hail Good Food as ""the best restaurant in Charlotte"". Though it's located but a stone's throw from my office, I had never taken the opportunity to dine there. Perhaps because of the heavy, universal praise it receives I had relegated it to some mythic status worthy only of an extremely special occasion. Through the birthday wishes of my esteemed friend Katherine, however, my hand was forced, and on a breezy Tuesday evening in October I finally cracked Good Food's threshold. 

We had on this night a crew of seven, which pushes the limits of Good Food's per-table capacity - but though they take no reservations, they easily and quickly accommodated our party (just by glancing through the restaurant's open front glass as I walked up past the posh little stuffed-sofa lounging area on the patio out front, I had taken note of the bustling little bar and seemingly cramped dining space and pessimistically doomed-and-gloomed us to not getting a table any time soon - way to prove me wrong, Good Food!). We were seated in the back near rear the rear exit and greeted promptly by our server...

If I may break from my review narrative for a moment and go on a not-colorful tangent: Our waitress was extraordinarily pregnant. I'm not sure why I found this so troubling, but it vexed me greatly. While I completely understand an expectant mother's need and desire to continue working and earning money while gestating a child, that somehow doesn't gel well with a dining experience. In my mind, very-pregnant women should not be on their feet serving me food and drinks. It's odd. It makes me feel like a jerk. I wanted so badly to offer her my chair and maybe even go so far as to extend to her the courtesy of foot massage. Yet, circumstantially, most would argue that that would have been an odd thing to do. I felt like I was in a weird social trap with no chivalrous outlet. So, ultimately, I just sat up really straight and tried not to curse too much. 

Back to the review: Good Food's dining area is nothing short of ""adorable"" - the quotes are for implying a sort of quaint\/artsy\/charming\/small aspect to that adorability. It is dim and loud, with various eras of exposed brick lending their geometry to the perimeter, browns and yellows and old bronze colors filling the whole of the palette, and ornate crossworks of fused forks and spoons and knives creating the lightshades and wall-art. There's nothing exceptional about the decorations of the space itself, but it all coalesces into being very successful at establishing what it means to. 

Drinks here trend toward wine and fancy cocktails, not surprisingly, but there are a handful of well-selected local beers available as well. I tried the elderflower martini - it burned soft and was cleverly earthy, but somehow felt unbalanced. On subsequent rounds I just ordered NoDa brewing's Hop Drop n Roll. The beer felt uncouth for the situation, but it's what I wanted.  

Katherine, being the expert on Good Food's multi-round-small-plates ordering methodology, got us started with some pomme frites, a couple hot little dishes of steamed broccoli and battered cheddar, and a rather fancy cheese plate. All served quickly, all tasty, and all presented cleanly without pretense - I appreciate a subtle plating. Yet, I was not quite impressed.

For a ""main course"", my ladyfriend and I went splitsies on the seared scallops and a daily special of grouper served atop mixed veggies. Others at our table opted for the gnocchi or the garganelli pasta - which we all bandied about and sampled from incautiously, which seems to be the way of Good Food. Again, each dish was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, and promptly served... but I was still not quite impressed. 

Katherine, now five martinis in and guffawing heartily at AJ's even silliest quips, was ready for more and so we commenced desserts. We all shared spoonsful of a decadent chocolate-and-peanut butter brownie cake type thing as well as a so-sweet-it-hurt strawberry cheesecake. With these I was nearly impressed - but I'm hardpressed to qualify desserts as a reason to elevate a restaurant's food-status. 

After paying our three-hundred-dollar tab, we left feeling happy, not too full, and a little bit buzzed. Which I supposed is a very grown-up alternative to the stuffed-and-wasted condition through which my friends and I usually stumble our way out of a restaurant. 

In the end my assessment is that while good, Good Food is not great. There are a dozen restaurants in Charlotte that, in my mind, are just as tasty for half the price and twice the fun. But I also accept that perhaps, gluttonous and ravenous that I am, I might not be Good Food's ideal patron. If you're sophisticated, overpaid, and perpetually on a diet... this is probably the best restaurant in Charlotte.",Restaurant
5CHfUlH2pHDtB5jPMsYb2A,kHEQu2K4TIiXdw7Onj9TIw,E8kRMoIZd8NrpZd57b2JmQ,2017-08-24,"We first called Greencare pools on March 15th which I decided to document if this company could make me happy as I am an avid Yelper yet they had a bad rating. So why would I use them? Well, the reason I called is they were referred by 3 people on my street whom all were ecstatic and their pools were all built by Greencare and beautiful. So I decided let's see what this Greencare phenomenon who seem to be building all the pools on my street and who seems to be building pools in several of the surrounding neighborhoods is all about. They have to be doing something right?

The girl on the phone was pleasant and set us up with a designer who was Brandon a few days later. She also followed the call up with a very informative email which had links to videos of pools with real customers raving about the service they received from Greencare. I thought this was very well thought out and a nice touch. I watched several of the videos in which they are clearly genuine pools completed with real homeowners. I felt good at this point and was looking forward to what they came up with for my space.

After a few meetings I would definitely recommend Brandon if you are looking for a designer that understands a budget and how to maximize the design while staying on whatever your budget is (ours was $65,000.00 that's what Greencare got us financed for) Brandon was easy to work with and helped guide us to make the right decisions to maximize our space. We went in and he and Jesse designed the pool in the office making changes we requested right then. Brandon explained all the people that worked at Greencare and why he chose to work with Greencare. It was quite moving to be honest. It seems this was a really hard working group of people from what he said on the first meeting. Then when we went to the office you could really tell this was a busy construction office but all were very polite and seemed very genuine to us. We were so blown away with the whole company we went ahead with the project March 22nd. They dug the pool 3 days later!

Prior to digging, they sent an informative email reviewing the whole construction process which we took the time to read.  I highly recommend reading this and then being patient because if you do the whole process isn't that bad. But then again who wants their backyard virtually upside down for the better part of 4 months! Another item we received in the mail was a pool manual for building a pool that had all the stages listed in a table of contents with photos and explanations of each stage. Keep this handy during the build it put my mind at ease as well!

We had a tough time picking out tile and finish for our pool so Jessica whom is an absolute gem and sweetheart that does all the scheduling sent us right to the tile store where we had thousands of selections to choose from. We also chose the Tahoe blue for pool finish and couldn't be happier with the finished result. The color of our pool is just incredible.

Our build process mostly stayed on schedule, most of the delays were due to weather.  There was a time period in which a previous phase wasn't completed before a new one started, but after reaching out to Greencare they got it taken care of pretty quickly.  That phase was the tiling and that took unexpectedly long.  Our project manager Gary Morris did a good job keeping us informed and I appreciate the regular emails from Jessica telling us what was going on and what the next step was.   

The final step was pool start up whom Nathan showed us how to work the pool and maintain it after it was filled, he was very helpful.  We did have a minor issue in the first month which he handled right away.   The issues we encountered, that were both addressed immediately, were a broken heater (valve?) and our vacuum has gone haywire twice.  Both issues were dealt with immediately and fixed.  

All in all, I gave Greencare 5 stars because with a pool build there are going to be hiccups it's how they are addressed and in the end, if they do what they say they will and Greencare did. There are only 10 homes on my street and Greencare has now completed five pools which 3 homes are not yet built so with me and the other two pools that are under way by guess who...Greencare...They have done the whole street! Again I can't voice enough the road to a new pool has had a few bumps along the way, but whenever we've raised an issue with Greencare, they've quickly responded and handled each and every situation, which is why I'm rounding up.  Thank you Greencare and keep up the good work. One more message to your whole team over there. I was thoroughly impressed with all of you. Don't let the world get to you because you just can't make everyone happy in this world but you sure did make me and my whole darn street happy! Nicely done!",Shopping

My & my gf moved here from San Antonio, Texas to attend ASU in Tempe.  We live in Ahuatukee on the I-10 two exits away.  We used to go to Whataburger all the time.  This must be a Texas obsession, because I BARELY see any around.  Anyway!  The minute we saw the sign where it said ,""Coming Soon, Rudy's."" WE BOTH FREAKED OUT, & said, ""Oh My God, Rudy's is coming here!?  Shut the hell up!""  Then we waited, & waited, & waited some more......  Then one day I see that it is completely built & there are employees walking around the place.  Almost there.  Finally, Grand Opening!  Immediately after getting out of work I go directly to Rudy's to wait in the MASSIVE line snaking around the building.  There must have been more than 100 people in that line easy.  We did not care.  We proudly wore our Rudy's 20th Anniversary shirts that we had from back home.   

Former & current Texas residents imagine this:  I used to live literally across the street from the Rudy's that was serving Sea World on US HWY 151.  Yup, right there.   And I went often.  Sometimes even with my sportbiker crew that I rode around with.  Rudy's is the absolute sh**.  My gf & I always talk about how we miss Rudy's & she even had her parents ship her the bottles of Rudy's Sause.  That's how much we loved that place.  So there we are on opening day waiting about 30 to 45 minutes for pure goodness.  Then we get to the front of the line.   I love how the staff yells.  They did that at in San Antonio, too, but these guys are super loud.   Love that.   We did notice that the sides items (coleslaw, potato salad, etc...) are all prepackaged in styrofoam cups in refrigerators which is nice.  They stay cold in there.  Good idea.  Also, we noticed that there was no pickles on the menu.  Rudy's in San Antonio always charged us for pickles that they sliced & served us.  We were very disappointed at first.  We even asked an employee that happened to be from Laredo, TX & she was not aware of the pickles at all.  She might have never gone to Rudy's is why.   Oh well.

Anyway, we get our food in a bottle crate on wax paper, (THIS IS THE WAY IT HAS BEEN DONE IN TEXAS FOR THE LONGEST TIME SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOUGH!)  All non-Texans just do not get it & they probably never will.  Oh well, their loss if they never go back.  
So we start walking to the condiment bar & lo & behold there were the pickles!  Free of charge.  Yay!  We nearly yelled at the girl for telling us she knew of no pickles.  Pickles is something you don't play with when it comes to Rudy's.  You NEED to have pickles with your Rudy's barbeque, people!  No butts about it.  We have a laugh with the girl & the manager about the misunderstanding.  And by the way, that awesome manager, Marcus is the absolute Bomb dot com.

So at last we sit down on the old country benches to eat.  The moment of truth.  I like to refer to this moment as ""P.H.E."" PURE HEAVENLY EUPHORIA.  

Just as others have said, the brisket is tender, the chicken is tasty, the sausage... oh my.   Wonderful sausage links marinated in Godly flavoring.  Another difference here:  They not only give you white bread with your meal, but you now have a choice of enriched wheat bread.  Lovely.  

I happen to love the sissy sauce.  I think it's just right for my spicy sensitive 
tongue.

One more difference I took notice of.  I used to order the chopped meat back home.  It used to contain a little bit of everything like chicken, pork, & beef.  All mixed in Rudy's Sause.  Not here.  I asked the employees, & they did not know of this of course.  They said they didn't carry it.   Only the pure chopped beef.  That's okay.  Because I love that all the same, regardless.  

I can say that the best meal here would be a quarter pound of chopped beef, potato salad, coleslaw, wheat bread, & either a Big Red or a Coke.  PHE all the way, baby.  

There's no way Rudy's is getting anything less than five stars.  We missed you Rudy's.  We welcome you back into our lives.

That was only two weeks ago.  We've been back 4 times since then.",Restaurant

This property is off the strip, but only 9 miles North-West from the South Strip: the great restaurants are just 10 minutes away, using the direct Summerlin Parkway and South 15 Freeway.

This is a true Oasis with great Spa and Golf opportunities. A peaceful refuge, perfect for those of us who don't like to be surrounded by a massive lazy sweaty crowd all the time. This hotel used to be the Regent Las Vegas, but the Regent (5-star) chain decided to sell the property to Marriott. The star rating is kept, but the prices are not as outrageously inflated as those of the Wynn, Venetian, Caesar's Palace, Bellagio or any of the other big names.

The hotel features 2 buildings. We always prefer to stay at the Spa Tower, where the main reception desk is, because the other one is a bit far away (10 minutes walk or so). The hotel has around 460 rooms, which is about 1\/3 the amount of rooms at the South Strip hotels. This means that you don't have to walk a hundred yards to reach your room. And a little bit more personal attention...

5 floors total, surrounded by lovely Golf Course and with a view towards the mountains in the North-Western part of Las Vegas. A decent size casino with very friendly atmosphere, not too smoky, and quite new looking. The Spa is called Aquae Sullis and features any type of massage or treatment. It also has a full modern gym, sauna, and hot tubs outdoors. The swimming pool has an interesting irregular shape and is good for families and lounging, but it can be also used to do some laps if you are really enthusiastic (in my case, I get too lazy, especially with 110 degrees)... There is a bar that serves beer, cocktails and soft drinks. And some burgers \/ salads \/ Mex junk foods, which I really don't recommend!

The rooms are some of the biggest in Las Vegas. The bedding is of highest quality, ergonomic, firm but comfortable, very clean. 2 choices: 1 King size bed, or 2 Queen beds. All rooms have a coffee-maker with some free coffee, wet bar with refrigerator, 36 inch TVs with cable (latest hollywood stuff and lots of porn..), a walk-in closet with large safe deposit box (electronic personalized code), iron\/board, fan light with dimmer, 2 Bath Robes, etc. Oh, and high-speed internet (via ethernet cable)- unlimited access costs $10 per day- also a decent value for Vegas.

The bathrooms are larger than the room itself; they feature a very pleasant clean Warm-White or Napoli Yellow marble. First thing you see when you enter is a huge 3- or 4- person triangular Jacuzzi bath-tub, surrounded by mirrors. Bring your own Bath Salt, candles & champagne. AND YOUR LOVER, gees. A separate shower, all brass, with Rainshower + conventional shower head... Toilet is of course separated, with a door for more privacy.

So... Get crazy! Take long baths, shave, epilate, squeeze oils out of your nose (using the provided electric magnifying mirror), or simply poop away in perfect harmony while listening to your favorite TV show or some music via the wall-mounted speaker, connected to your TV (with a volume control knob...). A phone is also thoughtfully provided next to the john, in case if you feel sudden urge to call yo mama! Shampoo, Rinse, Shower Gel, Moisturizing Body Lotion, Mouth-wash and 2 French Milled Soaps are provided daily.

This hotel has also some decent restaurants, even though, we never really got to check them out. By the way, they also serve Starbucks coffee in the lobby, often, and have a Starbucks within the complex- next to the spa and casino...

I recommend avoiding Vegas in the hottest summer days, unless you are a sucker for sauna & scorching heat... we returned yesterday driving through the Mojave Desert and temperature outside was 122 degrees F... ouch. I was scared by the thought ""what if my car breaks down... what if my air-conditioner dies on me?""... anyway...

But definitely give this hotel a try. Bring your signif. other + some aromatic massage oils, candles, insence, champagne... When you do the reservation, you may be able to find discounted deals via the Marriott websites. They have AAA etc. discounts, and often they include a free pizza or movie into the deal (AKA family package). For the same price on Travelocity, Expedia or Hotels(dot)com you get nothing extra.

ekUAJ8mLl3Hj0HSONj-SxQ,0KueNf7UhBqpLBKbTQi5uw,L64JAuPA8_CgjAqvnO6JBg,2011-05-02,"oh my, where to begin?
This was a pretty dang bad dining experience. unfortunately, it wasn't a lot of the 'just a bad night' kind of things...it was poor management and incredibly horrible product.

let's begin, shall we?

First of all, it was late. I was heading home from a gig and there's not a lot open for food at that hour (10:30-11pm). We saw a Montanas in the same area, and we like Montanas, but decided that we'd try Lone Star as a change.

i dropped in quickly to make sure they were still open, even tho the sign outside said they were open till midnight. (Hey, things change, etc...late night is never a guarantee)

Not a single employee to be found. A few patrons. Some loud hip hop being cranked on the stereo system.  No servers, no bartenders, no one at the counter...I looked around the restaurant (didnt' just stay at the front desk).  Finally I saw a server clearing a table and practically had to run after her she was so uninterested in what was going on.  ""Yeah, they're open for another hour""

Great...so we park, come in.  Restaurant is closed but could we eat int eh bar.  sure.  One table available...underneath the speakers.  Cranking that same horrible hip hop\/urban pop.  

Nevermind, we're hungry.

It was only a little annoying when the server\/bartender (an elvish little number, with CFM cut offs, boots and basically a redneck Hooters look) decided to fall into her obviously well rehearsed semi-flirtatious litany of quick bar choices.  I mean, she was a little too flirty for 2 obviously gay men ( aka we were dressed better than the rest of the guys in there, trimmed our nose hairs, and went to the gym).

Nevermind, we're hungry.

Bartender makes a crack about her DM being there, else she would join us for a margarita.  She made this crack to every other table within earshot, incidentally.

Curiously enough, we figured out who the DM was: the loud obnoxious drunk guy in the bar with his buddies partying.  Delightful!

Waitress who delivered our food dumped a whole bowl of sauce on my partner.  He was wearing a brand new Under Armour shirt.  They brought him plenty of 'moist towlettes'....okay, finally a wet washcloth.  yup, it was ruined (which we didn't discover till we got home & soaked it).  I had bought it for him cuz it was red and looked great.  Nordies.  Expensive.  The waitress said she'd take care care of his meal. When the bill came, waitress was gone, we informed the bartender\/server.  The DM came back and gave us *half* off *one* of the meals.

Yeah...$6 off after ruining a  shirt.  Nice! 

Other exciting highlights:
- Service was sporadic.  we noticed that for a long period of time, the bartender\/server (aforementioned provocatively dressed female), the DM and 2 of the DM's friends (a rather unseemly bunch) returned together from the back 'employees only' area of the bar.  Bwahahahaha.  you know, in the strange way that you immediately think of drug deals\/use or sexual favours.  Not saying that was going on, but the sheepish looks on faces, the body language, the innnnnteresting situation of ALL the working members of the restaurant being off the floor at the same time....?  Puhleeez

- The place is Tex Mex...I had the Tijuana burrito. Someone should give their marketing people a map.  I'm sure y'all know that TJ is not near Texas. If you're unaware of that fact, then I'm sure you'll miss the tidbit that TJ doesn't really enter into the scope of 'TexMex'.  (""It's in Mexico"", as my Canadian native partner stated (I live about 14 miles from TJ incidentally))  TexMex & TJ style Mexican food are QUITE different.  durrrrrr

- Oh, and btw - The TJ burrito was nasty.  It was barely seasoned ground beef. And i'm unsure how they found jalepenos that had absolutely no flavour at all, but somehow they exist.  not that I was expecting a capsacin orgasm at a chain restaurant, but it was just tragically....bad.

- Random and various disturbing restaurant frights: Sticky floor, dirty tables, filthy window sills.  I'm amazed we didnt' get food poisoning actually.

So, about a $60 meal, plus a shirt ruined  for having our eardrums assaulted, our sensibilities accosted, insulted, required to put up with loud obnoxious drunks because of the fact he is the District Manager (!) and fed barely edible gristly crap presenting itself as ""TexMex""

you'd think Texas would sue them for food slander

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!
You have been warned.

No wait, it could almost be kitschy like a tragic dive bar...or the gastronomic equivalent of the Jerry Springer show.  Then again, you may like the Jerry Springer show...and crappy food.  Enjoy!",Restaurant
DY11dcv1DDBonNYI3qE3hg,75ZIgkBYYTvHdeUHcg3tMg,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,2017-05-22,"We used to go to this other donut place close to our house, but have stopped patronizing them because of their rude costumer service. Last Mother's Day, my hubby asked me where I wanted to go, and since I have been craving donuts and had the donut bar bookmarked for a while, I asked to go here. It was quite a bit of a drive considering we live in southwest, but we decided to go anyway. We got here around 12:30-1ish, and they only had a few selections left. Don't know if it was because it was Mother's Day, but the lady behind the counter informed us that because of the limited selection, we could get a box for $10 and fill it with as much donuts as we could fit. Although the creme brûlée donut was sold out and it was slim pickins, we were still able to get a decent amount of very yummy donuts. What would normally be a donut worth $3 a pop, we were able to get a full box for only $10! My favorite amongst our choices was the caramel latte donut. I thought it would have been too sweet, but it was actually just the right amount of sugar. Another favorite was the espresso donut, even though I'm not a big fan of the cake kind. We brought the box back to my in-laws house, and everyone was raving about the donuts. 

Fast forward to today-- My husband, son, and I had a hankering for donuts and braved the early Sunday morning drive to downtown. We got to the donut bar just a couple minutes shy of 8am and there was already a long line outside the door, waiting for the store to open. When 8am rolled around, the chef (?) opened the door and gleefully greeted the people waiting in line, and then proceeded to usher everyone in. We could smell the freshly made donuts before even stepping foot inside the store, which only fueled our hunger more. Upon stepping inside, it was such a different experience from when we went during Mother's Day. The cases were full of different flavored donuts, both fried and cake donuts alike. I truly felt like a kid in a candy store! The girl behind the counter offered our son a free inside-out themed donut, which I thought was really thoughtful-- they really cater to their customers at this place! Anyways, it was so hard for me to order since I wanted to try everything!!!! But we settled on the French toast donut (which was made to order ), a creme brûlée donut (obviously a crowd favorite), a Samoa, and a chocolate euphoria for my son. The French toast donut was good, different, and well worth a try. The cup of stumptown coffee they serve there went great with the donut. The Samoa was pretty good but, as I'm not a big fan of cake donut (my hubby is), I think I can pass on that next time. My son enjoyed his chocolate euphoria, and started picking on the chocolate shavings as soon as the donut arrived. Last but not the least, the star among the donuts we chose, the creme brûlée donut. It was quite small, but for only 2 bucks, it was a steal! My hubby did say that the caramelized sugar on top was a bit thick, but we both agreed that the donut was great and surprisingly not as sweet as we thought it would be. The creme brûlée filling was smooth and velvety, just how it should be, and accompanied the donut very well. I would honestly come back here just for another one of that donut, but I would be lying if I didn't say I want to try more. I might just have to make it mandatory that we go here every Sunday so we could try out a different donut each time. The strawberry shortcake donut they had looked mighty good, as well as the s'mores donut... I'm drooling just thinking about it XD

Although there are plenty other donut shops close to our house, the drive to downtown just to go to donut bar is well worth it. Not only are their donuts great, but all the associates we've had the chance to encounter were all so sweet, helpful, and personable. No wonder people keep flocking this place. Customer service is obviously a priority on their list, and there is nothing better than that... Aside from the donuts, of course lol. Donut bar, you have just gained new loyal customers who will try to frequent your place every Sunday :)",Restaurant
B50CchaGqjaK9umH9hqECA,4B6g0QiOUZu8urqkYbC_dA,bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA,2017-06-21,"How is the food at Coastal Taco? I am not able to answer that because, after several hours of being at my table, my food never arrived. It is a good thing that the atmosphere and the views are so enamoring, as unfortunately, this place must use that as a crutch or an excuse to provide absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced in my life. I am truly not exaggerating. I have never been to more poorly run establishment in my 37 years on the planet. It was honestly an almost laughable experience in how incredibly and unbelievably bad it was.

My friends and I asked for a table for 10 and arrived at 5:00 pm on a Tuesday. This was a birthday dinner and we decided to try this place again even after everyone had prior bad experiences here. We sat at the bar and had drinks while we waited for the table. At around 6:30, we were finally seated at two separate tables, four-tops, that while next to each other were far away from each other and crowded. We had watched many people come and go while we were waiting for tables and they admitted that they forgot to get our larger table ready. So we waited again for the people next to one of the tables left and moved the other group closer. We ordered our apps of chips, salsa and queso and after waiting a disproportionately long time for these to come out, they brought them out in shifts. One order of chips came, then 15 minutes later someone's queso came, then 15 minutes after that, another queso came. This was only the beginning...

Our orders then came in shifts, too. The first shift came and had maybe 4 of 10 of the orders. Then, nothing else came for about an hour. Then, a few more orders came. At that point three of us had still not gotten our food. It was after 8:00 pm at this point and several of our party had to get home to their kids by 9:00, so we asked for our bills. They then brought one more meal out, so ultimately two of us never got our food. I was one of them, so I asked for another margarita, which BTW was tiny and pretty sure had no booze whatsoever included in it. One of my friends had now gone to a manager two times at this point and they said they would take the food we didn't receive off the bill and discount our bills. We sat and waited for the checks and the margaritas for 30 minutes. Not even joking. Every time we saw the defensive and unapologetic server and asked for the drinks she just kept saying that the bartender was making them. When we asked where the checks were, she said she was at the bar waiting for our drinks so she didn't get the checks. I mean, this went on for 30 minutes. 

At the end, I think we received a 40% discount off our checks. If I would have had to pay full price at this place for the watered down, tiny margs and to starve, I would have been extremely unhappy. I do want to note that we were all very nice about all of this, and no one really got upset or acted annoyed until the very end when we absolutely could not take it anymore. This was a planned birthday dinner for my best friend - we are all moms and dads and it is not easy to get out together anymore now that we are old. This terrible service and not even eating here could have ruined a good night out, but thankfully, we salvaged the night and went next door to Beerhead and got a pizza, which was quite good.

If you are going to Coastal Taco, I recommend drinking beer (you at least know what you are getting) and sitting out on the patio\/deck for the views and the atmosphere. It is a shame that the service and the drinks and from what I was told, the food, was so incredibly lacking because this place really takes up some prime real estate and I would go here all the time in the summer for the venue. Sadly, I will not, nor will any of my friends, ever risk wasting our limited time out to ever patronize this place again.",Restaurant

The best way to explain an apple store atmosphere is it's always like the day before Christmas in a mall located Department Store. Regardless if a new product has been released or not, it's Chaotic, Loud, has Limited Seating and a Struggle to get service.

Note, my most recent visit was not during a New Product Release or Champaign. (Early September)

SERVICE, OR LACK OF; It was exhausting trying to find someone to check me in since the congestion caused the employees to blend in with the masses. If it's not a check in rep, then their useless.  I asked several employees where someone was that I could check in and was told multiple times  ""Their around here somewhere"".  

Making an appointment never fails to be completely useless.  I made one but it took almost 45 minutes after checking in and flagging down multiple CSR's -who were standing around doing nothing other that having personal conversations- to assure I'd eventually be helped. Meanwhile I saw other customers that arrived after me receive service first.

SEATING NOT ACCESSIBLE: After finally finding a check in, I was told to walk towards the back long table and have a seat.  I could not see any open spots so I asked if I could sit somewhere with an open spot.
I was told ""Sure, find a seat"".  
Excuse me? 
Find one?

For more reasons than just being handicapped, I find that direction unacceptable. 

It is hard enough to walk in crowded stores, but having to search for seating to only see one and someone hops in it seconds before you is both aggravating and exhausting.  I decided to instead ask the CSR to find me a seat and walk me over to it, as that was the only way I could be certain I'd find and receive an open one. They were very reluctant to do so but I insisted. 

They only have high hard stools that are not only uncomfortable and impractical, but also very unsafe since your constantly getting bumped into.   To top it off, that is 4 stools to a small square table that must be shared, so really only 2 people can have limited space and the rest must have their hands in their lap? 

It's great that they have plugs at those tables but only if you bring your charger. I would have figured that already owning an apple devise warranted the convenience of having the charging adapter waiting but I guess apple really doesn't care about service after sales? 

After flagging down several reps to ask how much longer I'd be waiting, and seeing people that came in after me being helped instead, an employee that had been standing aside occasionally looking my way decided to finally come over and asked if I had been helped.  
Not so fast- that doesn't mean she helped me. Instead she said she'd find someone to be right with me.  When someone did arrive, I described my issue and began getting an exchange covered by my apple care. Since my phone was almost dead (because most the power was used trying to locate the store) I had to rush after my sim was put in the new phone, to get home to a charger!  I could not even open and use it because the phone replacement they gave me was just as dead as mine was!  
Not once was I offered to charge my old phone or its replacement, which if I had known I was receiving a glitched phone I would have demanded one because my iCloud and back ups never transferred my pictures. 

Finally, locating this store was just as aggravating as locating a seat within the store.  The GPS kept me going in circles with my car on the BLVD, the parking lots and while on foot. It was like a maze since it wanted me to go threw a building that did not have customer access, but also warned if I did find a way in I might loose reception.   I ended up having to park incredibly far away and walking around several twists and turns of sidewalks.  When I arrived my GPS didn't even register I was there, it said I still needed to go around the back.  It just doesn't make sense. 

Overall- I would say this experience (except for locating the store) is pretty typical.  I prefer to go to the location within the Fashion Show Mall and will at all costs avoid this location from here on out.  
The service and accessibility trouble will be the same but at least I'll be able to find it with ease.",Shopping

The hotel is set in 55 acres of land and is 20 minutes drive away from the city centre. You arrive at the hotel by driving up a long driveway, to reach the main reception and house. 

The check in was efficient and we were asked whether we wanted an early wake up call, newspapers etc.

We asked about where the spa was located and due to proximity of our room, it was quicker to go out the main door and around the corner - a short 5 minute walk to the separate spa building. 

Our room was modern in decoration and had an interconnecting door to the room next door. Unfortunately the walls were a bit thin for our liking and we could hear our neighbours quite clearly through the bedroom walls! So we asked to move to a different room. The receptionist immediately moved us and a hotel staff member came to help us with our bags. Our new room close by to reception was a lot quieter and traditionally decorated. 

The spa facilities were great. A large pool and jacuzzi, sauna and steam room and a variety of shower settings that created different experiences - monsoon shower anyone? The changing facilities were facilitated well with showers (although the water was cool) toilets, drying machine for wet swimming kit, and lockers that required a four digit code so no pound coins required! 

There is also a spa cafe where people were enjoying afternoon tea as part of their spa package and there are two fitness studios and then the spa area for all those relaxing treatments. 

We dined in the hotel brasserie for one of our nights stay, and were not disappointed by the food. I chose the vegetarian option of butternut squash and mushroom risotto and my partner chose the burger and chips. The chips were some of the best chips I have tasted! The waiter staff were attentive and really looked after us well - I was impressed. The hotel also has another more up market restaurant - ushers restaurant but this was closed over the festive period. I had a sneaky look at the menu and prices for main meals were typically around the £15 mark upwards. 

There is a small bar area situated directly outside the brasserie with high back chairs and tables and a couple of sofas. A nice area for a pre dinner drink or afternoon hot chocolate - I did both!

Bear in mind the location of the hotel when booking as it is 20 minute drive away into the city centre but the location was perfect for work purposes. Taxi costs can vary but typically cost about £22 one way. 

Breakfast is served in the brasserie from 7am onwards and the choice is impressive. Breakfast is £15 per person for non residents or if breakfast is not included within your room rate. 

You can choose to have a cooked breakfast - eggs, sausages, bacon, beans, black pudding, and haggis are on offer. Being a lover of hash browns I asked whether it was possible to get some, but unfortunately the kitchen didn't have any. You can ask the kitchen to cook you other breakfast options such as bacon rolls, boiled eggs and soldiers and pancakes. 

There is another station with fruit, yoghurt, cereals and fruit. I was impressed by the variety on offer and the choice of beverages - fruit juices, coffee and a variety of teas.

qB3GvhERCRWTFkNcqj8YRw,-spmPJFUqSsbTBM-MzD9Ag,UhEhLSJrPRoiYWdHfJQxfw,2013-12-04,"I have never really sought to have very stylish hair. I have straight, medium bodied, brown, white-guy hair with a mean cowlick at the part and a thinning double crown. As you can imagine, there isn't a whole lot you can do with a head of hair like that. 

I've been around. I've been to chains and colleges, old-timer barber shops with 30 year clients, and classy barber shops with the bourbon, mahogany and hot shaves. I've been to trendy, organic and alt chic salons. Through it all, I walk out with a typical guy cut -- longer on top with a fade on the sides. Sure, I'm open to suggestion as well as whimsey. And while it does change a bit in length and style,  its always pretty standard. The results of these grooming adventures have varied from ""holy shit, get the trimmer"" to ""hey there handsome, what's your name? *mirror wink*"" But never in all my years of hair-taming have I said, ""damn... this is the best haircut I've ever had."" until going to Ro5.  

Now then, my stylist Noah is a nice guy. He's professional. I'm treated like a valued customer. He massages my scalp during the wash, carries a good conversation,  invites me to come in for a free cleanup every couple weeks and offers me free Lola coffee. Those things are great, and appreciated, but not unexpected at a price point of $35 (though SMS or email appointment reminders would be nice!). While those things are not unique to Ro5, the reason that I have had multiple best haircuts here (yes, some men can achieve ""multiple best haircuts"") comes down to a few special ingredients.

1.  Noah does not just give me a hair cut, he creates something unique to me that turns the various idiosyncrasies of my hair and scalp into strengths and features of the style. For example, he leaves the hair longer in the back to compensate for a steep decline toward my neck and blends it so that its not noticeable but still manages to improve the perception of my head shape. He uses the direction in which the hair grows in different areas to inform a more manageable style. My cowlick has been turned into a shelf that holds the style in place and traditional symmetry can be abandoned in order to balance the overall look with my face and head shape (no I do not look like the guy from the Goonies). 

2.  Great communication. If I come in with an idea of what I want, he won't just go for it, he will talk me through it.  Give me comments on what components of the concept will work with my hair and head.  He will show me different options and let me choose.  And if we have spent 30 or 40 minutes on one particular style and I or he isn't happy with it at the end, he will go back to the drawing board and send me home with something that works.  Sure, its expected that he respect when I feel like it is done and looks fine, but at the same time, he won't bullshit me if I ask for his opinion.  

3.  It ages well. I'm not really sure if this is a result of #1 or something that he considers while he is cutting, but I've never had hair cuts that look so good while they are growing in before.  Traditional awkward phases and funky spots that I have come to expect are somehow circumnavigated and I'm able to keep a coiffure that looks styled with minimal effort throughout the 5 or 6 weeks I usually take to get back in there. 

I should probably say at this point that I do not work at or with Ro5 and I am not friends with anyone who works there, outside of the banter I have with Noah while I'm getting my hair cut. I only went in the first place on account of the close proximity to my home and the positive yelp reviews. I simply wanted to give credit where credit is due. 

And thus, I highly recommend Ro5. Try it out for a few sessions and see if it works for you.",Shopping

I hadn't been to a World Market for years, but made a quick side trip in search of just one thing---among the probably ten thousand or more offered:  ginger snaps in a blue tin.  A friend of my husband's claimed that these were ""the best"".  He couldn't remember the name---only that it was a blue container.  Always on the hunt for the ""best of"" ANYTHING, World Market was added to my Marc's and Bed Bath & Beyond shopping list.  

Just an hour earlier I'd made a doctor's visit for serious ankle swelling.  While doing yardwork, I was bitten---or stung---by something hiding in the shrubs.  This was not your typical garden-variety bug, either.  Not mosquito, ant, spider, or even yellow jacket.  I've had those---those were nothing compared to THIS.  Like being jabbed with a long hypodermic needle (think Pulp Fiction) I actually screamed and yelped out loud ""THAT WAS A FIVE STAR STING!...But I DON'T recommend it.  At ALL!""  Instantaneous excruciating pain, followed soon after by numbness and redness, this might have been a starving vampire bat or rabid sewer rat---maybe even a rattlesnake.  (Not.)  Heating pad and antibiotics prescribed.  But when on a momentous hunt for---of all things---cookies (???), diehard curious food-trekkers will ignore any discomfort, and proceed onward.  To do otherwise would be weak, cowardly.  I was about to embark on another quest for the best---the legendary, rare, one-of-a-kind, Blue-Tinned Ginger Snap.  

With only a short time to squeeze World Market into an already very busy Saturday afternoon---much like that feeling of the tour bus scheduled to depart in just 15 minutes and if I missed it---here, in the middle of a desert, and no one speaks English---I'd never be heard from again (many, I'm sure, can identify with that stomach-fluttering sensation)---I avoided all tempting furnishings, alluring cookware, and mass-produced original art.  Like speed-reading---but thoroughly, comprehensively---I scanned only the shelves of FOOD ITEMS, and still managed to drop into my cart, Spanish smoked paprika, Swedish flax seed and hearty crispbreads from WASA (also at GE, but these were on sale), and their own brand of potato chips made in an unspecified location, but somewhere in the USA.  Not bad.  And not imported from Pago Pago or Easter Island.  I also sampled a few food items on display for tasting (all good enough, but nothing I couldn't live without) and spotted a shelf of Pocky's---that irresistible Asian sweet treat---in about 4 varieties.  But after what was now maybe 10 unsuccessful minutes, and believing I had covered the entire food area---I could see that my hopes of ever finding the elusive---almost mythical
---snaps, were nearing the dashed level.   Were they sold out?  Worse!---what if they didn't carry these ""best"" ever, anymore?

Reluctantly---because I'm pretty resourceful---I relented and asked Kevin for help.  He was a friendly, knowledgeable guide, even offering to, then quickly scaling a high wall of unopened cartons, but without luck.  He then enlisted the assistance of the official ""gourmet girl"".  Didn't get her name, but she was friendly and helpful, too, and led Kevin and me through the overstocked jungle of edible imports to the very edge.  And there it was---ahead, in a clearing---a small mountain of bright shiny Blue Tins.  NYAKERS PEPPARKAKO.  Seriously---how could ANYONE not remember that name.  hehe.  Shipped here from Sweden, 1.10 lbs. each, and $7.99 on sale for only $4.99.   Many many sincere thanks, then rushing off to the checkout---and ANOTHER smiling, friendly employee.  Yeesh.  It's TOO nice in here.  (Loved it.  You will, too.  Unless you're one of those cuddly negative types.)   

Started the car and was about to pull out when I decided to have my OWN taste sampling.  Got out my pocket knife (yes) and cut the plastic seal around the can.  Thin, 2 inch wide wafers packed like sardines. (Less likely to break.  Those 
ever-sensible, ever-efficient Swedes.)  The first one---gingery, slightly peppery
---small bites, like those initial slow deliberate sips of a newly-tried, expensive fine wine.   The second, quicker, with more eagerness and savoring, but less thought.   Then the third---just to confirm it's deliciousness---but no little bites now, just the whole thing shoved right in.   mm-mm-mm.

Pulled the key out of the ignition, and a couple minutes later returned to my car with two more tins.  I'll be back.  If I'm THIS lucky in less than half an hour, who knows WHAT I might discover in one or two.",Shopping

I married a Southern boy, so as I was reading the online menu to him, he decided he really wanted to go. Unfortunately for Lucille's, we've already been to Bobby Q's and Lucille's just does not stack up.

DRINKS: Hubby had an interesting dark beer made by Albita Ale in Louisiana (although our server mistakenly said it was from Mississippi) called Turbo Dog which had some rich coffee tones. I am not usually a dark beer drinker, but I liked it too. I had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint. It was sweet, but not LoLo's sweet (God love ya' LoLo's, but you're not exactly helping prevent the diabetes!) and that's a good thing. 

APPETIZERS: Hubby just had to have him some fried okra. I tried two pieces to be a good sport, but the interior texture is something I just can't get over. He thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch. We were also served some biscuits (which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher) and some ""apple butter"" which was not really apple butter, but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon. Not impressive.

MEAT: Hubby had the brisket and I had the tri-tip. The brisket is so far superior at Bobby Q's in terms of tenderness. Lucille's wasn't awful, though, and the ""mop sauce"" which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table (original, Memphis, and Hot & Spicy) was really good, and I usually don't like BBQ sauces. My tri-tip was very smoky in flavor, but rather dry. I asked for it dry (meaning no sauce) and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the true test of good BBQ was having it sauce-less. And so I did. And Lucille's did not pass the test on the tri-tip.

SIDES: Hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious, and also the peanut slaw, which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil. It also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it, which made it inedible for me, but Hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he'd ever had.  I had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn was delicious, but I had no idea it would be on the cob. At Bobby Q's, they roast it, slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl, which I prefer. The mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve Southern food. I am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it. I have had better from a Kraft Deluxe box.

DESSERT: I am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the true standout. I have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can, so the homemade version at Lucille's was a treat. It had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving (more than enough for 2). It was topped with real whipped cream (not Redi-Whip).

SERVICE: The service was quite good, attentive but not annoying. A manager stopped by our table toward the end, and Hubby made a comparison between Lucille's and Bobby Q's. The manager said that a few other managers had come over from Bobby's to Lucille's, and implied that something was amiss at Bobby's in the overall running of the place. Whatever that is, it is not overt, as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby's. We decided that we'll give Lucille's 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs, and we'll return to try again. In the meantime, you'll see us at Bobby's.",Restaurant

We ate a lot. So prepare yourself for a comprehensive review. ;)

Went to Vegas this past weekend with friends and had the chance to visit Serendipity's on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  We caught the restaurant during the soft opening, and had a great experience!

If you are walking off the strip along LV Boulevard and up the stairs into the restaurant you are greeted by a host podium in the shape of a woman's bust! They weren't swamped, so you leave your name with the host in the merchandise corner inside the restaurant and get a buzzer.

The Vegas location indoors is expansive compared to the NY location, with patio seating wrapping around the restaurant, as well as a To-Go window.  (More space here meant no stranger's elbow in your side or waiter's tray nicking you in the head here!!!) Unlike NY, the only doo-dads and randoms the LV location sells are Serendipity-branded merchandise, as well as a few sweets.  

The staff manages to utilize small space well, as seen in the bar and the open kitchen.  The bar is colorful and entertaining, with wispy cotton candy filling glass jars for the signature Cotton Candy martinis, and their ever-so popular Frrrozen Hot Chocolates lining up on the counters ready to be served. 

Our wait was 20-30 minutes, during which my friends ordered a couple drinks, two of which names I can't remember, but they were yummy. While they worked on their buzz we hung out in the large courtyard outside overlooking fountains and (at least for this particular weekend) a Thai shrine.

Our waiter was Allen, and he was able to deal with the 6 of us while remaining playful yet attentive.  AMAZING guy!  We were seated outdoors with a view of the strip with the traffic and the throngs of drunks and tourists! If its a nice day out, I would definitely choose to sit outdoors!  Another friend ordered another drink, a mojito-like one with cranberries, and it was WAY too sour for my taste.

The menu looked similar New Yorks, HOWEVER there were menu items that were made specially for the Las Vegas location. We ended up ordering:

Popcorn & Shrimp
Popcorn shrimp served with popcorn! :) My friend squeezed lemon all over this and we had our choices of creamy sauces on the side.  The shrimp was delicious, the batter not being too heavy or cloying.  

Breakfast Steak Sandwich
Get this if you're hungover. A New York steak cooked to order was topped with 4-5 eggs, all piled on a 12 inch crunchy baguette.  The baguette is as crunchy as a Lee's Sandwiches' Banh Mi.  With that said, there's a chance its crunchy enough to cut the roof of your mouth ;) Other than the fact that she wished she ordered the steak cooked medium, she was happy with it. Runny yolks over meat and crispy bread? Rawr.

The Rachel Sandwich
I opted for the Sweet Potato Fries with this order.  The fries were meh, I'd try the chips next time or stick with waffle fries.  Although I'm not much of a fan of coleslaw, a newbie to pastrami, and not a fan of raisins, this sandwich was AMAZING.  The Rachel sandwich is the female counterpart to the Reuben; a rich hefty portion of well-seasoned pastrami piled on with a crunchy, flavorful bed of coleslaw, all sandwiched on dark raisin bread.  The whole thing was then thrown onto a grill, for a crisp finish. Needless to say, I shared, but I pretty much ate the whole thing.

Pizza
Didn't taste this, but heard no complaints. Flat bread pizza, served on a paddle. Standard sauce and cheese topped with mushrooms.

Mac and Cheese
F*ing delish. Creamy and not-overly salty like many restaurants.  Noodles cooked to a great consistency with a killer combination of cheeses.

Deep Fried Oreos & Ice Cream
My friend ordered this for his entree and it was delicious and rich- the classier version of county fair food ;) Served in a large parfait glass on a plate to catch the melting ice cream and overflowing chocolate sauce. The consistency of the whipped cream was something we couldn't get over.  It was thick and wouldn't melt like standard whipped cream, yet was still SO airy and light.  Must've been made fresh. The oreos themselves were fried correctly, and was abundant in the dessert, with my friend finding another one or two in hiding.

ABC Burger
This was the Avocado, Brie, and Caramelized Onions burger, served with standard burger toppings on the side.  Magical freakin combination!  My friend ordered this with waffle fries which were perfectly crispy and fresh. 

Frrrozen Hot Chocolate
One of those things you just kind of have to get once. Delish.

All this with various sodas and waters, which were constantly refilled. Allen was able to split our checks, told you he was amazing!

We breezed right in to our reservation with no problems and the waiters made us feel comfortable right away. I liked the feel of the place right away, too, with the high beamed ceilings, big open glass doors and cute, stylish touches scattered about. 

The cocktail menu looked to die for but I was in a beer frame of mind so I went with their peach beer, which I loved, because it reminded me of Pyramid Apricot Ale, which is one of my East Bay faves. The others got some amazing looking concoctions, though, so if I ever get back here I'll be sure to get a cocktail. I was really impressed because one of my dining companions couldn't decide what beer she wanted so asked if they could serve her a flight, and they were happy to oblige (I'm not sure how she ended up getting charged for that, but the effort was still nice). 

We got a bunch of appetizers to share. The mac and cheese is not as heavy and gooey as a lot of 'fancy' mac and cheeses that I've had, and I could not stop eating it. We also had some enchiladas with shrimp and sweet corn that was amazing. And of course, I couldn't resist the brussels sprouts - I can never resist brussels sprouts. I liked that they had shaved manchego on them but I have to say I've had better cooked and more flavorful brussels sprouts in my life. I think my least favorite app was the roasted veggie because it was a bit flavorless compared to everything else, and people didn't seem too enthused about the matzo ball soup either. 

For my entree, I shared half of the salmon dish and half of the short rib with my neighbor. They've recently re-done the salmon dish, so it's different from the way it's described on the menu. The waiter had a really quiet voice so I had to have him repeat it to me a couple of times, but basically now they grill the salmon with salt and pepper and serve it with brussels petals and cornbread panzanella, cucmbers and some sort of yummy vinaigrette. I loved it! I love my salmon super rare so I wish they had asked me how I wanted it, but everyone else was perfectly fine with it. The short rib was very good as well - we replaced the mashed potatoes with more roasted veggies, but it also comes with string beans, one of my other favorite veggies. 

The desserts were vast and impressive. Despite my loud, showy protests, I couldn't help digging my spoon into the gourmet s'mores dish, with its caramelized marshmallow and chocolate covered bacon, the creme brulee (standard but good), and my favorite, the sweet potato pie. My least favorite was the blueberry crumble, which surprised me because I was positive that it would be my favorite. 

I'm no expert in Scottsdale culture, but I have a feeling that this little hotspot in a strip mall may be a major player in the local cuisine - its fresh, classic dishes and friendly service are definite crowd pleasers!",Restaurant

BUT BE WARNED!
If you are ordering a wedding dress or bridesmaids dress be ready for some trouble.

I have read some pretty awful reviews, but I figured they can't screw up EVERY order right?? WRONG!

I am planning my wedding for August 2016, but started shopping September 2015 because my bridesmaids and I would be out of country a lot during the next year. Lets begin, my bridesmaids and I went on 2 or 3 different occasions, and we have ALWAYS witnessed meltdowns, arguments, dissatisfied brides\/customers, and the manager trying to solve some sort of crises\/mistake. Of course, not everything could run smoothly all the time, especially in the wedding industry but that was already a scary sign.

Nevertheless, my bridesmaids and I found a beautiful one shoulder lace and tulle dress that flattered all my girls (Sizes 0, 8 and 12). We went ahead and ordered the three (ONLY 3!) dresses this was in September 2015 and were told the dresses would arrive by Christmas time or early January 2016. Sounded okay to me since my wedding was in August 2016. 

By November, my size 8 bridesmaid received a call that her dress was ready for pick up, the next day, we went to David's Bridal. She tried on the dress and the lace was completely ruined. It had loads of white thread (on a navy blue dress) exposed on both the front and back of the dress. We notified an associate and they proceeded to order a new one. 

My other bridesmaid received a call at the end of January stating her dress was ready for pick up, she went in within the next couple of days and realized they ordered her the WRONG size, 3 sizes too small, even though her receipt and bridal profile clearly stated she ordered a size 12. So again, that order was reordered.  

Keep in mind, we ordered September 9th and were promised the dresses would arrive by Christmastime or early in the New Year. It's February at this point... and we still didn't even hear about our size 0 dress...

At the start of February, I called David's Bridal to check on the progress of the dresses, the size 8 and 12 was reordered but still didn't hear back about my size 0.  The customer service representative notified me that 2 out of my 4 (only ordered 3 dresses!) were already picked up. I let her know that firstly, I only ordered 3 dresses and secondly NONE of the dresses were picked up.  She said yes they were, I said no they weren't. We went back and forth like this for a couple of minutes until she magically realized I was right and there were in fact only 3 dresses ordered and that NONE were picked up. She then told me the date they would come by would be April 23. APRIL 23rd!!!!!! For a dress I ordered in EARLY SEPTEMBER! When I expressed my anger\/confusion, she then had the NERVE to say ""Your wedding is in August anyway, what does it matter? The dresses will be here end of April."" I was all sorts of emotions at this point; angry, confused, irritated, overwhelmed but mostly WORRIED. 

A week after that phone call, in February 2016 we got our second call that her dress was ready for pick up. Once we arrived we gave the associate our receipt and she imputed the information on the computer and said the dress was already picked up. I thought to myself here we go again, I spent 20 minutes on the phone with the customer service representative convincing her that it was NOT picked up, and how could it have been if we needed either the original receipt of purchase or I.D. 

Finally after some searching in their files, they said it was in fact there. She went to the back to get her dress, but came back empty handed. She notified us the dress was ""missing"" and began to seek assistance from the manager. 

The manager was busy with another displeased bride whose dress was ordered in the wrong size. We also overheard her complain about her consultant who didn't even help her put on the wedding dresses in the fitting rooms. 

After 30 minutes of waiting, the manager finally came to help us. There was not much to do at this point; she seemed just as lost and confused as to what the hell has been happening. She gave us very little options going forward. I suggested if she couldn't guarantee arrival of the dresses by the end of March, then a refund was my only option.  She could not guarantee the arrival date, but was nice about it, apologized and preceded with the refund.

Overall, dealing with David's Bridal has been an absolute nightmare. Everything that could go wrong did, from missing dresses to ruined dresses to wrong sized dresses. I would never deal with David's Bridal again, and I highly highly highly recommend brides and bridesmaids to AVOID this place as it will be super stressful and disappointing. I did however love the dresses they have. Now its back to square one, shopping AGAIN for bridesmaids,, praying it will be a more pleasant and stress FREE!",Shopping

Ladies you will understand my Thanksgiving clothing dilemma.  You wake up on Thursday morning, grab the sale flyers, plan your Black Friday attack and then gorge on a great Thanksgiving meal.  On Black Friday you are supposed to take your now full belly that is sticking out from all of the great carbs that you devoured the night before and try on clothes that now don't fit because you got lazy over the holidays and chose eating a holiday cookie with sprinkles over going to Zumba class.
Luckily Black Friday has now become Turkey Thursday.  A good chunk of the sales started on Thursday morning instead of Friday at midnight. We can now buy our clothes before the 5,000 calorie turkey day meal.  Old Navy decided that instead of lounging around and planning my shopping attack I was to throw on whatever fit, hop in the car and go lay claim to some $15 skinny jeans.  Yes, that right, the Old Navy skinny jeans that just make your ass look oh so good were on sale for $15.
I called first to verify that the jeans were on sale for $15 with no strange strings attached to the purchase price and that my size was still available.  The woman that I spoke to was a manager.  She did a shelf check for me and verified that yes, the sale had no fine print and that my size was still on the shelf.
So here I go to Old Navy, hair in a pony tail of death, big football t shirt left over from an ex, when I should be getting ready for a half day of work and baking my contribution to friends pot luck Thanksgiving Day dinner.
The parking lot was full.  I got the last space at the end of the lot, grabbed my keys and headed toward the door.  Between me and the door was a perfume squirter.

Bad timing..

 Very very bad timing...

One of those perfume squirters was stopping people in the parking lot. She is a woman, does she not understand that stopping people from time sensitive shopping deals is a bad idea?  She almost got run over by a truck before she approached me and tried to squirt me with a free sample of whatever the hell perfume she was trying to sell.  I firmly said no and brushed past her.  I don't have time for this.  $15 skinny jeans await.

I walk into the store and it was mobbed.  A sales clerk handed me some 3-D glasses and a coupon.  The coupon was for 10% off of a $100 purchase.  I never figured out how to use the 3-D glasses.
I walk back to where Old Navy stacks the skinny jeans.  Surprisingly the section was not disheveled.  I searched for my jeans and didn't see them in the right length.  I asked a sales woman if there were more in the back.  She said that there were alot more and went in the back and grabbed me a few pairs.
I went right into the dressing room.  I really don't know why there wasn't a wait for the rooms with the mob that was shopping but I went right in.  
Damn my ass looks good in these jeans!  All of the extra workouts over the past year were worth it.  Two spins in the mirror and then back into my own clothes.
I looked around and never did find the table with the $5 t-shirts but now time is of the essence. I have to get back to Thanksgiving day reality and bake my secret recipe Alfredo dish before heading in for my half day of work.  I must now navigate around the unsupervised toddlers and teenage girls bickering with mom about how tight jeans should be and get into the long line of of people who are in just as much of a rush as I am to check out and move on.
The line was about 30 deep but they had six checkers working and it took about 10 minutes for it to be my turn. The jeans rang up at the $15 sale price and I grabbed my bag and headed toward the door.
4 Stars on a hectic day!  They had my jeans, they rang up correctly, the crowd was handled quickly and my ass looks great.  Star is lost because after rounding the store and following staff directions I never did find the $5 T-shirts.",Shopping
9VRhAdi4wDk8I5BsJV_kfg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg,2009-03-02,"I heard about this great restaurant, serving Rustic French Country cuisine, by a good friend of mine. He raved about how wonderful Metro Brasserie was and knowing him and his tastes, he usually isn't too far off the mark. So when I had the opportunity to pick a place for my girlfriends and I to meet, I thought what a perfect place to check out. Metro Brasserie is located in Old Town Scottsdale near the chic Waterfront.  The Waterfront is surrounded by trendy boutiques, cafes and wine bars and it's a bustle with Phoenician hipsters and tourists alike. We were all really excited to try this hip new place and feeling our stomachs grumble couldn't wait to indulge our taste buds in yummy delights. It was a little bit busy, after all it was a sunny Sunday afternoon, during the busiest time of the day. We were told the wait would be around 40 minutes for the patio and 20 minutes for interior sitting. Without hesitation we decided interior seating would be best...did I mention we were all really hungry? Within 15 minutes the hostess seated us. The restaurant was super cute and reminded me of some of the little french cafes at home, back in Canada. Thoughts of Pomme Frites, Poutine and Croque Monsieur danced through my head.

The menu had a pretty nice variety of entrees on it and you could order either breakfast or lunch. I really like when restaurants give you options. By the way, who doesn't like a good breakfast?? That's a whole other conversation. Anyway, back to Metro Brasserie - the waiter came to take our order, my friend couldn't decide between the French Toast and the Quiche. Who better to ask then the waiter! My friend proceeds to tell the waiter she's torn between two items.""French Toast or Quiche? Which is better?"" Seemed like a pretty normal kind of question for a waiter. His response blew us away. ""Well, they're really different. One is sweet and the other savory."" The table is silent and I'm sure we're all thinking the exact same thing...no shit! It was at that moment our excitement was replaced with disappointment and a hint of irritation. Not only was the waiters personality drier than toast but let's just say he was seriously lacking character and manners. We all put in our orders; a Burger for me, Belgian Endive Salad with chicken for my friend and the Mushroom Brie Quiche for my other girlfriend. 

An hour and twenty five minutes went by and no food. Our waiter didn't stop by during that time at all - you think he would have advised us of a problem in the kitchen or even just apologized for the delay. Nothing! Our food finally arrives and we begin to devour what seems like a precious jem. The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare with Gruyere and the Pomme Frites and mayo were amazing. The Quiche on the other hand was just okay, ""nothing special"" and the Belgian Endive Salad with chicken was not the best. Apparently, the Salad was also nothing special and had a strange flavored dressing on it that was clearly not enjoyable. We finish eating and chatting and decide to call it day. Mr. poo poo waiter hadn't been by to check on us and after having had waited so long for a mediocre lunch we weren't terribly happy.
  
The service was blatantly awful, the waiter was rude, and only one dish was really good...what to do? Being the somewhat decent consumer, we decide to leave a 10% tip. Anything less would be pretty rude considering most of the food industry lives off the tips. I could not bring myself to leave this fine establishment without saying something, I wrote a little note on the receipt that said ""This is the worst service I've ever experienced!"" I really felt compelled to say something about our experience. We're in the middle of a recession and eating out is a privilege that should be enjoyed. So, shouldn't patrons be treated well when spending money in establishments?",Restaurant

Huh?

Well, you are on the strip (the north end by Circus Circus), but there is no Casino here, but there are 2 towers of 27+ stories, a concierge, pool, parking garage, marketplace deli, but no on site restaurants. So maybe this isn't your idea of Vegas. 

But if you come here for business, a family vacation, or to stay more than a 3 day girls' or boys' lost weekend in a drunken stupor, this place has a lot of pluses. 

Like no casino, and no restaurants.

Why is that a plus? 

You get tired of having to plan all your meals around a restaurant or room service. It gets expensive for an extended stay. Plus you don't want to wait in line constantly, get dressed to go out in public, or have to constantly tip valets, servers, cab drivers, etc. 

So you get a 1 bedroom suite here, which includes  full kitchen with toaster, mixer, microwave, oven, stove, full size fridge, pots, pans, plates, glasses, utensils, in unit washer\/dryer with complimentary detergent, dining table for 4, dishwasher with complimentary detergent, granite countertops, paper towels, liquid soap and sponge, living room with queen sofa bed, lounge chair and ottoman, dresser, desk\/vanity, 2 40 inch LCDTVs (one in each room), King size bed in the bedroom, with amoire and dresser, oversized jacuzzi bathtub, flagstone like bathroom with double entry ways (bedroom, living room), separate glass enclosed shower, large pool area, common pool\/ping pong table, activity room, larger than normal gym with machines and free weights, deli\/marketplace for casual meals and snack foods, valet or self parking, business center, and VIP lounge. Plus you get Hilton Honors points. 

I got this for $134\/night this trip. Bought some groceries for breakfast and lunch, even some for dinner, and chose when to go to a restaurant or a casino, but could always come back and relax. Free WiFi too, and I didn't have to endure any timeshare pitch. 

Actually, I like the set-up quite a bit. 

So I am in Vegas, without always having to be in Vegas.   

When you come here several times  a year, and you have long passed doing the crazy things like in the movies, this is a good choice. 

PS - they really tried to give good service, too. I received 4 different messages about various things, like a welcome packet, free water bottles as a gold Hilton member, when did I want to schedule housekeeping (because I had the do not disturb sign hanging nearly all day), and the concierge letting me know they can book shows and get discounts. 

The small downsides are that parking is not directly attached, it is about 100 yards away; check out is 10 am, and parking costs $8 self or $13 valet. 

I have stayed at the sister Hilton Grand Vacations on nearby Karen Avenue, too, and this one is bigger, nicer, newer, and better service.

This may not be in the exact heart of the strip, but there isn't a steady stream 10 deep of wide eyed-eyed riff raff holding long neck margaritas yelling and screaming outside your window and flashing pics of everything in site. The lot across the street is empty, but they are building another mega hotel next door. 

Enjoy it while you can.",Beauty

In contrast to the overpriced Royal Mile tourist restaurants offering, as a general rule, fairly low quality food, Civerinos is the real deal and very competitively priced. Civerino's is located just off the Royal Mile near the Tron Kirk in Hunter Square and serves a fanatastic selection of family recipes handed down through Michele's family, featuring Italian street food and of course Pizza by the slice or whole.

The beautiful glass door way opens into a minimalist style canteen with long tables and an open kitchen where the smell of food drifts tantalizingly from. The staff are super welcoming giving a real easy going family feel to the place. The owner Michele is often sat at the bar and came to talk to us about his plans for the restaurant, the food and his plans for the upcoming Festival season.

It is easy to see why the food at Civerino's food is so good when you meet Michele. His enthusiasm and passion for Italian food and the business is inspiring and infectious! He is so excited by the fresh produce, especially after a recent trip with the kitchen team to source new products and try out new ideas resulting in some fabulous new gorgonzola croquettes, Italian salamis and porcini mushroom sauce to mention a few of the tasty new treats. He certainly loves his food and takes pride in his family's heritage. Civerino's is an expression of this passion - great food from the heart; timeless, classic recipes using exceptional fresh ingredients that would last forever.

A long term Edinburgh resident and foodie Michele loves eating at many of the local establishments and is very complementary about many of his neighbours including fellow street food success Ting Thai Caravan where he loves to go for his dinner and Ninja buns, who are now providing the food at Paradise Palms.

With the restaurant's first festival season approaching fast they are keen to ensure they still manage to save some space for their regular followers and will be keeping a table at the back for bookings from those who have booked before. They will also be open late so you can head over after your shift or show too. Seating outside should help them to catch the eye of the passing traffic as will their new Gelato bike set to appear very soon!

On to the food - having tried the fabulous pizzas on a different occasion we decided to embark on trying out the rest of the menu. Mix and match home made pasta varieties and sauces featuring pig cheek carbonara and slow cooked beef ragu are sure to be a crowd pleaser and there are some really exciting antipasti dishes if you can draw your gaze away from the pizza menu that is.

We decided on the parsley and chilli calamari, beef meatballs in mushroom sugo, Steak tagliata with wild rocket salad and Zuccini fritti. The food is served on sharing style boards with individual paper plates, so you can get stuck in and help your self in unpretentious communal dining style. We were very impressed with all our dishes, light crispy battered zucchini was really tasty, well-cooked steak with roast tomatoes and rocket was the stuff of dreams believe me, and of course crispy calamari with aioli was just about perfect, but the rich tasty porcini sauce with the meatballs was a stand out winner at our table. We were dipping everything in it!

The wine and beers are all really well priced and they have a frozen cocktail too! Featuring popular Italian favorites including Negroni and Aperol Spritz. Desserts are also pretty awesome - we were recommended to try the Tiramisu but didn't have space after our feast so it will have to be saved for our next visit.

I am so pleased to have discovered this exciting gem of a restaurant right in the centre of all the festival action and cant wait to go back for more. Especially for their late night pizza and great music on until the early hours throughout the summer of Edinburgh's festivals, and the terrace set in Hunter Square where you can sit and watch the crazy world of the Royal Mile go by!",Restaurant

The lady who did my SNS manicure wasn't very talkative, but made sure to tell me that she was in a hurry because she had a client right after me. It literally took her about 15min to do my entire manicure. She did not push back my cuticles or clean around the nail, and she made every one of my nails crooked. She had also accidentally touched my nail too soon before it was dry and left smudge marks on a couple of my nails. When I was finished and sat down for my pedicure, she came by and gave me about a 20second massage leaving my arms so greasy afterwards that I had to ask someone to get me a wet washcloth to take it off. 

During my pedicure, I told the lady that I liked how long they were, I just wanted the square round shape. She ended up cutting off every single nail I had super short to the point where it was painful. When she was trying to get the previous gel off, she also knicked my skin really bad that it got infected! I was so upset that I just told her to quit doing my nails and that I was finished. I did not want gel on them or for her to finish because they were so short and were hurting. She could obviously tell I was super upset and still tried to make me pay $30 for her horrible service. When I got to the front, I instantly started crying the second the receptionist tried to ask how the service was. I was really upset how horrible my SNS manicure turned out and how fast she did it and how the second lady ruined my toes. I don't even want to get them done until they grow out and the infection goes down. You can see in the picture posted that it looks like a 12 year cut my nails for me and not a professional... The guy at the front was really understanding and ended up telling me to come and get my SNS manicure redone and told me not to worry about paying. I had every intention on paying for my manicure, but he told me it was taken care of and even ended up writing me a gift card for $65 which was really sweet.

I came back a couple days later for the touch up on my manicure just to fix the shape and clean them up. I did NOT expect them to redo the entire service. When I came in, the manager at the front seemed really confused and made me feel super uncomfortable for coming in but was sure to let me know right away that she did not see my payment from the other day. It was awkward having to explain to her that the guy told me not to worry about the service. They should have communicated with one another instead of making me feel uncomfortable and having to explain the situation. She seemed more worried about making sure I knew I had to pay for the service instead of apologizing for my bad experience. She did ask what had happened, but did not seem to care, but instead told me to give them the gift card the guy had written for me. I gave them the benefit of the doubt to make things right, and instead of apologizing for what had happened, they made it seem like I had no right to come in and get my nails fixed when it was obvious they were done poorly. The man at the front rudely told me to just pick out a color and I had to explain to him 3 times that I just wanted them fixed, not completely redone. The lady who touched up my nails was really nice and even agreed that my nails were not done properly the first time and that the lady who had done my nails previously always gets complaints for how fast she is. This lady had pushed back the cuticles and cut them, cleaned under and around my nail, and even had to make the shape even for me (took maybe 10min which was ok, because it was done right.) When I had walked back to the front, they had told me they comped the service because of the gift card I had. The SNS manicure is only $40, and my gifts card was written for $65. They didn't even bother to give me the other $25 for future use, they just kept the whole thing. I still did not get a single apology for the horrible service I had received few days prior. All they wanted was to make sure I paid them for the service which I was not opposed to at all, the guy just offered the free services and gift card, so I accepted it. I am way too uncomfortable to go back there anymore and super upset for how they treated me. I would never treat a guest the way that they treated me and am just disappointed in the way the managers handled the situation. I will not be returning here anymore...",Beauty
kM4vYIgYxEuSoGTA0YF8XQ,49SXsLMeH_Py2vC8F9ZHRg,54mFqsRyxH-ud7dX1zwejg,2013-02-20,"Really hard to choose a rating. I was very much between a 2 and 3. I found this place because my friend just moved to the area. I live in Pittsburgh, so it was a bit of a hike for me to schedule an appointment here. But for a good salon I am willing to make the trip. I scheduled my appointment for a Saturday 2 weeks in advance. I specifically went here because they were an Aveda salon and I had been to and liked other Aveda places in the past. They have a super organic feel that I keep wanting to revisit. There is brand loyalty at it's finest.

Upon arriving the staff was extremely friendly, offering me their list of services and something to drink. As I was taken upstairs to get my hair done, I was escorted by the girl who was going to do my hair. 

So I sit down and tell her what I want and the first thing she says is ""we don't have enough time to do a full highlight. Especially with how much hair you have. You'll have to come back to finish that"" This is the point in which I should have said, ""Okay, thanks anyways!"" and walked out. Come on! I am a new customer. If this was an issue for you, you should have asked me when I made my appointment 2 weeks back if I had long or thick hair. Amateur move, Vans. 

Now the whole visit I am basing what I have done on the time schedule they set. I felt rushed and as if I was taking up too much of her time. I hate feeling that way at a salon. I should feel relaxed at a place like this. And above all, I work a ton and definitely don't have time to make 2 trips to your salon for a service that should be done in a few hours. 

Second I was asked if I wanted my hair blow dried. I said ""if you have time"" because she clearly was busy as her phone is ringing to tell her the next customer is there. Hello! It's snowing outside! If you want to ask me this question in the heat of summer, by all means, go for it. When it's snowing outside, if your salon let's me walk out with wet hair, shame on you!

Third thing that sort of irked me. I was charged for a cut. But she cut my bangs and did a small amount of thinning of my hair. If you are going to charge me for a cut, take the time to trim up my hair, please! 

Overall, I left feeling like I paid $100 +tip for nothing. 
1.) I thought the color was too yellow. In some lights I look at my hair and think it looks like a box color that didn't quite sit long enough to highlight all the way. Perhaps she gets a lot of people in there and opts to go more conservative. ( Not one person noticed I had highlights put into my hair because it was so close to the color it was when I went in! And this was the first I had it done in 6 months! ) One thing I learned is I'll never hit up a salon without an example picture of what I want.
2.) I felt like I got a half a haircut and paid full price. I even had to specifically make her go back and do SOMETHING with the side swooping bangs I wanted. She put no layer or texture to them... just cut them with a hard edge. I went home and immediately cut them myself.

 This is probably a great salon for people who live in the area and need a simple service done. I just don't see myself returning. 

NOTE: I did tell them via email about my concerns. Got a call that day, which was awesome of them. The owners had the employee working call me. Props to the owners for that! 

Unfortunately the call I received was sort of an apology and it's also not our fault because you have lots of hair type of voicemail. It's already super uncomfortable to complain to a salon. It just made me feel guilty. I don't want to go in and sit with the same girl for an hour around a salon with employees who think I am just there complaining. Seems so... I dunno, embarrassing and awkward? I am also so swamped at work that I don't have time to go back in their hours in the next few weeks, so by then my ""window of fixing the problem"" will likely be closed. Overall just very :(",Shopping

I decided to look on groupon and Eli sabat salon popped up. I checked out the website and it seemed fine. I called to make an appointment and he said he can get me in that same day at 10 am. I was super excited! I told him I wanted the full head of highlights that the groupon offered. Eli told me not to get it on groupon, he would just give me the price when I got there; I thought nothing of it. I arrived at the salon and told my husband to wait before leaving because it didn't seem like a good looking place, and to me appearance is everything. I popped in and didn't think it looked bad, so I gave my husband the ok to leave. Eli was at the front desk texting on his phone not even paying attention to the person that had walked in. After me standing there for about 2 min he looked up, greeted me, and asked me what he can do for me. I told him I had an appointment with him at 10. He said, ""ok are you the one with the haircut appointment?"" I said, ""no, I had the groupon offer."" He told me they don't except the groupons on a Friday. I then informed him that I had recently called asking if I could use the groupon that same day and that the person (the same Eli) on the phone said it would be fine. He said, ""that's ok"" and proceeded to take me to a chair where he asked what I wanted and I told him I wanted a full head of highlights and I didn't want them to look very stripy; I wanted them to blend. He grabbed some foils really quick and mixed some bleach together and proceeded to dye my hair....anyone that's ever had a professional hair dye done knows that it doesn't take only ten minutes to complete, but apparently Eli thought it was good enough. It only took him ten minutes to bleach and foil my hair, while snapping at his assistant to get more bleach and foil. Five minutes into the bleaching, 3 ladies (clearly they had a close relationship with Eli) come in and start talking to Eli asking him to do their hair. Once Eli rapidly finished my hair, he left me with the foil in my hair covering my face while he started working on the other three women. It took about thirty minutes for him to notice how uncomfortable I was with my face being covered. So, he clipped my hair back and put a heater around my head, so that the bleach could start working. Eli left me in that chair for about an hour and a half..... and we all know that bleach is harmful when it's left in there that long. He came back to check on me and I could see him open the foil and noticed that a huge chunk of my hair had not been affected by the bleach at all... But Eli wrapped the foil back up and told me that I needed to wait thirty more minutes. By the time he finally took me to get the bleach washed out, he had finished with the 3 ladies that had come in, and was finishing up 2 others (that came in way after me). As he was shampooing my hair, he ripped a lot of my hair out. I kept informing him that it hurt my head, but that did not seem to make sense to him, because he just kept yanking my hair out. He left me sitting at the wash station with shampoo in my hair for another 15 minutes, while he finished up with the 4th lady that had come in after me. At this point I was fuming. I texted my husband to come back and get me, because I was ready to leave. I didn't feel like I was treated properly. While I was sitting, waiting for someone to take the shampoo out of my hair, Eli's assistant was straitening the wax lady's hair... Eventually Eli told her to stop doing what she was doing and clean out my hair and condition it. My husband had not arrived yet, so I figured I would stay and see if customer service improved. After being conditioned, I return to my seat and the towel unravels. My hair looked like a paint brush had run through it with funky colors. It was yellow and orange. He had not gone all the way to my roots, so it looked like a middle school friend dyed my hair. I immediately stopped him from working on another clients' hair to tell him that my hair looked awful with all the different colors and I even went back to where the chunk that he missed with the bleach was, so that he could clearly see how bad it was. He said, ""it's fine! It will look better when it's blow-dryed."" I then said that my hair had multiple colors in it and he told me the only way he could fix it was to put some toner in my hair that would cost an additional 80 dollars!!!? WHAT?! I was furious. He told me to sit there and think about it while he finished his other client. I stood up, threw the towel on the floor, grabbed my things, and headed for the door. He yelled, ""Where are you going?"" I said, ""My hair looks terrible and I'm not staying here."" He followed me out yelling profanity at me and told me to ""go home looking like shit"". 
I dont know if it's because of my groupon price that I was treated so poorly, but I will NEVER return or recommend anyone to go to Eli's.",Beauty

I haven't really heard of the place before, but the restaurant is located in the 64th floor of Thehotel. 

Upon exiting the elevator, you'll enter and pass through the lounge and bar area first. The lounge area has nice outdoor seating which has an amazing view of the Vegas strip with the Luxor pyramid right outside. The dining area was towards the back which was very open and bright even with the dimmed lights. We were seated in the booth area where you can see the pretty Vegas lights outside if your seat was facing the window.

They brought us a mixed bread basket which had four different types of bread (mini French baguette, pimiento bread, a dinner roll, and I think the other one was just white bread) with butter and peanut butter (butter that has chunks of peanuts in it). I loved the pimiento bread with the regular butter, but the peanut butter was also really good. I just wished that the butter was a little bit softer or melted so it's more spreadable on the bread.

We skipped the appetizers since we were getting full from the bread basket, but they had a good and solid selection. We decided to save stomach real-estate for dessert.

We mainly ordered from the Alaine Ducasse Classics menu as the waiter has suggested since that's what they're mostly known for. 

What we ordered:

*Roasted Main Lobster ""Au Curry"" - My boyfriend ordered this dish and I had a couple (ok, maybe a few) bites off his plate. It was so delicious! I really liked the coconut basmati rice that it came with. I was kinda jealous of his dish and wished I ordered the same thing. But I wanted to order something different so we can both try two things. They didn't skimp on the lobster portion and was actually very generous with it. He almost didn't finish the lobster because there were really big chunks. The lobster was cooked well and wasn't chewy. I just loved the flavor of the whole dish. I definitely recommend this dish if it's your first time here.

*Atlantic Seabass - Although I enjoyed my bf's dish, I still enjoyed what I ordered. The fish was just fresh and so meaty that it was very filling. My dish came with asparagus, octopus, littleneck au gratin, and baby squid. The octopus, littleneck, and baby squid were cooked really well and wasn't chewy. I'm always worried about seafood being overcooked since they get difficult to eat once it does. The asparagus was probably the best asparagus I've had in awhile. I kinda wish there was some sort of carb with this dish, but I figured that they skipped that because it'll end up being too heavy. Nonetheless, it was a very satisfying meal.

*Peach Melba - Mmmm soooooo good! We pretty much annihilated this dessert. It's a nice light dessert and a great way to end a good meal. 

They also brought us complementary fresh Madeleines with nutella dipping sauce after we ate our dessert. So we were pretty glad that we didn't order a chocolate dessert. 

Great ambiance. Friendly staff. Nice view. Highly recommended! I really enjoyed our dining experience here.",Restaurant
Q_cFR_WgdknXxGh0ABO3-g,HWonvGt2a73y_4_1xNmxCQ,JLbgvGM4FXh9zNP4O5ZWjQ,2015-10-12,"I have been wanting to try Meat & Potatoes for a long time now and finally had the opportunity to go to brunch last weekend on Sunday.  My friend and I had reservations for 2 people at noon, and we were seated promptly.  I had no idea what to expect, but given the reviews and my ideas of the place comparing it to other upscale restaurants in the area, I was wholly unprepared for the extremely loud music that assaulted our ears as we entered the dining area - the place was fairly crowded with people, but even with that the music drowned out the voices of everyone and it was difficult for us to even hear one another.  My friend has a medical condition that is exacerbated by loud noises (which had I known about the music volume here I would never have suggested eating here), and while the manager did kindly lower the volume a bit even with that, it was still uncomfortably loud even for me and I don't have the health issue that my friend does.  I despise going out to eat only to have my eardrums beaten down with loud music that makes it nearly impossible to have a conversation with the people you are with but given the very intimate nature of the seating (you are practically on top of the people next to you) I guess that the restaurant opted for loud music versus involuntarily eavesdropping on the patrons next to you.  So, as far as ambiance goes I rate it a 2 because of the too close seating and the loud music plus the tables are so small that it's nearly impossible to fit even 2 plates with drinks on each 2-seat dining table. 

Our server, whose name I don't remember was great - he was very attentive and accommodating.  I have zero complaints on the service.  The food was hit or miss, though the prices were comparable with local fine dining restaurants that serve Sunday brunch.  My friend wanted to try the fried taters so we decided to share those and this was by far my favorite part of our whole meal. The fries were well-seasoned and crispy on the outside while the center was still warm and soft - they were nearly the perfect french fries!  I'm not a big fan of aioli in general but their truffle mayo had a great flavor.  I had coffee, and it was decent coffee, but it wasn't great - there are much better cups of coffee at other restaurants around Pittsburgh but it was okay once I added cream and sugar.  I ordered the shrimp and grits as my entree and my friend ordered the roast beef eggs benedict with house hollandaise.  The shrimp and grits is covered in etouffee which I didn't really like as it overpowered the creaminess of the cheddar grits and detracted from the typical flavor of a traditional shrimp and grits.  It wasn't bad - I just didn't like the two flavor combinations together.  My friend said that the hollandaise sauce was lacking but at the same time she didn't mind because she said that it didn't taste like a traditional hollandaise sauce and that she wasn't happy with the flavor of it, but that she didn't mind the dish, but would have preferred no sauce or a traditional hollandaise instead.

The overall experience was a bit disappointing and underwhelming particularly given that I have heard so many good things about the place.  I would definitely go back if invited, but I won't make it a point to go here when there are so many other great restaurants in Pittsburgh.",Restaurant
oWAAb7DUjDxuxFyeZJYNhA,wQBYsVQ2UHxbhz8GqekK-A,Bkkwt8E9MHvgCHn4lUFtow,2013-01-20,"Let me start by saying that if there was a Yelp site where businesses got to rate and review their customers, I would receive less than 1 star from Roys after my visit a few nights ago. Me, and my girlfriends, may have been the worst table to ever step foot in their restaurant. They were thrilled to see us go.

We were staying at the property across the street from the Marriott, where Roys is located. It was a trip with several of my college girlfriends and we see each other only a few times a year. We looked over our restaurant choices and decided to go with Roys. We made reservations for 7:30 pm, got dressed up for our big night out, and headed across the street. We were 30 minutes early and this is where the problems began. Several of us, feeling in a celebratory mood, had consumed cocktails during the day and were feeling good when we arrived. Having 30 minutes to kill, we decided to enjoy a drink by the firepit. Vodka martinis with blue cheese olives (yum). Our cocktail waitress there must have been new because she struggled a bit, but whatever, we were having  fun. Unfortunately, vodka martinis on empty stomachs were NOT a good idea and by the time we were seated in Roys, a few of us were, well, blottoed. After one of my girlfriends announced ""I don't want to spend $40 on a meal right now because I want to drink my dinner,"" I realized that the night might not go quite as I had thought. So, we had a dilemma... do we get up and leave or do we stick it out? Right as we were debating that issue, our lovely waitress Laurie (from Illinois) came around the corner with our drinks. Our decision was made... we would stay. 

After the first round, we had to secretly--- via a finger across the throat--- indicate to Laurie that serving another drink to one member of our party would not be a good idea. She seemed in complete agreement and played along with us as we diverted attention away from an empty coaster. I then told her one of us was a vegan, which must be a nightmare for pretty much any restaurant. Not nearly as big of a nightmare, however, as food allergies which I also have. I informed her of that --- I'm allergic to shellfish. She gladly brought the vegan menu and I ordered something that sounded delightful. By the time, two of the party left in pursuit of cocktails rather than food. 

Long story short, my vegan meal showed up COVERED in green and red peppers which I am ALSO allergic to. I swear on the menu it said nothing about bell peppers and Laurie immediately offered to get me something else. While waiting, my girlfriend begged me to take my vegan hat off for a moment and try her delicious fish, which I did. When our waitress returned, my girlfriend asked what kind of fish it was. Laurie told her and all I heard was ""blah blah blah fish covered in a lobster sauce."" OMG. I just ate lobster!!!!!! I exclaimed as Laurie looked on in horror. She swiftly left the table and I tried to figure out what to do.  She then came back with the head waitress to discuss the situation, then with the manager who looked particularly unhappy but offered me an EpiPen. I had them box up my second vegan entree (which I ate the next day and it was great) and left without the EpiPen, but in search of Benadryl. 

Needless to say, Roys was thrilled to see us go. I think I saw a few rose petals floating behind me as we talked out. But they handled us so beautifully, especially our waitress, that I had to give them a 5 start review. Other than the bristle of the manager (which really, can you blame her?) they were fantastic to probably the worst table that has ever dined at Roys.",Restaurant
9ZfEgLfqphcdfVk27zsaAA,UyuWAvDcLp4zU1Wfc1PNXg,aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ,2012-02-27,"I have to tell you, I'm really loath to give five start reviews unless I feel they are really justified and I've had enough experience with a place to see how good they are on more than one occasion. Well, I ate at NOCA not just once but twice this weekend. Saturday I went with one set of friends and had the regular menu and cocktails and then on Sunday evening I went back for one of their Simple Sunday suppers, both experiences were excellent and with that, let me lax eloquent on said gastronomical interfaces with this fine establishment.

Saturday - Like a virgin, eating out for the very first time.

I'd gone to the Esplanade 14 to see a movie with friends (which is pretty amazing in and of itself so let me recommend dinner there and a movie at NOCAS as the movie theater has been upgraded with a bar in the foyer and assigned seating for the theaters). You come out of the movie theater, on 24th and Camelback and then just head down to 32nd and Camelback. Just look for the Safeway on your left and make a u-turn and muck like Binkley's in Cave Creek (which it reminds me of), it is essentially in a strip mall, though one which also houses the famous burger place Delux.

I had a cocktail which is not on the online menu right now but is made with egg whites, so a great throwback cocktail with a kick to it and cleanses the palate for the meal. By the way, dining starts with an amuse-bouche, just something tiny but delicious to tickle the palate, always a nice part of higher end dining and what reminded me of Binkley's. I also like that they keep the water on the table in an old fashioned cork bottle but it's table water, not a charge for it though I guess you could get sparkling water if you asked.

We had the foie gras option, which came with some sort of maple syrup sauce that really went well with the fatty texture of the goose liver and was about $23, a little rich for my blood but wow, I love a well done foie gras. We also had the tempura shitake mushrooms, not bad though not all that amazing. I tend to like Japanese style tempura and this was more of a batter.

I went on to have some sort of squid ink pasta with mussels and flakes of, I think, scallops, and it was in a wonderful lemon butter sauce. One of my friends had the duck breast and was kind enough to give me a piece and wow, probably one of the best cooked duck breasts I've had and I love duck breast. I did ask for a recommendation of a glass of wine to go with my pasta dish and got a grenache with a nice mineral backbone (so I'm cribbing from the waiter, sue me) that paired well with the seafood in my dish.

After the main course they come out with a big bowl of homemade cotton candy, which adds a fun flair and we also got the tripple pairing of gelato and some french pressed coffee. The gelato is a bit on the soft side to me and I would encourage the folks at NOCA to go try t he gelato at La Bocca on Mill avenue or at La Grande Orange, though the pistachio gelato was quite flavorful and so was the bourbon marshmallow flavor...I just think it needs to be more firm (e.g. NOCA, you are wonderful but work on that one).

Sunday - Simple Sunday Dinner - give it to me one more time

Now, since my first set of friends didn't want to go out Sunday, which is why I was there on Saturday, I took another set out Sunday night for their prix-fixe Sunday dinner menu. You have 3 or 4 options for appetizer and entree and one Sunday a month they offer the fried chicken option and since the next day was my annual physical, I had to have me some fried chicken.

My appetizer (and I hope my doctor is not reading this post) was the bacon soup option with the crispy potatoes and bacon drippings and folks, it was transcendent, with these little fluffy lumps of potatoes and in the bottom, chunks of smokey, salty bacon and a drizzle of bacon drippings floating on top. Ask for an extra order of bread to dip into the soup, you will not be disappointed.

For drinks they have a $30 bottle option, which I assume changes often but in this case we chose the Cab which was from ShareCropper's Wine company from Oregon and wow, it was perfect with my meal since it cut through my higher fat items. It was so good I had to order a second bottle and took half a bottle home to savor later.

For dinner, the fried chicken, which the chef brined with lemon and honey and this time at least, some sort of tea and then it was dipped in buttermilk with lots of Tabasco and then floured and friend..it is served on a fluffy pillow of mashed potatoes that must have gone through a food mill because they were super smooth and a light overlay of cream gravy (p.s. Noca, maybe a little more black pepper next time in the gravy). The crust was delicious and the chicken sweat and moist, it was lovely and I will come back next month and ahve it again. As for desert, out of space, cookie was a bit too hard but otherwise great.",Restaurant

I was taking out them out for both of their birthdays and I had heard great things of the Spa. I myself had been to the spa only once, but it was a very in-and-out ordeal (I had a pedicure on a quiet Monday evening a year ago). At that time, I did not get to see the spa nor take advantage of the amenities so this time I was determined to do so. One of my girlfriends had been there before and was also very excited to go back. Expectations were high for everyone.

Intro. Our appointment was for 12:45pm, but we arrived at 12pm to use the sauna, steam room, etc... The entrance to the spa is on the main level, but you have to go downstairs to check in. All 3 of us got the same package: facial or Swedish massage, Pedi and Mani. The hostess led us to the change room and it was busy and SMALL! I noticed that there were no chairs or seats. The lockers close to the walls are an arms-length away from the mirrors where people do their makeup, blow-dry hair, etc... In other words, be prepared to do a lot of bumping and grinding...and not the fun grinding either. In the middle of the change room, there are these hideous ""lounge chairs"" covered in a bright blue foam mattress where one can lie down, listen to music and close themselves off from the world by a curtain. No thanks. By the time us girls got everything ready, we were only able to spend 5 minutes in the sauna and out we went for our first treatment. Stressed at the Spa.

Facial Experience - I am glad I am still Alive. 

Because I always get massages, I opted for the facial treatment. My worst one ever. Nothing happened to my face (thank goodness), but rather, my facialist was horrible. Her Extractions were touches on my face. Her facial massage consisted of tiny pats and patters of fingers. No attention paid to my shoulder area. The arm and leg massage...did I even get it? There were moments of intense stress when there would be 15 minutes at a time of no movement and sound, except a snorting-sniffing sound (think the sounds made with err happy substances...)Anyways, a good facialist is hit or miss. If you know a good one, stick to her like the guns. Otherwise, you will just end up with a lacklustre experience.

Pedicure - Lovely. You cannot really go wrong with a pedicure. I got the Stop and Stare nail polish.

Manicure - Hilarious. The manicurists make all the difference I find. I learned everything from how to catch a guy from Macau and the best things in married life to one man for 35 years. Total Love for my manicurist.

Ambiance. The spa is way, way, wayyyy to small for the amount of people...on a Saturday afternoon...the day before Mother's Day. The change rooms are already too small, but the lounge is another matter entirely.

*WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! FIGHT TO THE DEATH FOR A SEAT OR BE AT RISK OF EVIL STARES AND SCATHING COMMENTS.*

We were at the lounge\/tea room sitting and talking while waiting for our nails to dry. We left some things at a table just in front of us. We all got up to collect the items (3 seconds) and when we turned around, someone had taken our seats. When one of my girlfriends stared at the Mama Blob Hawk, she in turn commented something to the effect of: Well you got up or you snooze you lose or etc...etc...

So, ladies and gents. Please be cautious. In parts of Florence, I would cation you of pick-pocketers. In Stillwater, I would caution you of seat-stealers. 

All in all, it could have been many things that may my spa day a complete let down: Busy, not intimate (which I think a spa should be), a non-relaxing facial and patrons who are... well, I will be genteel. For the money and time, I will definitely be going somewhere else. 

Oh, and by the way, your spa music choices are: Subway Rumble, Funeral March Classical Music (I kid you not), and The Cat's Meow.",Beauty
NKeHWZzIlqgiTIaeReZUYQ,82Nredvik6cag2-Y2kpxPw,QNfh79NwsNnl-AngRhg2ww,2013-03-20,"Recently, there is a hype around Kingyo Izakaya, the Vancouver-based Izakaya that has recently opened a store Toronto. We have heard a lot of good reviews about it and saw plenty pictures on facebook, even from our friend who tried in it Vancouver! JW and I couldn't bring ourselves to miss out on this!

Arriving around 7pm, Kingyo was not as crowded as Guu; the tables were placed fairly far from each other and there were not a lot of people.  Yet, for the same reasons, the atmosphere certainly didn't feel as lively. We were being seated at a huge table with live Kingyo (aka Goldfish) swimming in a fish tank that is embedded into the table. Very interesting!

I want to start off by saying that the food at Kingyo comes really really fast. Shortly after we ordered, we had 4 dishes on our table ranging from Seafood don and shooters and sashimi. I recommend one to ask the servers to slow down like we did or else you will be way too overwhelmed and won't be able to truly savour the food.

We started off with Mr. Sada's Sea Urchin Shooters. I was very very very excited about the sea urchin shooters because of the extremely pleasant experience I had at Chicago's Arami. Yet, I was quite disappointed with Kingyo's sea urchin shooter.

My excitement sank when I saw the raw egg floating on top. But that wasn't not their fault, it was just me so I just spooned out the egg. Following our server's instructions and mixing everything very well, I took a sip of the shooter. The stickiness and taste of the yam was just not my thing. The next thing I realized, there was rice in the shooter and it was kind of weird! I know you are supposed eat the rice with the sea urchin and the combination is perfect when you are eating a sea urchin sushi. But with the yam in the shooter that created the slimy texture, it was just not right. Even though with the freshness of the sea urchin in the shooter, the whole thing was rather tasteless.

Next, we had the Hamachi Carpaccio. This dish came with Hamachi along with salad vegetable and garlic oil drizzled on top. It was very delicious, but rather nothing surprising. At this point, we all know that garlic oil goes very well all kind of fish and we have tried this in many japanese restaurants. One thing I want to point out is that the fish at Kingyo was not very fresh. JW tried to taste pieces of fish on its own and said it wasn't fresh; it was the flavour added to it that covered up the lack of freshness in the fish.

Then, we had the Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don. This was also one of the dishes we looked forward to the most. Like sea urchin in a bowl of rice, can our lives get better? But, we were disappointed again. Although there was a generous amount of sea urchin sitting on top, the seafood don lacked a directing flavour; the seafood don had a very light soya sauce taste with a hint of vinegar. However, it was not strong enough to tie all the ingredients together. They were more like individual pieces that were put together by accident and did not really go together.

We also ordered the Aburi Toro & Avocado 2Tone Battera, which we expected to highly resemble Jabistro's ebi and salmon oshizushi. Yet, we were wrong again. The Toro wasn't fresh. The balance of rice and fish was off and there was too much rice. Although there was a sauce that tasted like vinegar and a hint of garlic oil, the sushi was extremely tasteless. Very disappointed.

Lastly, we had two sushi rolls from today's special menu. I forgot their names but I think they were spicy scallop roll and beef tataki roll. These rolls did its job by wrapping our meal with disappointment.

Expected the spicy scallop roll to taste like Blue Ocean Roll from ND sushi, the spiciness from mixing mayo with sriracha sauce was blunt and tasted exactly like spicy sashimi rolls found in all japanese bentos. Totally not worth the $10 or even more.  

The sauce on the beef tataki roll was quite surprising and went pretty well with the fried noodles-like thing on top. But the beef was tough and hard-bitten.

verdict:

not roasted

We entered the restaurant with excitement and left with disappointed. Everything was very disappointing. We will not come back for sure.

hIARrjpAodyW-Czyl2WHog,OUtjpGVqOa9jRLrHxnOvig,wyFV6UN--hH_ifbvdsjSkQ,2011-02-15,"To put it in one line Fleming's is a 3-star restaurant posing as a 5-star restaurant.

The issue for me at my visit to Flemings was service.  The hostess was rather unenthusiastic.  It seemed was just her job to point us in the correct direction, which was the bar to wait as our table got prepared.  For a 5-star place, a reservation is a reservation, and the table should darned well be ready when advertised.  I expect to wait for a table at Outback, with the little buzzing and flashing beeper, but Flemings isn't Outback.  Right?  And as I will state later, getting the food orders correct was an even larger issue.

For background, I was part of a large group (11 people) for dinner.  The bread served before the meal was absolutely delicious; fresh, hot, with a crispy crust, tender middle.  Drinks and salads were ordered.  I got a Caesar salad, and all I can say is that it was adequate. I have had a better Caesar salad at my employer's cafeteria.  But, I'm not there for the salad.  Fleming's is all about steaks.  

The server moved around the table and took orders.  Our server was cheery and tried to make small-talk conversation with the table.  She took the orders where overall there were 8 steak orders (some of the couples got one meal and split it) and various sides.  I ordered the prime rib-eye; whenever I go to a steak place, it is my benchmark meal.  When the food arrived I had a very nice, although I would call it a bit small piece of Filet Mignon in front of me.  A very nice cut of meat, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Also, one of the couples at the table was not brought any food.  So, doing the math, the serving staff has a 25% chance in bungling your order.  The staff re-took the incorrect\/missing orders and about 5 minutes later the manager was by to apologize.  The couple who had the missing order was offered a shrimp cocktail; I was not.  Maybe that is why I'm the odd person at the table.  I started munching on the community sides watching my other friends enjoying their steaks.  As for the sides, they were adequate like the Caesar salad; nothing to see here; although the Fleming potatoes were better than average.

About 15 minutes later, my steak arrived, a bit rare for medium rare.  Gee that would make it rare.  I was hungry, and I ate it anyway.  The steak was very nice.  Tender and tasty, the way a good rib-eye ought to be.  To be honest it was one of the best rib-eyes I ever had, although slightly undercooked.  Much more tender than ones in those cowboy steak places.  There is something about the flavor of fat from a good rib-eye, and that is why it is my benchmark steak.  I was not alone on the notion under-cooked nature of the steak.  I guess from a management standpoint, undercooked is better than overcooked.  But I am of the school nothing goes back unless I am always within eyesight of my food.  I've seen the movie ""Waiting"".  

We got desserts, and did them community style.  The walnut turtle pie seemed to be the best liked.  I didn't do the walnut turtle pie.  Walnuts are a bit bitter for my tastes.

The timing for delivery of food was a bit slow.  This was ""European"" dining.  Reservation at 6:30, offered dessert 9:30.  So, in a way we owned the table for the evening, or maybe the staff realized they were not going to turn the table for another customer, and with a large group tip was set, so there was no need to hustle for the tip.  Slow service is fine, if that is what you expect.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed chatting with my other friends at the table, but this was not typical ""American"" dining service.  On the good side, the water glasses were filled with great regularity.  Water glasses were 12 oz glasses, and these glasses never got below half full.  Service from the bar was not as good.  I ordered a glass of Shiraz before the salad, and the glass arrived after the salad.  So, about 20 minutes to get my glass of house Shiraz.

With respect to the food errors, the manager did deduct the two meal errors from the bill, and that was very generous from Fleming's management.  But mistakes like this will crush high end places.  From a profit perspective, that's $80 that Flemings management isn't going to get, and a not so stellar review on Yelp.
So for me, I give Flemings a 4-star for food, 3-star for service, and a 2-star for value.

As for me, I'm not a high end restaurant guy, but from the small amount of travel I do for the company I work for, I have seen some higher end restaurants.  I was expecting penultimate experience, and I received an Outback level service experience.  

Ultimately, the question is: ""Did you get what you paid for""?  For my money, it is a resounding no.  But Flemings is in the business to appease business types with expense reports and such.  It is sufficiently snooty enough to impress your customer, so the corporate sales guy can give the impression to his customers that the company he represents ""cares"".",Restaurant
ok0fqd6Qo8-mBcOX1wfvUA,rRrFcSEZOTw6iZagsIwTFQ,7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA,2014-09-29,"I came here on a Saturday night, with a Groupon. It's a small establishment with a compact parking lot, and both were jam-packed. Luckily, someone was leaving as I was pulling into the lot, so I was able to grab a spot. (I don't know if they have an overflow lot, but they should.) 

Once inside, I quickly observed the ""Please Wait to be Seated"" sign.  We were asked how many were in our party, after which the hostess\/waitress (they seem to be one in the same) scurried off to assess the availability.  As said earlier, it was packed, and there were others also waiting.  I was thinking we'd have to wait forever and that my starving spirit animal would come bursting out of my abdomen, like in those beef jerky commercials. But we ended up waiting no more than about 5 minutes before we were shown to a booth. (I love booths!)

DESIGNATED VEGAN MENU:
There's a vegan menu inserted inside of their regular menu.  The waitress said that patrons keep taking them out, so if you want the vegan menu and don't see it, just ask for one. 
The vegan options include appetizers, hot stuffed sandwiches, pasta, calzone, pizzas, and desserts.  It wasn't listed on the menu, but they also have a vegan cheesecake, which you can get topped with chocolate syrup or mixed berry sauce. 


My order:
Veggieballs in buffalo hot sauce -  They are described as vegan meatballs, so I'm thinking faux-beef ""meat"" balls. I was pleasantly surprised when I cut into one and found actual vegetables: peas, string beans, carrots, & corn. They were positively delicious. A slightly crispy coating covered in a proper buffalo sauce, which had a legit heat level. Excellent dish for only $5.95. Comes w\/ vegan ranch and carrot sticks. 

Vegan Spaghetti with soy sausage, $8.50 - (Beautiful presentation.) The pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce and the soy sausage were bland, however.  Aside from flavor, I don't know what to say that it was lacking. A dash of this? A splash of that? Not sure, but it was a pretty big boring bowl of blah. I kept furiously twirling my fork in the saucy mix, thinking that maybe the flavor was at the bottom somewhere, clicking its heels thrice and trying to get back home, but no luck. If you avoid salt\/seasoning (and flavor), as well as meat, then this is your dish. I liked the vegan garlic bread though. 


Dessert-
Vegan cheesecake w\/ mixed berry sauce, $6.50 - I never ate cheese before going vegan, but I used to eat cheesecake (weird, I know), so I do have something with which to compare vegan versions. I have had some better-than-real-cheesecake vegan cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them. I did not like it. The cheesecake had a weird, grainy, earthy taste to it. And it was like, almost smooth & creamy, (*singing* Ooooh, we're 1\/2 way theeeere...) but it didn't quite make it there.  Silver lining? The crust and mixed berry sauce were both good.

Angel bites, $4.95 - (If you've ever been to France or New Orleans, think beignets, except here, they are vegan.) They cover theirs with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they offer you one of 3 dipping sauces: agave, chocolate, or caramel. (The caramel is NOT vegan, fyi.) I chose the chocolate. O-M-G. These suitably named bites of awesomeness brought me life. They came out hot, fresh & ready to be devoured. This is one of those treats that you want to eat right away because you know they won't taste the same later. But they give you so many! (Which is a great thing!) You can easily share this dessert with 2 or more people.


Non vegan:
My non-veggie DD got the Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer, and the Cajun Chicken Alfredo pasta w\/ shrimp added. She liked the pasta, but said it was definitely spicy.  



Nice ambience, especially for dates. I don't know if they take reservations, but I suggest asking, especially for busy weekend nights.  As busy as they were, the staff was still nice and attentive. The owner was making rounds and asking patrons how their meals were. Cool little bistro. Great for vegans dining with omnivores.  I'll go back for more buffalo Veggieballs and Angel Bites.",Restaurant
5s2ZK2XHDZJhyGBmkiAl9g,B_deeFbDdY6_e3aAPUyOtw,-wacMjBR6_gz1AAGlulSDQ,2015-03-30,"I originally would have given this establishment 5 stars, but now it's 3 due to my most recent experience.

I chose this establishment for my birthday since I had been there before and generally had an overall 4 to 5 star experience. The first time I went there, I was with a friend and was given complimentary food to try. The service was extremely efficient then and the wait for food wasn't long at all. I had such a wonderful time, I knew I would want to come back!

The second time I brought another friend, the service wasn't as friendly as my first experience. We still had a decent enough time and mustered it up to the staff just having a ""bad day"".

I reserved one of the booths in their back section for the birthday celebration for a friend of mine and for myself. When I called to make the reservation, I was told that someone would call me back closer to the date to confirm food, drinks etc. 

I never received a voicemail to confirm anything prior to my event. On the evening of my reservation, I received a very rude call from the establishment which started off with ""We have been trying to call you to confirm, but you haven't called us back"". No ""How are you?"" or any other polite salutations. I was very put off by the attitude of the gentleman on the phone.

There was not one voicemail left on my phone from their venue prior to my reservation. I am the type of person to not answer phone calls from unknown numbers. If it's important, someone will leave a message.

When we arrived, we were escorted to our area by one of the staff. We were told to put all our bills together to receive their promotions and that it would be much cheaper to do so. 

The experience itself was fine. Service was timely (although the food was an awful long wait). The sheesha tasted fine - all 16 of my guests seemed to be having a good time. We did have a space issue since the staff gave away some of our reserved section to other guests as they needed the space, but we managed to pull out chairs for ourselves and sit on the arms of the couches etc.

Generally speaking, myself and my guests had a wonderful time, but my dismay comes to the bill.

That evening, I asked one of the staff what my total was, and they provided me a number. No print-out, just a number. Since I wanted to pay for the entire party, I went to the front and provided them with my debit card. The machine prompted for a tip, which I decided to give in cash (in my opinion, the tip I gave was very generous).

When I asked for a printout of the bill, the staff member seemed very hesitant to give it to me. I had to insist on the printout multiple times before it was given to me.

Since I paid for everything right before they closed, I took the printout and decided I would look at it the next day.

The next day, boy was I surprised. The pricing was completely all over the place. They charged for water anywhere between $0.36 to $1.50. I was under the impression that all their water was $0.36 since every other visit I had prior, it was charged at this price.

Additionally, the tip was already included on the bill (I was never informed of this protocol when I made my reservation, when I had everyone put their bills together, or when I was paying). This ended up in me giving me the establishment an $120 gratuity for the evening.

I'm not saying I ""regret"" giving them $120 for the evening. Of course their staff deserve it as I am aware they work very hard. Although, the service during my event was definitely lacking. I would have appreciated some more transparency regarding this.

It's a lesson learned for me to check the bill before I pay it. I just feel that this was an extremely dishonest way for me to end my experience with this venue. They could have let me know beforehand that the gratuity was included (many establishments inform their patrons of this, especially for large group bookings). The inconsistency in terms of the pricing on the bill was a big turn off. If water is $1.50, then it's $1.50. If it's $0.36, then it's $0.36. It cannot be both.

Additionally, my very first experience here as I mentioned earlier was amazing! I felt like they appreciated my business.

This time around, not at all. 

Their sheesha is good, food is delicious, and the staff are friendly.

To me, the dishonesty I feel that I experienced with them will be the assurance that I won't return.

Tip: For large bills, make sure to keep track of what you order and check your bill very carefully before paying.",Shopping

I've passed Panevino and at one point worked around the corner for years and have always said one day I'm going to try this place. Well that one day finally came, and it was well worth the wait. My lady told me to pick any restaurant to dine at for my Birthday, and though a more popular strip restaurant came to mind I went with Panevino. First let me say Panevino exceeded our expectations. This place is amazing! I personally feel finding a great place to dine that has great food, environment and customer is extremely rare in Las Vegas and Panevino has perfected all areas. Upon entering Panevino the first thing you'll notice is how clean, fresh, casual, laid back and classy the dining area is. To the west of the building there is also a bar and lounge. At around 6 o'clock in the evening they raise the curtains to reveal an extraordinary view of the Las Vegas Strip and McCarran Airport. Customer service is just ridiculously awesome. Everyone you interact with is extremely pleasant and welcoming, it feels like you've been there before and they really missed you. The food is exceptional! We started off with wine, bread and an olive oil with balsamic vinegar mix. The bread was fresh, the olive oil had a rich nutty flavor and I know this sounds crazy but even the water tasted refreshing, not like the typical funny tasting tap water you get at lesser quality restaurants. I love Riesling wine but it is very hard to find in restaurants and if they do have it its not very good. We next ordered Crab Cakes for our appetizer which were crispy Maryland-style crab cakes with honey-mustard dressing, and though $20 for two crab cakes the size of silver dollars may seem expensive, you will definitely want to order more. That $20 will seem like a few pennies for the best crab cakes ever! After being amazed by our appetizer we were extremely excited about our main course meals. My lady ordered the Rigatoni Blackened Chicken which consisted of rigatoni with blackened chicken breast, sautéed mushrooms, onions and roasted bell peppers in a spicy tomato sauce. Her dish tasted fresh and authentic. I ordered the Assorted Grilled Fish which consisted of grilled lobster, salmon, shrimp, scallops, tuna and Chilean sea bass on a bed of sautéed spinach and roasted potatoes drizzled with lemon sauce. I experienced a sense of euphoria with this dish lol. All jokes aside, if you close eyes while eating this meal you will feel like you're dining along the ocean side in Southern California. Rarely do we ever order desert because nine times out of ten we get some type of generic brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream, but not at Panevino! We ordered the Panevino Trio which was a tasting trio of crème brûlée, tiramisù, and lemon pastry cream Napoleon. Only thing I can say about the desert is try not to lick the plate, it might be frowned upon in this type of establishment. This year my dinner experience was the highlight of my birthday and there is no need for my lady to ask me where I want to dine next year... I'm going to PANEVINO!",Restaurant
Llm0z9eD2m7SlSAbM3I8XQ,7V29xzsIxlHfdcHsnpHB3Q,mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw,2013-05-07,"WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD.

I am not exaggerating in the least bit.  The series of events that occurred in the hour and 20 minutes we were here completely put a negative damper on the rest of my family's night

Let me preface this by saying that as a higher-end restaurant in a downtown area, located near the all the theaters, a place like this should check to show schedules and plan and staff accordingly.  Obviously the place was understaffed because we were not the only ones getting up from their tables to complain to the manager.  

Because I took into account that it would be a busy night in the area, I scheduled far ahead and made a nice reservation.  We got there promptly at 6 and were all delighted by the beautiful decor.  I knew we may run into a problem when we all knew what we wanted before anyone even greeted us at our table because we sat there for a little under 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us at the table.  

Regardless, quarter after 6 rolls around, and we place our orders completely: appetizers, salad, and main entrees.  It took a while for the appetizers to come out, but I thought maybe that was just this place's take on the classic ""take your time"" Italian setting, which I am not opposed to.  So, I was fine waiting a little bit so our table actually had the time to talk.

Once the appetizers did arrive, I was a little shocked at the portion.  There were just about 3 bites of greens and beans to go around for $8 and the beans weren't even cooked enough... I mean what I had was delicious, but since we all shared a couple appetizers, I only had one bite.  Same with the octopus: served atop of the most beautiful plate.  It looked elegant, but it was pretty measly.  However, I understand the smaller portion of octopus because it's obviously a more expensive ingredient than the greens that go into making greens and beans.  I digress...

Another 15 mins goes by, then finally the wedge salad that my parents ordered arrived.  Now this wedge salad was the best part of our meal.  In fact, it was damn near delectable.  But it was soon easily overshadowed by my hunger and the look around the dining area to see many people waiting for their meals.

At this point I started to get nervous: it was getting close to show time, and I could feel that our food was no where near ready to arrive to our table.  No less, I felt optimistic when we asked our waiter after another 10 mins when our meals would be coming.  He responded, ""well, it won't be 20 minutes, maybe more like 5 or a few.""  He gave the excuse that the cook is bringing the food out in the order it came into the kitchen.  Well, bullshit because the gentlemen who came in 20 mins after we ordered complained about their meals running late, and soon after their plates arrived.

**FUNNIEST MOMENT OF THE NIGHT: At this point the manager came over, saw our empty table, and stack of appetizer plates, and asked how our meals were!  You kidding, I almost killed over.  This is when he then told us the ""there's a show, and we are running behind"" excuse.  

I am sorry, but when I plan ahead and make a reservation because I am so excited to eat at this place and start my night off right, the last thing I want to hear are these dumb excuses and being told to just wait a little longer is even worse.

It was 15 minutes to show time.  We had officially been sitting there at this restaurant for an hour and fifteen minutes.  It was time to throw in the towel, and hurry and make our way to the show.  My father asked our waiter for the check for everything we had eaten and told him we were leaving.  Well, he brought the check, and GUESS WHAT, it had all the entrees on it!  

Instantly, my mother jumped up, and I never let my mother get mad in public, especially at a restaurant in the restaurant setting.  I never think its cool to yell at a staff member or a manager, but this time was different.  This was easily the worst restaurant experience I had ever had.  What's worse is that I was so excited to eat here.  I had spent time looking at the menu the week before and getting excited about what dish I was going to eat.

When my mom went and talked to the manager, he had his face planted on the kitchen computer screen.  She told him our series of events and how it was ridiculous, and then she said we were leaving and she asked how much we owed for what we had eaten so far, and he said he didn't want anything.  At least at this point I left with some respect for the guy that he didn't fire back or state that he wanted the $25 for the food we ate.  

As we left, I was so upset.  Like I said, I had been looking forward to this night for the past 6 months, and I was extremely excited about trying this place after I had read all the reviews.  I was very upset with the way the night ended.  Sadly I will probably never be back, and every time I am near Market Square or think of that night and show, this poor experience will be in the back of my mind.",Restaurant
_4gPnztkZEcq8Vb7YGzn8g,ahT2P-3MQLSWltjAvPJ6Ng,IUILfovsQ7M1Z4oehbjuSQ,2014-06-02,"We started using Abe's Pools & Spa's in October 2013 after finding his store on Cave Creek Rd by happenstance as is next to our piano dealer. We had just bought a house with a pool and where new to pool care. When liked that Abe specialized in used pool equipment as we thought it would lead to more cost effective repairs. 
We were also in the market for a used Spa and I had seen some used refurbished Spa's at AZ Spa World but Abe happened to have a couple waiting to be restored. We liked that Abe was a small local business so we decided to give him the business. We agreed to pay the same price as the others being sold at AZ Spa World.
We then had Abe out to the house to start up weekly pool cleaning service as well as a few repairs. We had a chlorinator installed and the diving board replaced. We also wanted the pool drain cover replaced but Abe told us the water was too cold and it would need to wait until summer when the pool was at least 80 degrees.
A few weeks after we purchased the spa it was delivered and it took Abe's crew about two more weeks to get it up and running. It was never fully restored as originally agreed and we were left to have to refinish the exterior our self. In addition we had problems with the spa heater and leaks for about 2 months before they finally got it right. Knowing then what I know now I would have purchased from AZ Spa World.
Between October 2013 and May 2014 our weekly pool service went by without issue. Our service was always provided by serviceman Aaron who was always through, kind and good with our dogs.
During the 8 month period we used Abe's service anytime I had to call the office for a billing issue or a service question my inquiries were always handled in a very loose manner that ruffled my feathers.
In the last week of May, Aaron the pool guy told me my backwash valve was leaking and needed repair. I also noted that the pool was finally 83.7 degrees! I called the office to schedule the valve repair as well as the drain cover replacement. After 8 months of staring at the ugly broken drain I was ready to have a new one!
I called the office to schedule the repairs on Friday, May 23rd and spoke with Kim (Abe's wife). She noted both issues and we made an appointment for Tuesday May 27th. On Tuesday the 27th I waited for the tech and I had called the office to confirm arrival time of the tech. I again spoke with Kim and she confirmed he was on his way. She then said, ""oh, by the way, we won't be doing the drain repair. They guys say it's still too cold"" I then objected, saying Abe had told me 80 degrees was fine and I have now waited 8 months. I said if he won't do it now, when he will do it. She responded by saying ""sorry, I don't know what to tell you."" Thus ended our conversation.
The tech arrived shortly thereafter and I showed him the problem with the pool valve. I told him I would be inside when he is ready for me...About 30 minutes pass and I go out to check on him and I see the repair is complete and he is gone. He did not provide an estimate before completing the work and my pool drain cover still not done.
I called the office the next day, Kim answered the phone. I explained the issue to her and expressed my frustration. I then asked her exactly how much they were going to be billing me for this unauthorized repair. She pulled up the work order and told me it was a $15 repair plus a $75 service call fee. WHAT! I expressed that a service call fee was never disclosed and an estimate was never provided for approval. I She interrupted me by saying ""well, it's not free."" I never expected it to be free but I do expect to be told of costs upfront beforehand. I told Kim right then and there this is not the way I do business and that I wished to cancel all services on my account effective immediately. I had a $62 credit on my account we agreed they would keep that credit to cover the repair and we would call it even.
Abe's tested my patience to the limit. I need service that takes its business more seriously. Abe's has been in business since 1975 and it shows. Their practice of business and way of talking to people is outdated. They are not competitive and they seem burnt out. They should probably sell and retire!
I would not recommend Abe's services. What you may save in cash you will pay for in quality and inconvenience.",Shopping
t9z8WmKU3uR1XcJVsP_vvw,b34yOQoUDev_l6BzDBMpUQ,6-6s-ZBtAt-c64EQ8il0Zw,2010-09-28,"I decided to take the owner up on her offer of a dozen free cupcakes, which she offered after reading my original review to try to entice us to give her business another chance. I called ahead of time to let them know the situation and that I would be stopping by. The lady on the phone said that I could pick the order up at anytime before the close of business. 

Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted by a staff member. I then informed them that I was there to pick up the aforementioned cupcakes. Roughly a minute later, I was greeted by the owner and promptly questioned as to ""whyyyy"" I had posted a negative review on Yelp. She then asked why I had not called them personally to express my concerns about the cake tasting. I explained to her that Yelp is an open site, and consumers are free to share their reviews\/experiences, whether they be good or bad. At which point she agreed, but still seemed displeased. 

She mentioned that the bakery never charges for tastings. They merely require a deposit of $20 via a credit card. If a customer fails to show for their cake tasting appointment, the credit card is charged. I stated that it appeared to be a miscommunication by her staff, as I was led to believe that I was being charged for the tasting. On this point, I was incorrect in my original review. 

She gave me the cupcakes (They were were cold. Which, I found strange) and said, ""I hope you post a better review this time."" To which I stated, ""Well I hope we like the cupcakes."" I promptly thanked her and took the cupcakes, (a random assortment chosen by the staff before my arrival) and left to go home and call my fiance to vent. 

My fiance and I will most likely will not be eating all of them, but for the ones we do taste, our opinions are as follows - 

Better Than Sex Cake - The fudge was tasty; a little thick, but some people like it that way. The cake itself was soggy and the flavor was somewhat flat. The caramel was a plus but could barely be tasted. I believe the caramel is the reason why the cake was soggy. The whipped cream filling and toffee pieces were a delicious accent. Very messy. 

Little Deb - The fudge frosting was good, but again too thick. The whipped cream filling again was delicious. The cake was dry and again somewhat flat. 

Plain Jane - The cake was dry, however the cream filling was delicious. 

Plain Jack - The cake was moist and the filling was tasty. Out of all of them, I think we liked this the best. 

Oreo - The cake was pretty moist. The whipped cream filling was again a hit. The more you eat the frosting, the more the Oreo flavor comes through. 

Cosmos - The cake was dry. Raspberry filling was decent, very tart. The coconut was a nice touch. The frosting was overly sweet. 

Boston Cream - Pretty good. And I'm not a big fan of cream style pies. The cake was very moist. 

Spumoni - The pistachio Bavarian cream filling was more like a pudding. The green color threw me at first, but i overcame my fear of snot colored food and sampled some. The cake was moist. 

Cake of the Month - PB&J. The peanut butter frosting, terrible. The cake was moist and there was actual grape jelly inside. That flavor combo was not bad. If they could have actually used peanut butter, instead of the peanut butter frosting, it would have probably been better together. 

Now that we've OD'd on sugar, we can safely say that the cake was overall dry. The frostings were neither a hit nor a miss. The whipped filling was the star of the cupcake. Its safe to say that if we're in the mood for cupcakes, I'll save myself the money and make them myself at home.

We entered into the NASCAR contest and both the hubby and I received a complimentary room, but the room had to be booked by June 1st. We always stay for our anniversary in July, so we called and were pleasantly surprised to know that not only would we be able to both use our comped rooms, but when we asked about additional comped rooms, we were connected to the Pit and received an additional room and also the other 2 nights would be ""hotel rate"" (whatever that is). 

We are from Tucson and usually always drive to Vegas. Since we have been going to the South Point, we have always lugged our own luggage across the casino which isn't desirable being that we have a 6 hr ride. We have learned (and if you're reading this, I urge you to do the same) to utilize the bell hop and they will bring your luggage up to the room. You just have to call with your ticket number once you enter your room. They do take their time, but it's a nice service seeing as we stay for 5-6 days and pretty much pack our house (to include a huge cooler with goodies inside). 

When you check in, they give you a coupon book. There are tons of discounted things and free drinks in the coupon book and it's usually good for the entire year. USE IT. Also, get a players card at the CLUB. And use that when you gamble. Although big brother is watching, it in essence got us our 5 nights comped. We're not high rollers either. 

This is a great casino because you really don't have to leave. They have a bowling alley, top-rated Bingo room and also a movie theatre. They also have like 11 restaurants from quick meals to fancy sit-down meals. They have a fantastic sports book with a nearby horse racing section. We have eaten the faster paced meals such as Steak N Shake (a fave) and at Baja Miguel's. Baja Miguel's has this great salsa \/ hot bean dip \/ guacamole and chips that they bring you. The guac is more than I would receive had I paid for it as a side at any Mexican restaurant and the bean dip...I gotta try to recreate that recipe. We have also eaten at their buffet and at the Coronado Cafe (you can't beat late-night meals for $3). The only down side to this offering is it seems people hold off from 11:30-midnight when they offer the select meals at this reduced price. It's almost better to pay the extra few bucks before you stand in line for 45 minutes for some eggs and bacon. 

They also have a complimentary shuttle form the airport to the casino and vice versa. When we fly, we definitely take advantage of that. There is a similar shuttle for $8.50 each person round trip that will take you to 3 different casino's on the strip. Definitely a must do for those times you don't want to pay an obscene amount for a taxi (and maybe even Uber \/ Lyft). 

Their gaming is great. We only play one table game and the dealers are usually pretty friendly. I know I'm going to casino and I'm going to donate a certain amount of our hard earned money. There is nothing worse than an employee with a nasty attitude to boot. I only experienced this one time from someone you wouldn't think would give attitude. We were playing Roulette and one of the Casino Floorperson...her name started with an S...not a Pit Boss during the day kept rolling her eyes at the patrons and Dealers. I don't know if she knew them on a level that she felt she could roll her eyes at them, but that put a sour taste in my mouth. Needless to say, we cashed out right after that. I didn't need her attitude AND to know I was going to give them money to boot didn't sit well. I'm all about the ambience especially when I know I'm going to be donating. Their dealers split their tips. We always tip when we win - I look at it like karma...I win, the dealer wins. However, the cocktail waitresses don't have to split their tips. I don't understand how they can have attitude. I'm not belligerent or anything like that, so when I ask for a drink and the chick knows we're there a few times a year AND WE TIP, why does she have to give me attitude? If that was me, I'd hustle but I guess whatever floats her boat. Again, ambience!
 
The one down side to this casino, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars is the pool area. We were there a week ago and it seems every time we were in the pool the LifeGuards were on their whistles yelling ""off the fountain, please"" or ""no jumping please"". I totally get that kids will be kids and perhaps this goes to parents reading this review as well. Please read the rules of the pool and don't allow your kids to jump into the 3 or 4"" pool cuz that's just silly. And don't allow them to play on the fountain. Maybe the casino should take the fountain out of the kids pool all together or put a metal grate over it. My ultimate wish is that they made an adults only pool. Not that I want to get frisky, but I want to relax when I'm on my vacation.

6g8motMQx5Oj0xBYA8pXLg,qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,trMrmg0EKcxEYAkqLBbRMA,2012-12-22,"Last night, my friend was telling me about this new BBQ place and that he had wanted to try it.  I had never heard of it before, and thought it sounded like a good idea.  After checking out their website, I thought, why the heck not?

So, I shuffle down to this side of town, looking forward to a new BBQ place.  I had read several of the reviews before i left and went in with an open mind not really knowing what to expect.

Well, lets say its not what I had hoped it would be.  At first glance, the menu seemed decent enough, but as I spent time going through it, I realized they didn't have a lot of what I had expected for a BBQ place.  I guess this place is a popular stop at the AZ fair, at least according to their website and pamphlet at the restaurant.  When you walk in, the place is colorfully decorated, with plenty of seating, and lots of fair themed stuff.  Their really hip on promoting themselves as an AZ state fair vendor, and that's okay.  The decor reflects this.  Pretty cool, and probably the only thing that really left a halfway decent impression on me. (colorful decorations, lots of fair ride chairs throughout the place, decorated napkin holders with AZ state fair pictures on them, etc.)

After I went through their menu, I realized it was half American food and half BBQ.  Well, half burgers and have BBQ really.  I had questions about their BBQ, and was kinda dissapointed with the selection.  NO shredded beef or chicken, and no Brisket.  Just BBQ'd beef cut into slices and chicken parts.  Um, why can't I get shredded beef or chicken? Isn't that sorta standard fair for places like this?

So, we ordered our food at the counter and for 2 adults, it cost $34.06! HOLY CRAP THAT WAS EXPENSIVE.  I got the BBQ beef sandwich with a baked potato side, with a drink.  My friend went with the cheese fries, a sandwich and a drink.  It just seemed outrageously priced, and we were both shocked at the price point. If I wanted to spend $35 on dinner, I can think of a million different places to go besides here, and get a nicer meal with a waiter and a cool, fun atmosphere! 

So, we go sit down for our food, and we wait.  and wait.  and we wait some more.  Finally, after an extended period of time, my drink ran out and we were starting to think they forgot about our order.  My drink was running low, so I figured I would go refill it and check on the status of our order.  Mind you, there was a soda fountain to the hard right of the entrance.  I went there and realized they only had half the selection of drinks that the order counter did.  so, I schelp to the register, get my drink refilll and ask about my order.  They said it was the next ticket up and it would be a few more minutes. ok, so I sat back down.

I got back to my table and they brought out our food.  It was okay, but not $35 dollars awesome.  The beef was okay, and the potato was awesome, but the place is laid out really weird.  I couldn't find any silver ware, but my friend found it and he grabbed us both forks and such.  They also had a burger bar area, with napkins, straws, salad dressings, lettuce and all the burger toppings you would need.  (I think this is where he found the forks, but both of us missed the forks and had to ask where they were.  They were in a dispenser off to the side that neither one of us saw the first time we went to the counter.

Overall, I wasn't impressed.  Primarily over the really high price point here, and the fact that the food was just okay.I mean, the food wasn't bad at all, but after having some sticker shock at the bill, it kind of overshadowed the goodness of what we ate.  I've eaten at other burger and BBQ places, spent half the amount, and had WAY better food across the board.  

Overall, neither one of us plan on going back. I will say the service was awesome, and I wish more service was like this, but overall, the whole experience left us disappointed and I don't think we will be back any time soon.",Restaurant

I chose Dr. T because I read he dealt with high risk & my last pregnancy developed pre-e at 21 weeks & was hospitalized & delivered at 29 weeks. I Told this to my Dr at the beginning to let him know to watch me. Never liked his medical assistant. She always seemed like she was in a bad mood & whenever you asked questions she would say things like ""it was in your handout we gave you"" & then she would answer very monotone and put out. Scheduling with YOUR dr was completely ridiculous. Always on vacation or on call or not in the office that day and if you WORK it's hard to get into their tight schedule of m-f 8-4 & some of us have to use sick time or PTO to get into these appointments. The scheduling department was always rude if you called and couldn't work around the dr. I have never had so many problems trying to get appointments with my Dr. Even if it was important and he said I had to be seen within the next two days they would have to call his medical assistant because I would have to get snippy and say well idk what to do he wants to see me in three days and you're telling me I can't get in. I was sick of having his nurse practitioner who didn't know anything about my medical history at all & mentioned to me my Dr had my chart listed as a girl when I was pregnant with a boy. She actually told me that. I never asked for anything, never asked questions & dealt with my im personable quick little 10 minute appointments & would always think how over packed this office was and no wonder the appointments are so short & left you feeling like you were just a check to these people. I hit about 31 weeks and knew I was getting pre-e again. I went to Walgreens and had my BP checked because I was So swollen. It was elevated so I called the triage line & they told me to come in. I came in and the medical assistant was her rude self and then MY Dr came in & said ""so what brought you in today. Your blood pressure isn't thaaat elevated. You wouldn't want to get something called preeclampsia.""I was blown away. Like he didn't even remember me or my medical history. At 34 weeks with my blood pressure creeping up and being extremely swollen I called and asked to be put on bedrest after seeing his nurse practitioner who told me to take Claritin because my stuffed nose and Mucous cough was 'allergies.' The medical assistant called me and told me I can't put you on bed rest for a chest cold and being swollen. I said oh silly me I thought when you have had pre-e & were  showing signs of it again and are miserable, sick, & uncomfortable at work you had the option to take time off before the baby comes to feel better. She said no. But girls at my work who were at the same point in their pregnancy were on bed rest by choice. And their dr had no issue with it. So whatever I dealt with their answer and sure enough Not even two weeks later i have an appointment and BAM preeclampsia & extreme high blood pressure. Was sent to the hospital right away and spent the night. Sent home by his colleague the next morning and the next day was told to come back in for monitoring & put back in the hospital AGAIN the next day & had an emergency csection THAT night & delivered my son at 36 weeks who was only 4lbs because I had preeclampsia. I had not had an ultrasound since 24 weeks after ruling out my placental prévia went away. Had they given me more ultrasounds It might have been caught that my son was measuring so far behind. Could not believe my Dr was not delivering my son. It was like I hardly saw him the whole entire time, had to fight to be heard something was wrong and then had a Dr I had never seen or heard of deliver my son she used surgical glue on my incision. My last csection was staples and dissolving stitches and healed within two weeks never a problem. This time my incision tore open twice in 3 different spots & had yeast infections. I had a fever for 2 days. I am 5 weeks postpartum still waiting for it to stop leaking and bleeding. I think this office has too many patients and it is too packed. I continued to have pre e after I delivered and felt like it wasn't being taken serious. Was sent back to the hospital a couple of times. It was so annoying I would go in for an appointment and be sent to triage. For other people
To deal with me and never dealing with my dr. At my last postpartum appointment he asked me who my insurance was & said yeah at this point since your blood pressure is still up we'll need you to start seeing your primary dr. & no I did not have state Insurance so I couldn't believe it. I do not recommend this place AT ALL. You seriously feel like all they want to do is collect on your insurance & I have talked to other people who went there & didn't have a good experience. Look elsewhere.",Beauty

First impressions and customer service influence my perception of a hotel.  I had a three night stay during mid-March after spending several nights on the Strip. It's about a 25-30 minute drive from the Strip on the interstate. It's not that difficult to get to from the Strip; on a return trip, coming out of the Aliante, you have to quickly get into the right lane to enter 251 West, drive several miles to I95 South and remain vigilant so you don't miss the I95 South interstate entrance ramp going back to the Strip. The property is gorgeous and resembles a miniature Red Rock Hotel and Casino. Registration is a distance from the casino and there is an assortment of restaurants and a food court near a large movie theater. There is ample parking.

Upon arriving to the hotel, three burly security guards watched me struggle with opening the large glass doors to registration, and did nothing to help. Approaching the registration desk, I was greeted with ""you checkin in?"" I reiterated my room request, ""King bed, no smoking on a high floor without a direct view of another building, parking garage, rooftops or heating and air conditioning units. I walked to my room continuing to notice how attractive the registration area, elevators and hallways were. The room was well decorated and beautiful. There was a large, fully tiled shower with glass doors and a boutique styled sink. There was no bathtub. There was a 42 inch plasma television, but unfortunately, numerous channels either pixilated or did not come in at all. 

The carpets, drapes and curtains appeared new and well maintained. I drew the drapes and curtain and, unfortunately, I had an excellent view of a roof top and a series of heating and air conditioning units. I immediately dialed the operator to reach the front desk.  A reservation agent answered and feebly attempted to placate me. She indicated that the hotel was sold out for the night, I could be moved to another room the next day and that all the rooms in this price point had a view of the rooftop and heating and air conditioning units (yes she said ALL). I refused to accept her explanation and asked to speak with the front desk. She placed me on hold for some ten minutes, returned and told me the front desk reiterated what she'd stated to me. After complaining that she did not connect me to the front desk, I asked to speak with a manager and waited about 15 minutes for her call. She gave me the same run around. Unbelievably, all the deluxe rooms reportedly have the same view. She was silent when I asked why this information is not contained on the website or when reservations are made. However, for an additional $10 per night, she would happily send someone to assist me with my luggage and relocate me to an upgraded room. (But I thought the hotel was sold out.) I told her it was a matter of principle and that I would remain in my current room.

The Medley Buffet is very reasonably priced.  It is a little more than an average buffet, but for the price, it is excellent. Customer service at the buffet was great!

The exercise room is located on the second floor and overlooks the pool, which is quite attractive. The exercise room was clean and had a very nice array of weight machines, bicycles, cross trainers and treadmills. Equipment was adequately spaced for safety and the room was not crowded.  Nothing was broken!

The casino is smoky and over my four day stay I found the slot machines somewhat tight. On a Friday, at about 6:30 pm, I did discover a Wheel of Fortune slot machine that was kind enough to allow me to play continuously for about 90 minutes racking up Players Card points until I finally lost my winnings and initial investment. It was worth it. Unfortunately, this is where I experienced some really bad drink service. For literally one hour, a cocktail server did not come by the slot machine bay. Others across the casino made eye contact with me as I attempted to ""wave to them"" to let them know I'd like to order drinks, but was ignored. I spoke to no fewer than four employees, supervisors, who passed by, asking them to send a server to our area. I spoke to one supervisor twice and she used her ""walkie-talkie"" to make someone aware to send a server to a specific slot machine. No one came.  Eventually, a business suited manager appeared who was ushering a server through the casino. Thankfully, they stopped by and I ordered drinks and continued to play the slot machine. Unfortunately, after 25 minutes of waiting, I called it a night and left.  

On Saturday, I went to the Bistro 57 Restaurant Bar to watch the NCAA Basketball tournament. The décor is very nice and inviting.  I ran a tab and stayed for some two hours, before leaving.  The customer service was efficient, but not friendly.

All in all, I really want to like this place; décor and amenities - excellent; customer service - zero.",Beauty
sasxqnU3MHAyBiqw-9-8Hw,-8EnCioUmDygAbsYZmTeRQ,2BuY5r2GWoai6IAn9FptCg,2015-06-11,"Huge facilities, I mean HUGE! Spa, salon and fitness center are all located seperatly. You have to check in at different front desks if you have different services. The spa front desk sent me upstairs to spa facility cause they thought my waxing was getting done over there, but the lady at the spa had to send me down cause my waxing was actually supposed to be done at the salon. So there goes my walking, I didn't even need to use the fitness center, I'd had enough exercise already! 

I did Brazilian wax including toosh for the first time, the room was very clean, she provided a wipe before the waxing. To the waxing technician's big surprise, I didn't feel a thing from Brazilian wax, not to mention I was a first timer! Well, I don't have much hair and my hair is really thin, guess that's the reason why it didn't hurt at all. And I had my half legs done too, not that I needed it, I don't have much hair on my legs either. She did a great job on my legs, but not Brazilian wax, she didn't tweeze all the baby hair off, or maybe they were just too soft to plug or something. Oh well... 

And I had gel Mani & Pedi, along with hydrating care. The ladies did great jobs on both my hands and feet, they have three lines of gel colors, so many bright summer colors to choose from. Both of the ladies were very thorough and gentle, super nice too, we did a lot of chatting while getting my nails done, they were fun! Loved my services at nail salon! 

The spa facility is definitely the largest and the best I have ever experienced! I loved the many co-ed areas, it was great that both hubby and I could enjoy quality times together, including huge common area, many treatment rooms and therapy pool. They have some snacks and basic refreshments throughout the facility, no food or alcohol unless you reserve one of those spa suites, they require treatments to use the spa suites and a certain fee each hour, minimum three hours. I highly recommend couples hang at the therapy pool for a while, it's overlooking liquid pool lounge, extremely quite and relaxing, definitely a great way to start a fun weekend or end a hard partying weekend. 

I LOVED the women spa, they have everything, ALL the amenities you need. Three jacuzzis in different temperatures, spacious sauna and steam room, also dressing rooms and lounge chairs. It's just one super nice facility to enjoy, relax and get ready for the evening! 

Hubby did a special massage with a petite woman stepping on his back, he said it was too painful for him, I told him to just stay with traditional massage in the future. We spent a good 5 or 6 hundred bucks on spa and salon services, minus the OK waxing service, I was very satisfied with everything else! Extremely polite and friendly staffs, a very pleasant spa experience indeed!

Just keep in mind that you don't need to spend a couple hundreds on services to get to enjoy the spa facility, just buy a $30 day pass, then you can spend a whole day there, that's really a great deal for how nice this facility is!

Ps. Be careful, you need to sign and tip on EACH service ticket, I over tipped cause I thought I'd just write down a total for all services, but they actually charge seperatly by each service ticket. So I had to sign the ticket I left out earlier in the end, and totally forgot I had already tipped more than enough! I think they really should specify on how guests signing and tipping the service tickets, it was very confusing! Also call in advance to ask them to wave the spa day pass if all your services are being done at the salon, cause you spend that much money already, you shouldn't have to pay for a spa day pass.",Beauty

Back in May for my junior prom, I found this shop and due to their outstanding reviews on yelp and facebook I decided to give them a try. I ordered an orchid corsage and boutonnière for my date & I. I had them delivered to my dates house so he could bring them when he picked me up that night. Unfortunately, When i opened the box I wasn't really blown away by my product. It was different seeing a slap bracelet used as the wristlet of the corsage, but to make the matters worse. The slap bracelet was placed the wrong way when it was made I spent all prom night upset and trying to improvise on how I can put on my corsage. After tearing the orchid from the bracelet I put it back together with safety pins. Due to my upsetting experience I emailed the woman who assisted me and attached a video of my corsage and how i was unable to wear it for my Junior Prom. She replied with an insincere email regarding the fact that they are sorry for the inconvenience and attached a video on how the bracelet should've worked. (As a junior in high school that's not the response i was seeking)... Moving on I forwarded the emails to my sister and she called the floral shop to speak to the woman who emailed me. After a long phone call the owner decided to give me a certificate for a free corsage. With the phone call my sister wasn't seeking any sort of discounts or free materials, but more of an apology that sounded somewhat considerate. Of course once the email was sent to me I was extremely thankful. 

Moving on to 6 months later, homecoming season. I however did not get asked to the dance, but my best friend agreed to be my date for the night. Due to my free certificate, I called and placed an order for another white orchid corsage. The employee on the phone stated that she would call me back the following morning to see if the wholesalers were able to deliver orchids. However the next day approached and I hadn't received a phone call, so I called and left a message briefly stating that I was never contacted back and that I was willing to accommodate and change my flower to whatever they have. Next day comes and they finally call back and said they don't have enough orchids for both a corsage and boutonnière. I finally agreed to using a white rose flower instead. Somehow the lady had asked me if i was the ""Alyssa"" that had the certificate. I replied that I was and that I would pick up my products at the end of the day today. 

After a completely busy day at school I drove to pick up the corsage and boutonnière. My heart sank when i saw the product. It was close to closing time and the owner was the one to present me my products. I had never felt so belittled to the service I had received. I'm one that tries to stay on the positive side and think that everything will be ok in the end, but for the corsage I received being the retail price that it was ($35), I had never been so disappointed. I didn't pick a fight since my corsage was free (apparently effort isn't needed when compensation is traded?) I was nice to the employees, and just drove to my local albertsons. The florist at the albertsons was a sub, but she was so nice to me. I had shown her the products I received and she said it's a complete and utter shame that those women that run that floral shop let me leave with those products. I also told her that I am a Senior in high school going to my last homecoming. Even that I am running for HC Queen. The lady, Miss Fran agreed to making me a new one. Other employees and parents who saw the difference between the corsages were stunned at the fact Naakiti was charging $35 and albertsons $16. within 15-20 minutes, Miss Fran had made me a new corsage with a beautifully bloomed rose. I had never been so thankful. I paid $16 for my corsage at albertsons. Although my experience was bad with Naakiti Floral Design (Decatur\/ Sunset). I advise all my friends and family to not approach Naakiti's business as it was such a shame on how I was treated. I'm glad that my experience came out ok in the end.",Shopping

It's hard to get around and tell where the food is. The plates come in two sizes: small and less small. Many dishes are on single serving dishes. Three fit on a plate. So I transferred my food over to my plate leaving behind the dish. I felt like a jerk leaving a stack of tiny dishes behind, but it's so hard to get through all the tables to my table that I wanted to minimize the amount of times I walked back and forth. The major con of this is my food got cold. My food got cold because the buffet is so busy that you have to wait at each station. It is true that many items were indeed mislabeled or not labeled at all. But the food was great! And the people that work there, despite being pushed to the limits of being busy, provided excellent customer service.

Now on to the food. 
Must have:
Both varieties of Mac & Cheese- it's sinful, oily, rich. One with crispy cheese on top. The other with crunchy bread crumbs.
Prime Rib with the Sauce- the meat was red and juicy. Make sure you eat the fat. Beware, I had to wait many minutes to get to this station.
Sliders- cooked to medium, oozing cheese. Looks like some were not as good as others though so choose wisely.
All the Dim Sum- I could eat a million sesame balls.
Flavored Honeys- Get a piece of bread (it's everywhere) and dip. The vanilla honey was the bees knees.

Overhyped:
Crab Legs- They are cut in half and still frozen. I don't know if it's just me, but every time I have them cut in half they taste way too salty. Try to find the claw pieces. At least they are sweet.
Shrimp and Grits- The grits seemed undercooked and flavorless. The flavor combo is more impressive on paper.

But the thing that really made my experience was the DESSERT section. No other place can compare. I should have eaten dessert all night. PHENOMENAL. It's far better in terms of variety AND quality than Studio B.
Macaroons in many flavors. Perfect, the way the outside caves in to a chewy mild flavor. I ate 3.
Gelato flavor like no one else. I had one scoop each of 3 flavors because it was offered to me (what a nice guy). The butter caramel is rich, but didn't compare to my other two flavors. Balsamic and Fig had chunks of sticky fig, harmonious. The best was the Aztec Chocolate. Spicy, chocolate, complex flavor that pleasantly lingers on the tongue.
Soufflé made fresh. It was still rising when she handed it me. You have to find the sign on top the bar and ask for it. I thank the kind stranger who guided me to it. The soufflé was hot and gooey inside with a subtle banana flavor.
Real marshmallows! Totally not obnoxious. They were light and sugary. I had a single pink one.
Some tiny cone filled with chocolate pudding? On a stick. Whoa, dunno what it was, but delicious. It tasted like they snuck a tiny bit of salt in it.
Three varieties of Crème Brulee: vanilla, chocolate, and hazelnut. I chose hazelnut. I couldn't taste the hazelnut, but the texture was spot on.",Restaurant
nz58EOmHz4eJIe8sFXjeLA,UjFMeqhGaY-lCevVKux2KQ,mU3vlAVzTxgmZUu6F4XixA,2017-01-16,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!

Yes yes, we all know it just opened and there are always kinks and training that need to be worked out but SHAME ON DAVID CHANG for NOT being at the restaurant opening week and working the f*cking line and making sure everything is perfect. 

Starting with the horrible hostesses that are more interested in chatting with each other than helping patiently waiting clients in line to the head chef walking around the restaurant chitchatting away, it was really a horrible experience. 

I work in the industry and have been to every DC restaurant from NYC to friggin Australia and this was by far the lamest and worst of his restaurant. 

There were 3 hostesses on duty and clearly they were hired for the length of their skirts vs making clients feel welcome and comfortable during the time of waiting for tables to clear. The worst part was that we waited over 30 minutes and there were a multitude of tables open in the restaurant. 

The ineptness and lack of communication between the wait staff and kitchen was so embarrassing and such a train wreck that you could clearly see the breakdown. There were so many hapless employees just standing around doing nothing while every single table in my vicinity had NO food on their tables. 

The ""managers"" and underlings were so basic in their attempts to appease customers that you would think this was an opening of a local deli down the street from your house.  All they did was make lame ass excuses for the delays instead of being honest and telling people that there were problems. You know what helps when those situation arise!?! You comp our drinks and food...you apologize and grovel at the customers. You don't lie and say the same damn thing over and over again. 

The head chef (bearded and tattooed...and so affected) was barely in the kitchen. All the chefs I know are sweating balls during service. This guy was so casual and just chilling by the bathrooms and walking around like he didn't have anything to do.  If there is a breakdown of food and\/or service, it starts with the head chef. They control the tempo and put the damn beat to the music. Without that, you have already failed. 

Okay...for the food. Clearly they are catering to the customers that haven't been to another DC restaurant. It's not the best of the best by any means, but it's the stuff that they can do with their eyes closed.  

Buns were good as expected. Ramen was whatever and broth was lacking density and porky saltiness. The clams lisboa and Bo Ssam were great. Pickle dish was good but any K-town place as better banchan. The spicy noodles and cold sesame noodles were stoner dormitory dishes that didn't add much.  The duck and Bo Ssam are not difficult dishes but take a lot of time and care. In NY, you have to order way in advance to get. They said the same thing for LV, but no one is ordering bc we ordered extra and they already had them in the kitchen. Btw...they made a point to tell us how long the cooking time was, but it's already a cooked dish and all the sides are prepped. We asking knowing this, why did it take 2+ hours to get to a damn table. What a joke!

Again with the service...not sure if they just expect every person to walk into the Las Vegas restaurant as hapless and ignorant, but the usual question for any multi chain restaurant is asking if you have dined with us before. It sets the pace, makes everyone feel special and also let's the server aware that yes, in fact you are familiar with the food and vibe.  That didn't happen..what happened is that everyone employee made you feel like you won a lottery ticket to gain entry and they were smug as sh*t about it. 

The ONLY and most important thing in today's restaurant world are repeat customers. That's the only thing that will sustain the business. Yes, Las Vegas is 99% tourist and one off customers but word will get out that the service and food are mediocre. 

It's 2017 and dozens of restaurants close down every day in every city. Don't ever get comfortable and let down the customers that are loyal, have gone to sister restaurants and intended to come back. David Chang seems not to care about that anymore and seems to have gone to the dark side of being a sell out and just another chef that just makes appearances on Top Chef.  

This isn't a fancy restaurant. It's not meant to be a 3 hour service with 45 min waits between courses. They won't make any money if they don't turn tables and they won't have repeat customers if everyone gets scared to come in because they don't have enough time to eat.  

I love the food but the service was so horribly disturbing that I wish I could give it ZERO stars. 

Still blows my mind that he wasn't there overseeing everything and how bad the service was...Breaks my foodie heart.",Restaurant
RaVwKxhvRfQ_rjHrZ0xZDw,xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,RAEY1h0WidFtpTm8eGhVHA,2016-06-08,"It had been a long time since I had tried a new brunch location so taking advantage of a recent beautiful spring day here in Montreal, my sister and I decided to go try a relatively new spot that I had heard good things about so far - Danny St Pierre's Petite Maison.

The long awaited Montreal project from Chef St Pierre is located in Mile End on Parc Avenue just north of St-Viateur. Its basement location is such that it is quite easy to walk by and miss it completely - we did as we were paying for parking! When you walk into the restaurant, the space is very clean and inviting. The use of white walls creates a much brighter space than you would expect from a basement. Simple decor accents and the stone foundation wall add some extra touches to the space. What is also not obvious when you enter is this room is not the whole space but simply the front of the house. A corridor brings you further back to the kitchen and another seating area. The divided rooms do create a more intimate feel though and help to reduce noise. Add some easy listening music and you have a nicely relaxed atmosphere for brunch.

Petite Maison's brunch setup is a fixed price menu - 24$ - which gets you a couple of entrees to share, your choice of a main dish and a couple of desserts to share again. A very reasonable price for the amount of food you get - I have not been that full after a brunch service in a very long time! A surprisingly good bang for your buck in that way. On top of the usual drink options, cocktails were available and I am never one to skip a good cocktail. I went with a Pimm's Lemonade - a light refreshing drink for a brunch.

Our first entree was duck rillettes served with onion confit, croutons, pickles and grain mustard. Fatty and rich texture as one would expect with duck. Strangely enough, the mix of the duck with the croutons and mustard - never pickles - created a very smoked meat-like flavour. The sweetness of the confit was a nice compliment to the rest of the dish.

Our second entree was a watercress salad with green apple and nuts. A nice light healthy salad. Nice balance of acid and sweet with a bit of crunch with the nuts. A solid compliment to the previously rich dish.

For a little extra, we also had the option of adding Chef St Pierre's unique ""Poutine Inversé"" - poutine in croquettes. Very nice crunch to the outside and yeah....the initial hit you get is truly of a poutine. A cool way to present a classic Quebec dish in a different fashion. 6 wasn't enough.... I could have eaten a basket of these babies!

As a main dish, my sister went with the eggs Benedict with asparagus and shrimp. Classic eggs perfectly executed - the hollandaise looked thick at first but was surprisingly light in consistency which was a very pleasant discovery. The one weird element was that the shrimp in the dish were served cold which was a little strange in comparaison to the temperature of the rest of the dish. Otherwise, a very satisfactory dish that filled up tremendously - my sister was unable to finish it due to being too full!

I ordered the pulled pork breakfast sandwich but through an error, I ended up with the fine herb omelette instead - not quite the same thing but the mistake was quickly resolved and we ended up with the extra dish on the house. The omelette, served with cream cheese and green onions folded in and some chicken fried potatoes on the side, was excellent. A soft pillowy texture but rich and flavourful. The combination of green onions and cream cheese added to the richness and brought some creaminess and sharpness. The potatoes were solid as well.

The pulled pork sandwich came right after. Usually served with potatoes, we skipped that since they had come with the omelette. The savoury shredded pork was served over a hamburger bun with shredded cheese, arugula and a sunny side up egg. I loved the flavour of the pork. The egg made it pretty much impossible to eat as a sandwich without making a huge mess so I went open face instead. The one negative was the bun - just a un-toasted white bread hamburger bun. Given the quality of the rest of the meal, I expected something more. It was fine but just odd relative to everything else.

Despite having pretty much no appetite anymore, we still had dessert to try. First was churros served with caramel sauce. Not served as hot you would expect but the texture was nice. The caramel sauce's flavour was too burnt with my sister and I. The other dessert was the chocolate hazelnut torta. Also served cold, this cake was much denser than I expected but deliciously rich. Whole hazelnuts inside the sorta brought some crunch and really helped create that natural nutella flavour we all love.

Petite Maison was a nice experience to try out - a worthy addition to Mile End. Other than the mistake on the order which they dealt with very smoothly, service was quick and attentive. The food, other than a few little issues, was on point and showed a nice level of technical prowess",Restaurant

I walked into shane co for the first time in August of 2014 with my girlfriend. We were greeting and asked if we needed help finding anything by 3 or 4 different people. We gave them the typical ""were just looking, thank you"" answer as we had been to a few other jewelry stores and didn't want to feel pressured again. (Tip to other jewelry stores, I'm not going to buy a ring right in front of my girlfriend, the whole idea was a surprise. Just because we were looking didn't mean I wanted her to know when it was going to happen) so after browsing for a good 20-30 minutes, we realized the selection and prices here were by far cheaper, for better quality, than the other stores we had looked at. 

Once we realized the quality of what we were looking at, we finally decided to talk with someone. Enter Leon. He was very friendly but I still assumed we were going to get the samw pressure as other stores, but this was not the case. There was no pressure to buy. He asked some questions, ""how long have you been together"", typical things the jeweler asked you. What surprised me was the fact that he spent over an hour and half with us, pulling different rings, different diamonds, anything we could want to see, leaving multiple rings and diamonds out so we could compare side by side as opposed to looking at one, putting it back in the case, pulling another like we saw at other stores. Finally after almost 2 hours I finally had a general idea of what my girlfriend would like. 

About three to four weeks later, I entered shane co on my own, confident in what I was doing. Leon saw me as I walked in the door, stopped what he was doing and said ""Travis! Good to see you again"" the personalization was unlike anything I could have expected. He helped me look at rings again until I found the perfect one. Because I wasn't sure exactly when I wanted to ""pop the question"" Leon recommended that I use there lay a way program. You can put a ring on lay a way for up to 1 year, making monthly payments, with no interest. And if you ever wanted to cancel you would get all of the money back. 

About a month later I went in to pick out a diamond. Leon was there again and greeted me right away. After an hour of questions about diamonds, I thought I had finally found the perfect diamond for her. The process to add it to my layaway program was quick and easy. Over the next 4-5 months I would go in and make my payment (you can make a payment over the phone, but I preferred to use cash in case she looked at the bank statements) every time I was there I would ask to see the diamond placed in the ring again as I wanted to make sure it was perfect. In February I decided to take one more look at diamonds as I knew I was getting close to when I wanted to ask. Leon spent another hour and half with me until I decided I wanted to switch from a cushion cut, to a radiant diamond. The process to change it on my layaway plan was quick and easy. And I was out the door. 

On may 27th I walked into the store ready to pay it off. I was planning to ask my girlfriend to marry me on June 6th. Made the payment and they said the ring would be ready by Friday. I ended up going in on the next Monday, June 1st, and realized I didn't let them know I wanted them to set the diamond real low (it's a double halo ring and wanted it tiered for three layers) they set it in the typical higher fashion like many other rings, immediately I started to panick, not that it didn't look great, but I knew it wouldn't be the way she wanted it. I told them I was looking to ask this week, the assured me it was no problem, that they would put a rush order on it and could lower the setting and it would be ready that same night!  It ended up being perfect. 

To say that I had a great experience at shane co would be an understatement. For one person. To easily spend 15-20 hours with me over the course of me changing 
my mind and I didn't get the hint he was ever annoyed, or wanted to do something else, was fantastic. He could see how excited I was every time I was there, and he took his time with me and shared my enjoyment. THANK YOU TO LEON AND EVERYONE ELSE AT SHANE CO!  You made the experience better than I could have imagined and she loved her ring!",Shopping

We went on the second night it was open and was seated promptly in the backroom where the fireplace and faux oil paintings are hanging on the ceiling. The ambiance is lively and spacious in the main room with the exposed kitchen, bar with numerous flat panel tvs and lounge area with large red comfy looking chairs. The backroom where we were seated was of a quieter ambiance. The service was excellent, with various staff including the the owner coming by to check on everything. They were very friendly and attentive; not sure if it was due to recently opening, but hope it continues. 

Now onto the good stuff... 

Drinks: Great draft selection (15 or so on tap), they have Goose Island Pere Jacques on tap!!! Very well done my friends, well done!! 
Great selection of martinis, including various fruity and herb infused flavors. Plus ""Adult Milkshakes""! (Get your mind outta da gutter) Didn't get one, but they sounded tasty. (Nutella: Vanilla ice cream, Nutella, Frangelico and Hazelnuts; sounds almost sinful to put Nutella and alcohol together) 

Food: Pat La Frieda burgers here in Cleveland?!?!?! Yes you heard right! Sourced from KY and previously exclusively sold in NYC is available in Cleveland. Same purveyors who make the ""Black Label"" burger for $26 seen on ""No Reservations"". Anyhow I got the ""California Dreamin'"" Burger ($7.90, gotta represent my home state). It has watercress, avocado relish, jack cheese and tomato. Delicious! Juicy, cooked to perfection and fresh ingredients. The side of hand-cut fries with ""malt mayo"" had just the right amount of kick and flavor. 
My companion got the Marinated Amish Roasted Half Chicken ($13.90!). They aren't kidding with it being a Half Chicken. Definitely a large portion cooked to perfection! Juicy on the inside with crispy skin on the outside. The herb mashed potatoes are awesome! I love my potatoes to have some punch, and these had great intensity of flavor of garlic and various herbs. 

I look forward to heading back to try other tasty options. All the entrees are below $22!! $5.90 for a burger! I consider this a bargain if the rest of the menu is as good as the food we got. Other tasty sounding options: Ribeye, Scallops, Steak and Eggs, Ribs, fresh daily fish, brussel sprouts with hazelnut and pomegranate (interesting!). Sounds like they will have a nice large patio opening for the summer. They also have some great happy hour deals, daily drink specials and have late night food items as well. I look forward to going back!",Restaurant
EobVa9ja9D56CfoYJNgmpw,oFyOUOeGTRZhFPF9uTqrTQ,wEGVBX6dg-htABZPg3Eabw,2016-12-06,"There were unfortunately many bumps in the road for my friend and I yesterday at our appointments. I booked their special, my friend had a pedicure done and we were beyond excited to try out this new spot. That excitement faded as the HOURS passed that we were there due to my nail tech, Cindy, and I only know her name because the receptionist told me at the end. 
The first issue was that our appointments were not booked in their system after I confirmed they were days before. This got us started about 20minutes late as is. Then my nail tech decided her phone was more important than the services I was paying for ($55 for gel manicure). She verbally told me ""hold on"" as she sat back to continue texting. Her phone was glued to her the entire time as she tried to make phone calls and took them as well as sent texts. No wonder our appointments took hours. As she was doing my nails I asked for them to be evened out since they were very uneven and tried to explain what I was seeing. Maybe I was not explaining it the best and I even held up my hand as I have experienced other technicians do as I have gotten my nails done in the past to compare length\/shape so they are even. To be met with a rude remark that left me feeling talked down to I was emotionally done with this experience. I wanted to get out of there as soon as I possibly could, I was very frustrated. 
She did a less than desirable job with my manicure and pedicure. My feet are still rough and have dead skin, it would have been nice to get a thorough pedicure that leave my feet feeling soft and refreshed.... and for the manicure, the gel is uneven and even missing on some parts of the sides of my nails! When she was finishing up she asked me to ""feel my nails"" because they were rough on the top, then asked if that was ok. I get similar polish every time I get my nails done. I have not once ever felt them to be ""rough"" when they were finished. Again I was disappointed and replied with a ""not really, but I'm running late to another appointment"". She told me she would put more top coats on after seeing my friend call to let the next place know what was going on and hearing that I was already late to another appointment due to her phone interruptions. I just asked if I could just come back after my next appointment to have them fixed. I was really hoping I would be able to just sit with another technician to complete the task when I came back. Lucky enough I was! 
My friend was disappointed with her service but not necessarily the technician. She felt what she paid was on the high side for the services provided. She expressed to me that in the past when she has paid that price the pedicure had included longer massages, hot stones, etc. at different salons. I think it left her feeling a bit bummed out to pay that amount and not be met with the level\/value of service that she has experienced many other places. 
The technician sitting next to Cindy's station, who had been so pleasant the entire time, took care of fixing the top coat issues for me when I had to come back to fix them. And she was soooooo FAST but meticulous with fixing the top coat! She has great customer service and went out of her way to chat with me before her next client came in and made me feel very comfortable even though I wasn't her client. I wish I would have been placed with her, I feel it would have been a very different experience. 
I have never seen such a lack in professionalism from any nail technician I have encountered out here in Vegas, and hope not to run into this again. 
I certainly would not come back for any services with Cindy. I am still undecided if I would give it another try with someone else here. 
The receptionists that checked us in were so friendly and helpful, it was not her fault the appointments slipped through the cracks. The second nail technician who helped me was fabulous and really quite pleasant. However the technicians my friend and I were assigned to left us feeling frustrated, quite the opposite of what the goal was for our girls day on our day off. And upon my arrival home and showing them off to my fiancé I realized parts of my nails are left showing and were not even painted fully. There is even a spot on one of my thumbs that she did not take off the old gel and you can see that color instead of the color she applied today. I really wanted to like this salon because it's truly beautiful and some of their staff really rock it!",Beauty
w_HLGaCoP3fR9UP3dXuN5Q,chgTnp84tlV4UUJlfIVJzA,LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA,2015-09-09,"What can I say about Guru Lukshmi... For sure it's an experience in itself. We walked into this whole production unexpectedly and it was really cool - although probably cool for us since we were out of town on vacation. I don't know how others deal with it on a regular basis. :)

So I was randomly yelping Indian restaurants in Mississauga, since we were visiting Toronto. Everyone's heard of the Indian crowds there. I ran across GL and we decided to drop by for dinner. It was a bit of a hike from the city, but we get there like... 9:10pm and noticed some CRAZINESS! :) There were people out the door jam packed! Talk to the guy, and he's like there's a 1.5 hour wait. Nuts... never experienced that at an Indian restaurant.

The kids were hungry, so we put our name down and actually took the kids to Taco Bell. :-) I know... it's big in America. Hadn't had it on the entire trip, and the kids jumped up like they saw Santa when I mentioned there was one like 5 miles away. Can you imagine? A dinner adventure before dinner?

So then we get back and it's still like 30 minutes to go. We were chit chatting with the host and all and some of the other seated guests - recon before the big showdown... Found out they not only do dosas, but they have innovative kinds of dosas. Like, Pao Bhaji Dosa, Khaara Dosa, etc. The menu had probably like 40 different kinds of dosas. We're reading the articles about this place and how many times they've had to expand and they still have 1.5 hour waits.

We finally get seated and then it hits you. Service. Indian restaurants can be as popular as the Backstreet Boys, but Indian service is going to remain Indian service. There was a bunch of confusion and miss-steps throughout the experience. They don't seem to have assigned waiters for the tables, so we had numerous people stopping by with updates, questions, etc. One person was like, the waitress couldn't ""get"" the order so he came to confirm it. One lady said they were out of Mango Lassi for the night and then 3 minutes later they brought us some. The guy was like, they were just making more. I could go on and on with these things, but really, the star of GL is the food, so I will move on.

Idli Sambhar - Loved them. Comes with coconut and this spicy chutney. Sambhar was good and the idlis were just the right texture. Not too hard and not too squishy either. Great start.

Onion Rava Masala Dosa - what was better about this than other places was that it was very thin and crispy. Thinner than most places I've had it. I had the masala on the and it was just a great dosa. The dosas all came with the coconut and spicy chutney, and also this green minty one. I like the first two most.

Butter Masala Dosa - I didn't have this one, but it looked great. Those that were eating it enjoyed it.

Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa - So I tasted this one and it was very unique. Basically, they had mixed in some Pau Bhaji masala into the Mysore Masala, so it was a mixture of those of those flavors. Very interesting. Personally, I would stick to the basics, especially when trying a new place. I'm glad someone else ordered this one and I got to taste it. Overall, very crispy, flavorful, and good.

Badam Halwa - I really liked it. Others I was with said it was too sweet - more sugar than the norm, but I thought it was great. It comes in a really small portion, probably because it's quite rich, and very good.

As I mentioned, Guru Lukshmi was an interesting experience. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed our evening with as many adventures as it had. Best dosa in North America? Well, better than other ones I've had in North America. Actually, with some of the variety, it may be the ONLY place where you can get some of these dosas at all. Definitely recommend GL for someone in the area. Oh, and supposedly they take reservations so definitely call ahead.",Restaurant

One of my high school classmates checked into this place and captioned it with, ""Hawaiian Style Chinese food."" From that point on, I was sold. It wasn't too far from my house and my body was telling me it was time to eat. As I researched this place on my Yelp app, I realized that this place sold cake noodles, a dish reminiscent of my childhood days. Boy was I excited.

This place is located on the corner of  Desert Inn and Sandhill, which means from the 95, you'll have to take Flamingo or the Boulder cutoff and travel down Sandhill. This restaurant sits in a shopping center full of mediocre businesses, not too exciting of a location. When you enter, you think very outdated. Booths and round tables with lazy Susans tell you this place needs a renovation and fast! What calmed my initial nerves was the fact that they do their best to hold the Chinese traditions AND seem to cater to the Hawaiian population. Hawaiian drinks, signs with ""Aloha"" and ""Mahalo"" display their windows and counters. Did I really hit the jackpot?? When talking with the employees, the young lady said her uncle has a Wo Fat restaurant in Honolulu and this is another location. The staff was super nice. Even though I ordered my food to go, she still offered water to me. The food also came very quickly. Speaking of which, here's what I got:

Crispy Gau Chee Mein with cake noodles for around $10: THE REASON that brought me here and the reason that will keep me coming back! As a base you have the delicious cake noodles that remind me of my childhood. Crispy noodles cut into cake squares, topped with Gau Chee, oyster sauce and lots of different flavors and textures: char siu pork, shrimp, chicken, broccoli, Chinese peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms. WOW, what an array of flavors! So delicious and something I highly recommend! The cake noodle managed to maintain is crispiness, even with the oyster sauce. I was in heaven.

Kow Yok for $9.25: Kind of weird that they spell it like this. In Hawaii, it's referred to as Kau Yuk. Whatever the spelling, it's basically pork belly cooked and flavored with a fermented red bean curd. PLEASE BE ADVISED, this is a super marbleized dish. The fat can be very over powering for many, so don't order it if you're not into that. For me, it's what I grew up with! The flavor was just right. The pork had a good combination of fat\/meat ratio. 

Crispy Gau Chee order (6) for $6.25: Another form of spelling I'm not used to. In Hawaii it's Cripsy Gau Gee. Basically pork stuffed won ton rectangles and deep fried, served with a spicy mustard and soy dipping sauce. This was ON POINT! Perfectly cook, super crispy and the port was flavored well. Add in the mustard sauce and you've got a side dish fit for a king! You definitely have to try this if you come!

Oyster Chicken for $8.95: Roasted chicken topped with an oyster flavored sauce. I thought the sauce was great and really helped to enhance this dish. My only gripe about this dish was the cut of chicken. It's Chinese style and cut like a roasted duck dish, meaning the cut bones and all. Although this is a Chinese restaurant, I don't necessarily think it's a Hawaiian style dish. What I'm used to is boneless, breaded and fried chicken with the oyster sauce drizzle. The flavor was good, but for some reason I wasn't as crazy about this dish as I was about the others. 

FINALLY! A Chinese restaurant that reminds me of home! There are a lot of Chinese joints in Las Vegas, none like this. The cake noodles alone are reason to come back. Add the crispy gau chee and I've officially found my new favorite joint! On my next visit, I'm getting the cold ginger chicken. I can't wait for that day to come. Thanks so much for the awesome food!",Restaurant
ExjQAq5fTn1u07Dsgqf1aw,fCtsJ5pIzyXDGz6Zgb9_mQ,0aC1_rN0scdHkAy_dDSMWA,2014-09-11,"I ordered through GrubHub, and have never used this restaurant before so I thought I'd give them a try. The reviews state that the prices are on the high end, but I figured that maybe the quality would justify the price. Unfortunately, I figured incorrectly. 
$17.54 for a Whole ""Supreme Italian Gourmet Hoagie"" and a 2lt Mt. Dew. Delivery time was acceptable - the delivery Mom showed up exactly 45 minutes after placing the order - the restaurant is located 3.9mi from my house, so I was ok with that... it's normal for delivery to take that long from anywhere in the area. 

My sandwich arrived warm. It wasn't hot, but it wasn't frozen either. I'm not sure which part of the grinder was ""supreme"" or ""gourmet"" as neither the two minuscule pieces of sausage (I'm talking about 2 pieces per half that were rougly the size of #2 pencil erasers nor the 4 shreds of cheese that were buried in the crotch of the bread (by shreds, I mean those 1.25"" long shreds that are used to cover pizzas impressed me very much. As for the toppings, I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that the days-old lettuce was dropped onto the grinder before it was placed in the toaster because it was limp, tasteless, and off-color. The thin tomato slices were barely orange (not even close to red) and had a bitter unripened flavor. The banana pepper pieces were of low quality - were poorly sliced, included too much endocarp - or whatever that internal ridging is, were hard (I had to spit out one because its consistency was similar to a solid slice of stem). The deli-sliced meats were fine. Not great. Not terrible. They were neither supreme nor gourmet, just fine - about the same quality I would expect from a gas station. The hoagie roll was disappointing to say the least.It was unevenly toasted, some sections were so chewy that I had to remove them from the surrounding bread with my fingers as they couldn't be chewed (and I suspect couldn't be digested). Being generous and honest here, almost 1\/3 of the bun was gooey and soggy despite the pink dressing being served in a container on the side. I'm not talking damp or a bit greasy... I'm talking straight-up mush that oozed through my fingers and eventually separated itself from the rest of the roll and splattered on my plate - sending a shower of spittle everywhere.

Now, for the best part... the 2-liter of Mountain Dew? It was handed to me covered in what could best be described as dried vomit laced in 12"" long brown hairs with some kitty litter intermingled for color. As I took it from the delivery Mom, I asked what it was and she said that I'd ordered it, to which I replied that I hadn't ordered it covered in what appeared to be vomit. She claimed that she didn't know what it was covered in and that ""he had just put it in her car."" She offered no further explanation and she made a 1\/4-hearted (not even half) attempt to smear the puke making a two-finger window revealing the label.

Now, you might think that this is an exaggeration and that I'm just upset with my order. Much to the contrary... I gave this restaurant 2 stars because: for a low-quality, over-priced pizza joint with average delivery time, a pleasant delivery Mom, unspeakable soda coverings, toppings that even Subway wouldn't server, and gooey bread - the delivery Mom had a little kid in her backseat that was terrified of a raccoon that she saw near my door. Without the little girl's face and reaction to this raccoon (which I didn't see, but I believe it was there based on the look on her face), this restaurant would have received only 1 star. This review is fair and unbiased.",Restaurant
z5ZkOha9meUsU0Ab2DsPKg,n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,98UNr2GnZvHjUHy-xb_G_A,2017-03-02,"I am currently working on my first tattoo, a sleeve, with Vic Vivid. Everything so far has been wonderful. 

I've been wanting tattoos for a long time, but held off until I had a career that allowed it, the money for actual art and wasn't a stupid kid getting impulsive bullshit. I did my research and got to emailing. The problem with going for a lot of prestigious tattooers is they're too busy for customer service and need someone to do that yet many don't have someone manning their appointments. Many of my emails have still gone unanswered. I originally was doing a different subject on my leg, bit found that what I want for a sleeve fits the style of art Vic Vivid does.  

 I get a response within the day from his shop manager, Nick. We email back and forth and by the end of the day I have a consultation that weekend. I loved the shop - it's beautiful dark walls, gold gilded baroque, chandeliers... It's one of the prettiest shops. It's very clean, and the vibe was just good about it. One thing I like is that while it is open, it's spacious so there's not this feeling that everyone is just so close to each other. I like that there's some feeling of comfort by giving people moving room. 

Vics really cool and seemed to like my project which I think makes for a better tattoo when they like what they're doing. It felt right so I put in for an appointment and left a deposit. He seems to be booked at least 6 months out so not years to get in, but still a wait. Usually his Instagram (@vicvivid) will let you know what month is currently open to book. His rate is not cheap, but also not the highest I've heard, either way you get what you pay for. Stop getting cheap shitty tattoos and having to laser and cover later! I did my research  on tattoo communities and people there were confident I'd be happy with the end result, he has a good reputation for solid work. I even found former clients online and saw their healed tattoos- they look amazing! 

I was so nervous for my first appointment. He first got a picture of my arm and started playing on the computer with some references and putting it on the arm to get an idea of what were doing. Then he made the stencil, we looked at how it sat on my arm and got to doing a colored outline. He specializes in photo realism so there's no black out lines so I have a color outline on my arm. He does both black and grey and color realism but the way he does color I think sets him apart. The saturation and color choices are striking! 

All the other guys at the shop were also super cool. They came over to see what was going on and were friendly and made me feel better about my nervousness. I would most definitely recommend them too as they have talent and are good people. They were giving each other a hard time and their banter was keeping me entertained. It's a positive environment and seems like they're a team here. 

You're going to spend so much time with your artist and at the shop that a good vibe and liking the people there I think is important. Talent only goes so far... I wouldn't want to sit where I didn't feel good about. I've been to a few that made me feel I should walk back out.  I didn't sit with my stepdad at his last tattoo because the artist was hella scummy. 

I cannot wait to get this project finished! I'm going to have a beautiful arm. It's a long process, but I know I'm in good hands here.  Will update after all my appointments are done, but this is everything I would want out of a first time experience! I really like this spot I am thinking I might just stick to here for my other arm too. 

If you're looking for a place to do larger unique pieces this is a great shop to go to. Vic Vivid, Noelin Wheeler, Christian Buckingham and Dwight Bulb will be able to give you something you're absolutely in love with!",Beauty
7YJ_WVWn6GAN92mLOu9JQA,jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,2012-11-26,"Really wanted something different and fabulous from the recent steak places that I'd been to and didn't want Italian so found RM and was super impressed.

Walked in and was seated quickly in a large, but cozy dining room in a corner (which I love) and greeted almost immediately with water and the waiter. Really nice immediate service. Bonus points for that.

I ordered a Chimay (wow, Mandalay Bay, that all your restaurants carry my favorite beer means I'll always make you my first in dining choices!) and my friend ordered a fabulous martini. He asked for extra olives and the waiter not only brought out regular olives (pimento center), but also blue cheese stuffed olives. It's those little touches that make a place worth returning to. 

So, forget everything else, but listen to this: if you want the best, very best, best-I've-ever-tasted oysters, come here. I am an oyster lover. I am quite certain I could subsist on oysters. But only if they come from RM. I have never, ever in my life, ever had oysters this fantastic. Blown. Away.

I ordered six ($23). You THINK that's a high price to pay, but you are confused. It is just the right amount to pay for the best tasting oysters in THE WORLD. The six types of oysters were Kusshi, BC, New Sound Select, WA, Miyagi, BC, Stoney Neck, NY, Moonstone, Ct and Village Baby, NB. The ONLY one I disliked was the Miyagi. It was small and had a very bitter, unpleasant taste. The rest? Prepare to cry. I can't even pick my favorite out of all of them. I'd eat one and say 'oh, THIS is my favorite' until I picked up the next one. Wow. If you love oysters you will LOVE these. Wow. I can't stop saying that. Wow.

I then asked the waiter about the Maine lobster roll. He informed me that it was lunch item, but what almost sure they could make it for dinner. And boy did they. I should have come here at lunch because the portion was way too big to eat! Not only that, but it was chunky and full of lobster. They went heavy on the dill and mayo, which I disliked intensely, but biting into large pieces of lobster calmed that down. 

My friend had the charred octopus and declared it much too much for one person (and then proceeded to chow it down). He loved it and finished every bit. It looked seriously delicious and that was confirmed. He then had the jumbo lump crab cakes as an entree and that was rather large as well. He declared them perfect. 

We also got bread service. Let me tell you that if you don't like the corn bread muffins you go ahead and save those and I'll send you my address; you can just ship those straight to me. Yum-my. 

The restaurant was very low key, clean and beautiful. My friend said he disliked that the tables didn't have table cloths (elitist), but I thought it was a very sort of 'seafaring' touch. I don't know, but you should seriously try this restaurant. It's moderately priced with really good food. Loved it!",Restaurant
MlNaiF3UosAS-BZPO-ez2w,EC5TGpxONfz4IZIjML0DpQ,e41TP5cXZqSrz50xCBJqZw,2011-09-12,"Quick Note: This Review is more like a 4.5 than just a 4. However as you already know, Yelp does not do half points. 

Alright, let's get cracking! I have been coming to this place for at least 12 years and during the Summer back in '06, this was one of 'Mauricio's Certified Watering Holes.'  Which I haven't had many of... although, I guess you might get diverging answers whether you were to ask my friends or my liver.  Either way I digress, this place is a lot of fun, specifically if you come at night. 

If you are looking for a chilled-beat-DJ'ed, slick and well alcohol stocked  lounge in the Annex, then without doubt Insomnia is the place to go. If you have a hot date, and you want to take her (or him) to a place that gives the impression you are in the know, then you can't go wrong taking them here. However, if your date is during the day or early, early evening, then avoid Insomnia like the crippling chronic condition it is named after. 

During the day, Insomnia has a very cold and bare feel to it. The furniture is modern, unfortunately the wooden tables really seem washed out in this decor-combo but not as much as the floor which bares the weathered battle scars of servicing customers day in and day out for over a decade. The exposed brick walls lack personality in sunlight, even as the lonely looking art (from some unknown artists) try their best to decorate but are more likely just hoping to be noticed by an art lover and be purchased out of this generally empty place. As during the day, Insomnia feels more like a pretentious cave-like café than a lounge.   

The menu is your typical Mediterranean\/Fusion standard with some Humus\/Salads\/Calamari\/Pizza\/Pasta dishes. Honestly, I barely eat here as their selection although reasonably priced does not inspire me to order anything. Their brunch however brings quite a crowd each and every weekend with line-ups forming up outside at around 11:00ish. I have gone for their brunch a few times and although it was better than expected, it can get quite loud so it does not serve well for a quiet or romantic experience.

Quick note: As with most places in the Annex, their bathroom is located in the basement so it is not handicap friendly 

Now where Insomnia really does shine is in its night-life. Their bar is well stocked and up to a few years ago it was one of the few lounges that carried a decent selection of say, grappa or different price points for vodka and single or blended scotches. They carry a reasonable martini and wine lists and some good selections of beers and ciders both on tap and by the bottle; plus a few liquors you normally do not find in your average lounge like Tequila Rose or Amarula.

The actual bar is lit from above by white Christmas lights creating a very vague simile of a night sky. There are tea-lights everywhere, giving the locale a sensual vibe which the shiny wooden accents from the furniture accentuate even further. In this light, the exposed brick walls exude a sophisticated loft aesthetic excellent for socializing and mingling. Insomnia is a like a chameleon. 

I sometimes used to come here after a party for a nightcap and I generally and easily made new friends just by seating at the bar.   

The staff was and is always friendly and if you have large groups the back has couches which can fit about 10 people. Although as I said before, Insomnia is more of date\/small group (4 max.)  locale as it might be too loud for a group of 10 to hear each other or to mingle properly. 

This is a great place for small groups of friends to spend a Friday\/Saturday night or to bring a date for a few drinks and some fun conversation. 

Fun Fact:  Whether they are ripping them off or trying to benefit by jumping on the mental condition bandwagon, guess what the Bar & Grill across the street from Insomnia is called? Ready for it?

I sat on the end so I got to see the waiters serve wine, prepare someone's lobster from shell to plate, refill Voss sparkling and still water, etc...
Amuse: cheese puffs...nothing special.
Cocktail: can't remember the name, but it was citron, sweet n sour, limoncello and amaretto..with a cinnamon-rimmed glass...soo good
Wine: Bottle of red, yummy- not sure what is was because it was picked out before I arrived, went well with beef of course
Breads: Choice of pretzel, onion focaccia, pumpernickel, and sourdough. I went with pretzel - very soft and yummy, but not warm.
Appetizer: Tuna Tartare...super delicious reddest tuna I have seen, covered in beautiful avocado slices and masago, with 4 corners of plate covered with baby sliced radishes and cucumbers, ginger, wasabi, and kaiware sprouts + togarashi toasts
Entree: The disappointment of the evening.  I ordered the 8-hour slow-cooked kobe beef short ribs ""Indian style"" - served on pureed mint ""raita"" and corn puree.  The curry sauce was wayyyyy too strong...ruined the meat flavor and made it hard to stomach.  The meat was cooked well but really, I could barely touch it.  I know it is a steakhouse so I probably should have gotten a steak, but my stomach didn't agree with that idea so I went with something easier to chew :)
Sides: I picked out the wild mushrooms and shisito peppers which I thought were amazing.  I also really liked the cavatappi mac n cheese, and the tempura onion rings.  Didn't try the fries.  The sauteed spinach and polenta were tasteless.
Dessert: Ice cream sandwich with cherry coke float (I only tried the float) and bruleed banana cream pie (I had some banana with chocolate caviar crisp things, that much of it was tasty).
The servers brought out more little rectangular bars that I had no room for, but one was ""upscale Snickers,"" key lime pie, and chocolate fudge.
Service: Very thorough.  Intimidating when sides came out as each side had a waiter bombarding each person at the table with ""Do you want some of this?""  Water was refilled ASAP, and all of the servers knew who had sparkling and who had still.  When cocktails were finished, the glasses were removed quickly.  Servers were friendly, information on each steak was provided before we ordered, and the waiters made sure we knew what sides were ordered when it was our turn so we could get something else for the table.
Other: The other person who ordered short ribs didn't like them either.  The lady who ordered lobster said it took so long for the server to take it from shell to plate that it was very cold.  Also, they delivered 4 types of mustard and did not explain who or what they were for, but charged for other sauces.
Summary: I would return as everything but my entree was flavorful and the service was decent.  The drinks were great too.  I would probably work out for 8 hours and fast so I could fit a steak in, but at least my kobe was tender - if it was just in the mint and corn purees and without the curry I bet it would have been simple and fantastic.",Restaurant
TwmsMuqxYGyhAn5Di3m-bA,Og_PyrLavoiWLWNlwq5h9A,WYw3Uf56DT5IwpaLNnCH5Q,2014-10-31,"We made our first and last visit to Vdara (10\/19 - 10\/27), We booked 8 nights in the Penthouse Suite and arrived Sunday, October 19 at approximately 11 a.m. When we arrived at the hotel we were directed to go to the front desk to pre-register, and were not invited to go to a priority check-in, which meant we had to wait in a very long line as people were checking out at this time as well. This seemed odd for a penthouse booking as we expected to be given a priority in check-in at the very least and we have seen other reviewers who had the two-bedroom Penthouse and they were offered priority check in, upgraded rooms with views of Bellagio lake, etc. We were offered none of that even though we had requested it months in advance. When we finally got up to the desk to pre-register we were told that the room was not ready, but that we could go ahead and check in and they would call us as soon as the room was ready which they expected to be within about two hours.
So we went to find a place for lunch. By the time we finished lunch it was about 2:00 and we had expected to hear something by then, but we did not, so we called to see if the room was ready. We could not get an answer as to whether or not the room was ready and all that they could tell us is that someone from housekeeping would be tracked down and we would receive a call back as soon as they could get a status. Over 30 minutes passed, so now it was 2:30, and we still had not gotten even a call back to update us as to the status of the room. We called twice between 2:30 and 3:00 from the lobby and were told the same thing, that no one from housekeeping could be reached and that the room was still not ready. We sat in the lobby watching other people check in, go to their rooms and come back down and leave, all the while we sat waiting with no answers and no one trying to resolve the problem. No remedies were offered at all...we were just left in limbo sitting in the lobby.
Finally, at 3:15 out of desperation we got back in the check-in line, waited for another 15 minutes in line, and then when we finally got up to the desk and stated that we had been waiting and that it was now past check-in time, the lady got on the phone trying to get someone from housekeeping to get a status. She told us no one was answering and then she left the counter and said she'd be right back. We have no idea where she went, but she was gone for a long period of time, and finally at somewhere between 3:30 and 3:45 while we were still standing at the counter waiting for her to come back and tell us what was happening, our phone rang and it was housekeeping saying that the room was finally ready, at which point the lady at the desk reappeared. All this time nothing was offered to us, like some complimentary coffee at Starbucks, a couple of drinks in the Vdara bar while we waited, Nothing! This was a completely unacceptable course of events.
The people working the front desk have a very snobbish attitude and really don't seem to care about guests. Most of them don't appear to be experienced enough to work in a luxury hotel.
Why weren't we ever upgraded to a strip view especially when we were not even put in our room until well past check in time? Why didn't anyone take control of the situation and try to resolve it? Why not have us sit and wait in the Vdara Bar having cocktails and snacks to make it an enjoyable experience?
By the time we got to the room and had our luggage brought up, it was well past 4:00. When we finally got to the room it did not have a view of the strip as we had requested. Basically we were looking at and hearing the highway. We could not believe it as we paid for an eight night stay at a Premium 5-Star Hotel Penthouse Suite and spent a significant amount of money to stay in this Penthouse Suite. We have received better accommodations and service at much lower priced hotels in Las Vegas, such as The Signature where we actually had a strip view and a balcony, and were also accommodated on an early check-in with no problems within a reasonable amount of time of arriving. We had to call three days in a row asking for coffee and water, as we were only provided the bare minimum of water and decaffeinated coffee instead of regular coffee. The first time we asked for coffee we were told that there were only three regular caffeinated Keurig coffees left, so we were given the last three. Wow, running out of regular coffee?
They also will bring you an arrival gift - Ours was a bowl with four tiny pieces of rotten fruit versus the Signature, where our gift was a large basket of fruit and a bottle of champagne.
We observed housekeeping cleaning rooms as late as 5:00 pm, when the turn-down service was shortly after that...just didn't make sense. There were days we left by 9:00 am and turned on the housekeeping light so they could come in and clean, and we would come back late in the afternoon (3 - 5 p.m.) and things still were not done.  This was a $5,000 mistake!",Beauty
X-TMy6z3nz8SJ5Ybe0VnbA,Nwc26t96TlTijEK2RZd-ew,9Hk2_EaKSI8tQl3leMRZYw,2008-04-27,"Not worth the money or hassle.

My story with Ladies and Gentlemen starts a few weeks ago as I was in a wedding and the bride needed a few things brought from the Cleveland area to Warren, I had to get my hair done for the wedding in town on the Sunday morning of the wedding. Now as many of you ladies know most reputable salons including my favorites do not have Sunday hours. So when I found one close to the other places I had to pick things up before the wedding, I thought I had found it all. Well I call Ladies and Gentlemen and the woman on the phone asks what I need done I say simply an updo April 13th as early in the morning as possible. First available they have is 10AM. Not as early as I was hoping but at this point I was satisfied just to have an appointment. This is where my satisfaction ended. 

The morning of my appointment after running all over creation for everything the bride needed and making sure my makeup was done and my overnight bag was complete, I headed to Ladies and Gentlemen. I arrived approximately 10 minutes early. 

I enter the salon and am greeted by the 2 rudest receptionists ever. They were chatting about american idol and the hills (oh the humanity) and seemed so miffed to be interrupted to do their job and check me in. 

As a segway to introduce those of you not familiar with the salon\/spa experience. Normally before you say who you are they know who you are and greet you and take your coat, ask if you would like coffee water lemonade tea etc and if there is anything they can do for you\/help you find while you wait. You do not lift a single finger for yourself. This is why it is normally worth the extra dollars. 

As a frequenter of such establishments to be rudely greeted, my coat not taken, there was a self service station for coffee without any made cause receptionists who we will refer to as thing one and thing two from now on were to lazy, and then to be told my stylist wasn't even there yet, I was rather taken  aback. Number one I was on an already tight schedule and as I have a lot of thick hair I know how long it takes to get put up. Thankfully I was prepared with a photo of what I wanted and it was simple and elegant and best of all sleek. 

At about 1015 my stylist finally shows up. She actually takes my coat. Shocking I know. We head to her station. She dirties up my hair to make it stick. . . It didn't need extra oil but whatever. So I show her the picture which was of my own hair and she said fine. Well I started to get nervous when she started with the curling iron as there are no curls in this style. She puts it up once and it looks like your generic mound o curls and I frankly said that is not what I wanted. So she takes it out. . . and does nearly the same thing again. I really think she was only capable of the one generic I could have gotten it done at best cuts style. I was LIVID. My hair looked like it came out of a jc penneys catalog not vogue. It was anything put sleek. I had a section of hair sticking up in the middle of my head.  But as it took her over an hour just to make that mess I didn't have time for her to try again.  That and frankly with everything I had done that morning I could care less about this wedding except for the fact it would soon be over. Note to all the girls ALL BRIDES are bridezillas the week before their weddings. 

She sprays it with an expensive version of aquanet (made by aveda but its your standard smelly aerosol hairspray) and then takes me to get my coat again. Now any time previously I have ever gotten my hair done at this type of establishment as you walk out from an updo if it is raining (which it was) as a precaution for your newly styled tresses they provide a dye cap or something resembling a cheap shower cap to maintain the dryness needed for one's hair to remain as it was. They have nothing. and of course as  I'm expecting this as part of the drill and don't want a hood messing my hair my coat i had had no hood. So essentially i have to make a mad dash while holding my coat over my head. 

Now that should be the end but alas it was not. After the festivities were over and I was on my couch taking down the royal mess of a style, I realized just what a mess things were. I had pins stuck in a rats nest of pins and hair. My boyfriend had to start taking them out figuring out which was the ""top"" as to not pull out clumps of my hair which was entangled on every pin. Not to mention after all the pins were out (there were 65 definitely overkill for my shoulder length hair)  I had to wash my poor locks 3 times in order to get all the goop out of my hair. 

If you are thinking of getting your hair done here my only advice for you is go to best cuts. The quality of style and service you will get will be the same and its much cheaper.",Beauty

Rock Lobster started off as a Pop up restaurant until they gained many loyal fans who wished for a standing restaurant just like La Carnita... and the wish was granted, tah dah! 
Small but spacious restaurant on Ossington ave that has locals trailing in as well as lobster lovers that supported them ever since they started.

I never had the chance to try our Rock Lobster Food Co before they opened as a restaurant since I personally do not enjoy crowded events and lining up for food.
So was I ever glad to find out they opened a standing restaurant! since I am always on the journey to finding my favorite lobster roll ever since bannock got rid of theirs from the menu.

Since they don't take reservation, me and my friends just decided to drop by around 8 and see how things turn out. It was on a saturday night but we didn't have to wait too long for a table.
Restaurant has overall very laid back feel to it, a little dim with all the servers wearing flannel shirts with fresh seafood display on one side of their bar upfront. I already liked what I saw.

Their menu wasn't that extensive, mainly focusing on seafood such as snow crab, shrimp, oysters and lobsters.

Ordered: Rock Lobster Caesar 4\/5

* Ketel One Vodka, Tobasco, Worchestershire, Steak spice, Clamato and Lobster tail for $12
* Of course I had to order this the moment I found out it had lobster tail in it
* I love caesaes to begin with, it is one of my favorite cocktail
* It is a pretty big cocktail, comes garnished with lobster tail and celery
* I should've ordered it extra spicy since it wasn't very spicy to begin with

Ordered: Lobster Cappuccino 1\/5

* Lobster bisque, creme fraiche, fresh lobster and chives for $6
* This was served with toasted baguette topped with lobster roll filling which I really liked
* This was more so watery than I expected
* I was expecting somewhat of a creamier soup but this was actually more like a drink
* It had small pieces of lobster pieces inside
* Personally I really did not enjoy this, it tasted really fishy and too waterly

Ordered: Lobster Mac n Cheese 2\/5

* Fresh lobster, aged canadian cheddar and panko crust for $14
* I was excited to try this dish because how can you go wrong with mac n cheese + lobster
* Excitement quickly died down when I tried a bite
* This had no flavor was very bland, almost too dry
* Would've preferred it somewhat more rich, and cheesy

Ordered: Crispy Maple Pork Belly 3\/5

* Pork belly and creamed spinach for $12
* We were hesistant to order a meat dish at a seafood restaurant but we thought, it IS porkbelly!
* It came with 4~5 pieces of pork belly which was very crunchy
* The porkbelly has maple syrup glaze on top which made it quite sweet
* I did enjoy it but am unsure if I like it as part of my main course

Ordered: Seafood Tower ""Crows Nest"" 5\/5

* 8 peel and eat shrimp, 6 oysters and 2 snow crab clusters for $39
* This was quite messy to eat but I did really like it
* Peel and eat shrimp is plump and fresh
* Snow crab meat was sweet and the shell cracked somewhat easily
* I did get crab juice and bits of meat all over myself though
* Oysters were served with house cocktail sauce and horseradish on the side
* We also got some rosemary yuzu sauce which I didn't particularly enjoy

Ordered: Rock Lobster Roll 5\/5

* Lobster roll, yukon chips and McClure's dill pickle for $14
* I found my favorite lobster roll once again!
* Served with soft white bread, they don't hold back on the lobster filling
* Lobster is more so chopped up into small pieces, it's perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of creaminess
* Cold lobster filling goes well with the bread and you get so much flavor with every single bite
* I absoultely love their pickle, not too tangy and sweet enough it was very refreshing
* For $14, this is a must get

Complimentary: Sipping Maple Crown Royal Whisky

Complimentary: Beaver Tail

* This was my first time trying a beaver tail! It is basically a deep fried dough covered in sugar. How can it be bad? I enjoyed every bits and pieces of it with extra maple sugar on the side.

Summary: I am glad restaurants like Rock Lobster is making it's way on Ossington Street. Their food is affordable and they serve fresh, quality seafood. Service is friendly and you know they are passionate and proud of what they do when the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing with their meal.
Next time I drop by, I will most definately order the lobster roll and probably stick to fresh seafood. Welcome to Ossington and it was nice meeting you Matt!",Restaurant
y7d7xCg-G2OUHOqwUaYWEQ,RvXTDScB01DbDaV7XOuE-w,HfVSzrebW4PgUsakKv8v-Q,2012-09-06,"I tried. 

I really did. I really wanted this to be ""my watch guy"" for repair and servicing.

After reading all of the amazing reviews about 'The Watch Repair Company' I decided to bring in a few of my old watches with the hope of giving them new life. I brought in older Seiko chronograph that needed a battery, cleaning, and some scratches buffed out. I also brought my Skagen World GMT watch that needed a crown replacement, battery, and cleaning along with my Vostok-Europe Anchar that needed the rotating bezel pin replaced or fixed (to keep the bezel from falling off).

I was certain this was going to be the beginning of a wonderful business relationship. After all, the owner is Russian, one of my watches is Russian, and I even spent some time in Russia, so I knew a little about Russian watches and culture. Gosh this would be great I thought. 

Boy was I wrong. 

Strike One: 
After dropping off the Seiko and Skagen for what I thought would be a pretty quick fix and clean up (the owner tells me this), I get a call a week later stating that the Seiko is ready but he would need more time to fix the crown on the Skagen. 

""Ok, sure. Let me know when it is ready."" 

No worries right? I'm not in THAT desperate of a rush to get the watches back. I can wait. About five days after that, he calls me to inform me that the Skagen is ready with the Seiko for pickup. 

""Bring cash, I don't take Visa.""

Sure. No problem. His business, his rules. I get it. Well, I pick up the Seiko and Skagen to see that yes, they are fixed, but he did not clean or polish them AT ALL and they were both really dirty still. 

""Maybe he just got busy and forgot?"" 

Anyway, while I'm waiting to pick them up there were also several other people (shady looking folks selling gold, and selling it FAST) making deals with him so I felt like mentioning it my ""cleaning problem"" would not have not warranted a good response at that moment. So I figured I would mention it another time, or just clean them myself as I am more than capable. No biggie. 

Strike two: 
A few days later I I decide to give him another go as he mentioned to me that he was an expert in Russian watches. So in good faith (once again) I bring him my Vostok-Europe Anchar, and ask him to fix the bezel. he gives me a ""range"" for a price and so I drop it off. He wasn't sure if he had the parts and said he may have to send it ""to a friend"" to get it fixed. 

""Ok. Just let me know when it's ready"". 

A couple days later he calls me to tell me that maybe I need to call the distributer (only a couple in the U.S) and have the parts paid for, and shipped out here so he can fix it. So to recap, a Russian watch ""expert"" who is now asking me to do the leg work and get the parts needed to repair the watch. Hmmm. At this point I decide not to invest any more time into this, as I can now see where this whole thing is going. I decline politely opting to send the watch to RI for repair instead.  

Strike three: 
A few days after the Vostok fiasco I somehow rationalize with myself that the reason he couldn't fix it was because of the rarity of the watch itself and that i should just stick to ""easier"" repairs for him. 

""Man, I'm trying so hard to give this guy my business it is unreal"" -This what I was thinking at this point. 

I give him a call and ask about crystal replacement for my Skagen. Why not? Surely he's got this under control right? 

""Yes, bring it in. I replace with same crystal, $30.00 cash"". 

""Great. See you Thursday""! 

Not so great when I visit him though. He takes one look at it and tells me he cannot fix it because the crystal is ""too big"". Mind you, he had an extensive amount of time with this watch (I presume) because he had it for close to two weeks when he repaired it the first time. Ugh. 

Here is the deal. I am patience to my own detriment sometimes, I am aware of this. Therefore sometimes I get treated a little poorer by businesses that think I won't do or say anything. I get it. But I really wanted this to by ""my watch guy"" and I was trying so hard to give him my business even after he fell through twice on his end. What else could I do? 

Here is my actual evaluation of his operation:

Got a quartz watch in need of battery? 
See this guy. 

Got ANYTHING of value that you want back in a specific time frame? 
Go to an AD. 

Got a watch over $100 with repairs needed? 
Go to another shop or send it off to an AD or highly recommended place. 

Got gold for sell? 
See this guy for quick cash (it seemed like a popular choice when I was there). 

Sorry, I tried. Guess I'll have to take my business elsewhere. 

One other quick note. The whole ""desperate people selling gold and ONLY dealing in cash"" made me think that this guy's operation of watch repair may be a front for his other dealings. Not saying I care, just saying it came across like that to me as I was waiting for my watches.",Shopping

Roomie wanted us to try this place so we came here for lunch on a Sunday hot afternoon & the moment we open the door it was like PACKED FULL HOUSE CRAZY! The decor was cute like simple diner style.

We Waited for about 15 minutes(party of 3) as our names were on the wait list... the moment a table got up they cleared that table up fast because by the time those people were walking out the door we were already being walked to the table.

The menu was HONESTLY a bit overwhelming w\/ so many different selections double sided not very big font but we pulled it together & decided.

So it took about 7 minutes until someone came to take our drink orders but the waitress that came through was sweet & patient as we ordered too many items for ourselves (the bois mainly) but she got them. She brought out our mason jar juices right away & when they went low she brought us a round of waters. The food took about 20 minutes but it was busy which seemed non-stop until it died out when we got our food.

HAZELNUT PANCAKES $9.75 - 3 huge pancakes served w\/ hazelnut bits, whipped cream, banana, & nutella drizzle. I asked for extra nutella but it seemed normal as there was only drizzle for the first layer. It was also sitting in the window for a while because I saw a big pile of whip cream & there was what looked like liquidized cream when it got to the table along w\/ maybe half a banana in slices.

SOUTHERN BENEDICT  $10.95 - English muffin topped w\/ sausage patty, poached egg, & bacon gravy. Not bad just simple.

NATALIE'S BREAKFAST BURGER $11.95 - this was like a protein on protein on protein stack of protein in between a bun. MEATY but but bland.

GATSPY BURGER $12.95 - Crispy onion strings, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, BBQ sauce, mayo & cheddar cheese...Topped with a sunny side up egg. The beef patty was juicy but it definately needed a little seasoning for the thickness

DREY'S CORN BEEF HASH $4.95 - lots of beef & KAPOWW in yo face flavor!

WILL'S WRAP $6.99 - Onion, peppers, bacon, sausage, cheddar Egg whites, turkey bacon, basil and cheese, potatoes & egg

BITE'S HASH $2.75 - rectangle piece of hashbrown with big chunks of potato

ORANGE JUICE $3.99 - fresh squeezed but it wasn't very cold probably because it was stored in a open display fridge thing

APPLE JUICE $4.99 - freshly squeezed ahahah wasn't my thing my palate needs to get used to it. xP

ALL-IN-ALL it was a cute place to try... there is a variety of choices for those that can't decide on one thing ... i just feel that they could consolidate their menu & focus on the flavor of more specific items. But it could also just not be my style of eats. Just your average eatery for foods that you don't want to cook at home yourself",Restaurant
PlUXwyQ5SviEhB0wRfgOKg,aR7F6JaHjsYW_j5Biih0rQ,k1mNR7eIi-UWVmj_t23Yog,2014-11-03,"This is a revision of my previous review, which really wasn't a review because we went for late night dining on a Saturday and the restaurant was closing for the night despite several social media websites including Yelp which said Sujeo served late. 

After management read my review they contacted me, apologized and sent me a gift card. This is clearly a restaurant that wants it's potential customer base to be happy despite miscommunication across the Internet.   

This evening, a Sunday we were able to score a 2-top without a reservation. The tables are a bit small and beware, the servers behind, buttocks may be sort of in your personal space when they are attending to your neighbors table. 

The menu is pretty big and required explanation to the newbie. Despite the very friendly and helpful waitress, I think I would  have preferred something else as a main dish. 

We ordered the braised eggplant as an appetizer - this was very good with a nice sweet and salty flavor profile with a nice hint of heat. The timing was a bit off as our appetizer arrived with the main course.  

We ordered something called Ssams as a main course to share. This is a large serving of a protein with a variety of Korean pickled condiments, Bib lettuce, and delightful fluffy little rice buns. The condiments were really the highlight of our meal. 

We chose the Ssams special, which tauted as a braised pork shank, that had been portioned and fried. The pork itself was crispy, but bland and extremely fatty. I didn't notice amount of fat until I'd stuffed some of the delicate rice buns and piled on the condiments. 

In fairness the fattiness of the pork may have been customary to the dish and the cuisine, and just not for me or my trusty dining companion. This said over half of the meat portion was simply deep fried and sliced white fat. A better explanation of what we were getting into would have been helpful. 

When I inquired about the fattiness of the meat, explaining that perhaps it was me and maybe the dish just was not particularly my thing, the waitress very politely apologized and we had a nice conversation about the nature of the proteins on the menu. The Korean style is to leave all the fat on the cuts of meat.  The hostess then followed up with us and graciously picked up our appetizer and my companions cocktail. 

There also seems to be an issue with Sujeo's exhaust fan. It blows right into the parking garage. When we pulled into the parking garage it was visibly smoky. I'm not sure if it was a carry over, but the dining room seemed to smell a bit smoky as well. 

Look the menu is pretty robust and I'm not going to fault a restaurant for serving me something I've never had that turned out not to be my thing. Management clearly cares about trying very hard to make a good impression. There are plenty of other choices on the menu and I'll be back to try out one of the many other interesting things on the menu. 

Sujeo's chef proprietor has the chops to make this place work. I think Sujeo will get there. The menu alone adds some real depth to a generally predictable downtown Madison dining scene. I want to like this place given how hard they seem to be trying.",Restaurant

19. They have Hatch Green peppers (canned) but ok do you  know the fame of this pepper no? Well they are the marlon brando of peppers and they are the bomb google it. And I challenge you to find them anywhere else in this city or east of the Mississippi for that matter. 

18. Backpack and hiker food galore, screw those prepackaged military gross meals plan your own and buy them here., Hint canned fish and the dry snacks aisle. 

17. Eggs and Milk at normal prices, yes in other states Milk is not a full 4$ a gallon, and you can get a dozen eggs for under 2$. 

16. The premade fresh Salmon, sour cream and dill wrap just try it and trust me.

15. The mushroom frozen tarte, yes its a little pricey but again trust me. 

14. Organic meats and really good chicken sausages at reasonable prices. 

13. Some of the staff are wearing hawaiin shirts, what its raining outside? I didn't notice.

12. In the spring look for awesome citrus selections I think tried something called Pomellos? Or something to that affect and I think shortly after I drifted into a citrus juice stained coma of bliss. 

11. Cheap fresh herbs......... you cook right? Nuff said. 

10. That cute mural on the wall of Pittsburgh bridges and things when you leave, yea I know driving through the squirrel hill tunnel sucks but is that mural makes your Pittsburgh pride filled heart flutter admit it. 

9. Its clean the bathrooms are always clean and fresh, there are cart wipes if you want them. 

8. Energy bars!!! Why I can I not stop in a giant eagle and buy a Cliff bar? Why do I have to settle for a shitty bag of chips in the middle of my stressful workday. 

7. Frozen tamale, burrito and enchiladas for 1.99-2.99 each cheap work lunches score. 

6. Frozen Kale, yes I am the cliché white person with a college degree who eats Kale deal with it.

5. IT is close to target, the wine and spirits shop and a petsmart, even kinda close to Costco for me. 

4. Really Yummy pasta sauces, haven't tried one there I have not liked but the alfredo and creamy tomato basil are near the top of my list. 

3. Splurge on an orchid for yourself or your lady be trendy they're like 4.99 here. Ok maybe 8 but still. 

2. I think they would sell you booze if they could, I think they sell it in other states. whose liquor laws have progressed past Benjamin Franklin's golden years. 

1. The Naan bread, Colombian instant coffee and Belgian caramel choc in at the checkout ok that's more than one but I had to summarize. 

Do be prepared for tight tiny spaces and lots of shoppers people love their TJ's but also be prepared for a sort of altruistic shopper friendly vibe. Bag your own groceries it makes things go faster.",Shopping
-NPazzkqAJS5yHfykCJDog,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,2016-02-15,"Too loud, too trendy, too touristy, too prominently situated on a nationwide list of top money makers and thus too expensive, Los Angeles import STK is one of *those* restaurants that locals love to hate, and although claims regarding of the dearth of affordable dining on Las Vegas Boulevard may indeed be warranted the fact of the matter is that in an economy built on fantasy there are few restaurants pairing quality cuisine with a club-like environment, a look at the work of Chefs Stephen Hopcraft and  Brigette Contreras showing The Cosmopolitan's third floor Steakhouse to offer just that.

Open at 5:30pm with the digital outdoor menu not yet updated to seasonal changes found inside it was followed by a friend caught in traffic that I was greeted on arrival at the hostess podium and undoubtedly setting a standard with staff that is almost *too* good looking it was not long before seating was offered at a spacious four-top, a pleasant and forthcoming media contact named Erica taking the time to sit down and provide a little background on the restaurant as well as herself until my tablemate arrived.

Admittedly a menu with some sticker-shock, the $150 Lobster Thermidore and $22 Sundae not the most expensive I've seen but enough to give one pause, it was with excellent service from a surprisingly well-informed and energetic young man that the show got underway and although the DJ did not begin until 7:30 the space was jammed by 6:15, a small kitchen expediting like professionals as staff worked at a breakneck pace.

Energetic but never obnoxiously loud, music from The Doors or Bob Dylan followed by oddities from the Early-80's playing overhead as patrons chat and dine, every meal at STK begins with their famous-for-good-reason Brioche Pull-apart topped in Blue Cheese Butter with addictive green dipping oil, signature starters of a split batter-fried lobster tail over slaw and seared duck liver with tiny pancakes proving a bit less sharable than one would expect considering the pricetag, though both were well executed and also tasted great.

Well paced and attentive to details, bussers doing a better job than most local fine dining spots at keeping glasses full and dismissing dirty plates, it was after a quick tour of the black and white room with gator skin print plus light that makes anyone look a little more pretty that a dish of carpaccio arrived and although the meat itself is well flavored with balsamic and tomatoes adding acidity, the most impressive aspect of the dish is the unexpected pesto noodles, delicious on their own but even better when placed within the context of the plate.

Duck recently removed from the menu, but still with numerous entrees, steaks and sides made to share, it was on the server's recommendation that the tender Bone-In Filet was ordered and cooked just past medium-rare the flavor was plentiful, though not as robust as that at Jean Georges, Delmonico or Carnevino, while the Dover Sole spoke to Hopcraft's skills sharpened while working with Michael Mina, a simple roast rendering the white flesh flaky yet moist with brown butter and capers plus crisp fingerlings that might be even better than STK's addictive Parmesan Truffle Fries.

Impressed by the manner in which the kitchen allowed the Mushroom Pot Pie to express its intrinsic earthiness without mellowing it for a ""club"" crowd while taking the corn pudding almost as if it were a pre-dessert considering the substantial use of sugar and cream, the parade of sweetness actually began following a warm Americano that helped to compensate for notably chilly room temperatures, a complimentary trio of housemade ice creams and sorbets highlighted by smooth coconut and a malty version of chocolate both foretelling of good things to come.

Already seeing - and hearing - doubt from the server that two-people could manage four desserts after  ""so much"" food it was with Chef Contreras shattering Apple Tart that the degustation marched on and utilizing phyllo dough plus plenty of butter to construct a high-rising cup around roasted apples the timeless classic found a new level in terms of texture, the robust crust crackling bite-after-bite even as ice cream melted and outperforming STK staples including the rather mundane skillet cookie and exceedingly light donuts that were not excessively sweet despite the maple glaze, best bites being the donut holes with toasty nuts and a dollop of whipped cream.

Particularly intrigued by the aforementioned Sundae, the questions of cost brushed aside with ""big enough to share,"" suffice it to say that although quite well conceptualized in terms of taste and complexity there are far better ways to spend $22 on Ice Cream elsewhere in Las Vegas, the tender banana bread itself likely better utilized as part of recently-launched Sunday brunch or the previous menu's bread pudding.",Restaurant
e0V4poEl1dCzd--02swjQw,6p36W9GQAoKUMGlnkJaotQ,ZjSzUWHtnpCfjsa7CksSOg,2016-04-26,"We came to Vegas for a 4 day\/3 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We had a two night stay at the Orleans already booked (for free) and decided last minute to try this hotel out for our first night. Overall, we're pretty happy with our stay...

When you first pull in to the parking lot you're greeted by a guarded gate. After confirming our reservation, the gates opened and we were directed to the correct tower (we stayed in Tower 3). Loved the security of the guests! When checking in, we were asked if there was any special reason we were staying there and I mentioned that it was our anniversary - we received an upgraded room on a higher level (PH) without asking! Customer service was AMAZING!!! Not just at check in, throughout the entire hotel! Every single employee we encountered, from the front gate security guard, to the valet, the bell guys, the maids, everyone was very, very nice, professional, efficient, and made us feel welcomed!

When we arrived in our 30th floor penthouse room, it was beautiful! A large suite with a HUGE bathroom and spa tub. The ""strip view"" through the huge floor to ceiling windows was nice, but you can't really see the strip from it. The Hilton vacation tower blocked much of our view, but we were able to see the Linq ferris wheel, and at night, it was lit up. The ferris wheel must not have been working because we didn't see it move once during our entire stay throughout the weekend, but it was lit up pretty. We saw everything you can see in the photos provided by previous guests... a large, plush bed, the couch (which was super comfy), sitting chair, and table in the mini living room, a small table with two chairs to eat at, a fridge with 2 small bottled waters, a coffee maker, sink, two burner stove (shocked by this), and in the cabinet, a toaster. We didn't use any of these except the fridge, which kept the drinks we had bought from 7-11 pretty cold, so not sure if they all worked or how well they worked. There's plenty of drawer space for utensils, but they're all empty so you need to bring your own. The TV was nice and there was a DVD (may have been BluRay) player available. The closet has lots of space and has an iron, ironing board, and extra blankets and a pillow (I assume for the couch's pullout bed, but we didn't use it), but I didn't see any robes like some other reviewers had mentioned. 

The bathroom is lovely, with nice flooring and double sinks so there was plenty of room for both of us to get ready with nice toiletries. The shower is spacious and I love that the toilet is tucked away in it's own separate little room for privacy. We've been married a long time, but we still enjoy our privacy during bathroom breaks! The spa tub is, again, HUGE, and YES, is plenty big enough for two!! The Mister is 5' 11"" and I'm 5' even, and we're both a little ""meaty""; we fit perfectly with some room to spare! Me alone, I was practically swimming in it! The jets were a lifesaver, because both of us had backaches after the long drive through traffic from California. We didn't want to leave the tub, but had tickets to see a show at the Mirage. We did end up getting right back in when we got back, even though it was nearly 1 in the morning.

As much as we really enjoyed our stay, there were a few downsides:

* Although the rooms seem private, you still hear everything going on in the room next to you. I don't know if the lady next to us was just a naturally loud talker, but we could just about hear the whole conversation. I know I laugh loud, so I was afraid that I would disturb them when we were watching TV. I could hear guests turning the water on and off and flushing the toilet in the room on the other side of us, too (only when we were also in our bathroom, so not a huge deal). 

* It's kind of hard to get into the spa tub because the edging around it is so wide. I'm short, so I usually have a tough time with large tubs, but the Mister is pretty tall and even he had a hard time. 

* The faucet in the spa tub was a little loose, like someone had leaned on it one too many times (probably because the tub is so hard to get in to). 

* The shower tile was very slippery! This could be a hazard. I mentioned to the Mister that I knew we wouldn't be able to bring my 75 year old grandmother (who we bring to Vegas a lot) to this hotel because she wouldn't be able to use the hard to get in to tub or the shower because she might slip. A shower tile that's more porous would be helpful and perhaps a bench in the shower.

* The bed sheets pretty stiff. The bed was comfy, but the sheets could have been softer for a nicer rest.

* One sink was clogged with a bunch of ash looking stuff in it. Since we were only staying the one night, this was not a huge deal or reason to complain to the front desk, so we both just used one sink.

We paid $190 for a Friday night, a few minor issues, but still not a bad stay. We may return again, especially if deals are provided by our MLife cards!",Beauty
QjF9ZiluuAsVcZba3zasIA,p4UcEYTLJyh96o1R8wrJaQ,xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w,2012-01-08,"My NY daughter, who is fast becoming a food connossieur herself, was very interested in trying a restaurant by one of her celebrity chef idols, Tom Colicchio.  Although there are a few to pick from in Manhattan, she came with us to Vegas to have her first experience (and ours) in one of his restaurants.  For all of us, this was our one big splurge meal on the trip.  While not much in Las Vegas is reasonably priced anymore, we went here knowing this would be the case.

Overall, I give Craftsteak 4 stars, but as it honestly reminded me so much of Mastro's, I found myself comparison rating it up one side and down the other.  I really liked the food at Craftsteak, don't get me wrong, but I didn't think it was worth the prices they charged, and yes, they were more expensive than Mastro's.  They pretty much served the same types of entrees and sides, but I really think Mastro's is one cut above (no pun intended.....well, maybe a little).

Service was good, but nothing and no one will top Erin @ Mastro's in Thousand Oaks.  She was truly that notch above and made us feel like we were the King and Queen of dining.  We wanted for nothing.  However, the two male waiters @ Craftsteak were nice, but I often felt uncomfortable asking for their assistance, and they certainly weren't treating us all that special.  I think they stayed a little too much in the background, but yes, they got the job done.  I will say, however, when I did ask questions, they were forthcoming with their opinions of the food, and we were not steered wrong.

There was one aspect that was disappointing........both my younger daughter and I LOVE rack of lamb, and while it was on the menu and we wanted it, it was NOT available by the time we placed our order.  Big letdown.....but not the restaurant's fault, either.  Here is what we did order..........

32 oz. porterhouse steak, served with bearnaise sauce - at $96.00., it should have been outstanding, but it was very good.  The meat was a little tough in areas.  It became excellent with bearnaise sauce on it.  Well done on a sauce that I haven't had in YEARS.  LOVE that sauce.

Diver sea scallops - waiter recommended, and they were excellent.  A little light on flavor, but cooked to perfection.

Grilled asparagus - very nicely prepared and seasoned, and not too lemony as I feared it might be.  Asparagus is truly my favorite vegetable.

Roasted fingerling potatoes with rosemary - while not dried out, it needed some kind of sauce, and I was a little disappointed that the promised rosemary was not infused into the potatoes in a much bigger way, instead of just a sprig decorated on top.  I dipped them in the steak au jus, which was quite good.  If it were me ordering a potato side, this would NOT have been my choice, especially with all the choices available.....but my daughter selected, so this was what she chose.

Mushroom assortment (4 different kinds) -  a wonderful introduction into some exotic mushroom types - maybe could have been sauteed a little more, and perhaps with a bit more butter \/ flavor, but still, they were good.

Caesar salad with pickled anchovy - we ordered 2 caesar salads, which were split in half, and there was MORE THAN ENOUGH salad to go around between the four of us.  Very generous portions.  Not a huge fan of lettuce leaves in their whole form.  I much prefer the lettuce be cut already, but it also didn't detract from it for that reason.  What did detract was the ever-present lack of enough dressing issue.  Always happens.  What leaves did have enough dressing on them tasted just fine.  The pickled anchovy wasn't too bad, either, esp. if eaten sparingly.

For dessert, my daughters ordered chocolate souffles with caramel sauce and a simply divine hazelnut ice cream laced w\/chocolate shavings.  The ice cream was TRULY amazing.  I didn't care too much for the souffle, though.  I think it was a bit undercooked.  Never been my thing, though.  My husband and I split the cinnamon monkey bread with sour cream toffee ice cream.  Not sure how I feel about this dish.  The ice cream was dreadful......waaaaaaaaaay too much on the sour cream.  Strange.  As for the monkey bread, yes, it was delicious, esp. with the ooey-gooey caramel sauce over it, BUT........I felt like I was eating a breakfast food item.  It just didn't smack of the stuff elegant nighttime desserts are made of.  I don't know, I just wasn't feeling it.  Because we were celebrating my younger daughter's birthday, they brought a complimentary cheesecake w\/ a raspberry coulis. 

While I have been somewhat critical of the food, overall, we definitely enjoyed our meal here.  However, for this restauranteur's celebrity status and the matching prices, I honestly expected better from him.  That being said, I would certainly return to this place.  I just can't give this a 5-star rating.",Restaurant
zpIrKWWsHfkkU7Y4i9qT2g,lQlxinXz7QpuoqfRWkO_MA,_SSF9W16ejRMDFniokfeOA,2011-08-03,"Seems that Living Social has quite a few coupons that it has for Cloud 9. I too purchased a coupon for Brazilian and eyebrow waxing.

First, appearance....when I drove up to the location, I got a pit in my stomach and got nervous that this wasn't going to be a good experience. The place looks like it's in the middle of construction. I understand doing a ""face lift"" to your store, but a nice note that says ""please pardon our dust"" or at the very least make sure all the other areas that are visible upon entering are well maintained. 

Second, customer service & services rendered. I was asked to arrive 15 minutes early and the place was closed. My appointment was at 10am, the door said they open on Sundays at 10am. I left because the doors were locked and called to make sure I had the right location. A man answered and confirmed the address and cross streets. When I returned, the door was unlocked and there were two other people in the waiting area filling out paper work. The man working on the lighting had to go to the back and get someone to help me. Myra came out, I gave her my name and she apologized and said she was still setting up for me and it would be a few moments. I only waited about five minutes....so that wasn't so bad. I was taken to the back rooms were services are done and I was quite impressed on how nice it looked. I took a chance and asked if we were able to squeeze in waxing for my underarms. I understood if she was busy, but thought I'd give it a whirl. Myra was great and said it wouldn't be a problem. I was in room 4 and I couldn't help but notice how dimly lit the room was. When Myra walked over to the lamp, I thought I would be alleviated, but to no avail. Yes, the room got brighter, but only on the other side of the room. It was still quite dim where my services were being done. She said we would do my eyebrows first. She had me sit up for this process. I've never heard of such a thing. She did a good job, but what if wax dropped onto my clothes? I usually get my eyebrows threaded, but this service came in the package. She did my underarms. Quick and virtually painless. My Brazilian took nearly 45 minutes. I don't know about you, but that isn't the most comfortable of services and that was just way too long. The wax wasn't cooperating, I guess....but where I usually go, they have a strict 15 minute policy. In, wax, done and out. I didn't go there because I moved and it's way on the other side of town....I think my old place will be worth the drive. Also, they have a blind massage therapist, which is fine, but she kept interrupting my services for things she needed. There needs to be someone on hand that can assist her instead of having another client's services interrupted. 

Finally, the clean up, payment and overall conclusion. I've gone to many waxing salons. I have never had the person waxing me stay in the room as I dressed. It wasn't weird to the point where she was watching me dress, she was cleaning up the work area...but generally they leave the room and let you get dressed. She walked me out and informed me that since I bought the Living Social coupon, if I rebook those services, I'd receive 25% off. Sounds good, but I wouldn't put myself through that again. Most of that time I was watching the clock wishing for it to go by quicker. I paid for my additional waxing (which they did discount as well) and tipped Myra pretty well. Most of my gripes aren't with her, they are more the store in general....not her fault. From what I've read in previous posts....looks like they need new management\/owners.",Beauty
ELS-EifTCRx-LSoSybfOlg,KAjUwkoKnVrM-_jUx5TKlA,FgSHrlynH9MKu5JzRAwzHA,2012-06-05,"So if you read the other reviews you see some themes that run through all the reviews.  It's huge, things can get expensive, and there are small bumps in the road due to the relative newness of the store.  The merits of all those I will leave to you to judge I can only talk about my experience with the whole experience.

  By nature I'm disorganized, and not in like misplace a paper here or there.  Instead its much like OMG which of the 18 separate 6"" piles of papers is the one sheet I need.  Hard to explain to the wife that I know that I placed that check somewhere on my desk I'm just not sure where.  But I digress, just know that the desk in my office was roughly the size of a 1967 Cadillac and had to be downsized so I could put myself on a forced efficiency diet.  

  My experience started where all good experiences should start..at my kitchen table with my laptop and a cup of coffee.  I looked at their website and decided that I liked their elfa desk systems.  Went upstairs to my office took 2 minutes to look at my office and decided WOW my closet was actually the size I wanted to restrain my desk and all of it's contents too.  I took a few measurements and called the 800 number.  Within 20 seconds I had a human being on the phone and she planned the whole thing out for me.  It took her maybe three minutes to design it and she immediately emailed me the plan.  You get three different views front view schematics, top down view and a measured view.  They offered to place the order while I was on the phone with the local store but I declined due to the fact I wanted to look at their in store display before deciding.
  
  So fast forward 5 hours and I come bouncing into the Organization Oasis aka my worst enemy.  Went back to the elfa section and an incredibly pleasant saleswoman helped me.  She was able to immediately pull up my design from earlier in the morning and then I requested some changes.  Being a new employee in the store she wasn't sure how to make the changes so instead of wasting my time trying to figure it out she called over someone else, and someone else, and another someone else.  Some less civilized people would see this as a problem, I saw it as world class service, if you aren't positive that something is right keep on looking for the correct solution, waiting an extra 10 minutes in the store is so much better than having to come back to the store 3 hours later to fix a problem.  

  With all my changes in I was told my order would be ready to pick up in 45 minutes so I went and took care of some shopping at Whole Foods.  They took my number so they could send me a text message when it was ready and they were spot on it took 43 minutes.  We now come to the one ""challenge"" that I hold the store accountable for.  I call the store number talk to an employee they tell to park in the customer pickup spot and someone will be out.  They tell me to call when I arrive and I tell them I arrived, I'm in the Whole Foods parking lot 500 feet away from their store.  They fine just pull into the marked area and we will bring your stuff out.  I park and wait...and wait.....and wait some more.  After 7 minutes I get out of the car running with lovely air conditioning go into the store wait while 5 employees have a conversation only to discover the employee who has all my stuff  has been standing inside the door the whole time.  I'm just assuming that somehow expectations and wires got crossed somewhere.  So they bring this whole cart full of shelves and drawers out to my care and load it.  Instead of using a plastic bag they used 2 very nice reusable shopping bags for all the hardware and a nicely printed custom set of instructions.

  Got the closet in at home in no time flat with an amazing lack of profanity on my part and am very pleased with how easy and convenient it was.  I'm sure that I could have spent less somewhere else, but the experience would not have been as pleasant and smooth as it was.

I'll be back for more!!!",Shopping
9SbL5zufELQ6aAqcS7adpg,Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,Fv4EXwV30rwGD2NzN1ekgA,2016-08-23,"A recently opened new sushi place by UNLV area which has a special of 50% off AYCE during the first week. Heard from a friend who went there earlier today for lunch so decided to try it out for dinner 

Outside reminds me of Kabuto, a high end omakase style only restaurant in town. Simplistic plain, white walls with narrow windows.... except it all changes when u go inside. Very conflicted decor. Lol. Ceiling had a nice design with the varying height lighting. the sushi bar and the wall behind looked nice with the layered acoustic sound dampening foam lookin like design wall (i dont know how to describe it) Then... u have the cheap bar chairs that look like they are from hawaii, and tables with benches that remind me im in a food court. see? conflicted.....

We were sat at a table fairly quickly and had our drink orders taken. And that was that. Lol. One of my friends had written down our nigiri order on a napkin and handed it to the waitress. It took one or two more servers to ask us before we had actually even received our waters. 

Food came out periodically. Fairly slowly. Actually quite slow considering they seemed to have a fully staffed sushi bar with 3 chefs and a restaurant barely half full, if that. The dining room staff was very attentive in repeatedly asking us if everything was ok, by multiple people... but nothing ever came out quicker than expected after telling them we were waiting for our orders. 

Fish to rice ratio was pretty decent but fish slice size were definitely inconsistent. Fish slices varied in thickness. Some quite thin. Some quite thick. Their sexy salmon nigiri was essentially a salmon nigiri with a slice of avocado on top, slice of lime without the peel but WITH the seeds, some spicy thousand island-like sauce, and a small spot of sriracha. Quite inconvenient to eat when u have to eventually pull out the seed from the cut slice of lime. Nigiri overall were ok. The most weird one was probably the Ikura. Never had i seen such ""ugly"" ikura. Quite the few were ""deflated"" and ""flat"". Some seemed ""mushed up"". Color seemed a bit off too. Rice was a bit weird in combination with the ikura. Rice seemed mushy in this order. The rice, itself, in the nigiri was ok but would have preferred a little more vinegar taste but seemed to vary in quality over the course of the night. Some was soft, some seemed like it sat out for a while..... 

Our 2nd order essentially disappeared, despite being placed to the manager himself. Order was checked on by the servers and eventually the manager. We had ordered the Gorilla tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi as well as some hand rolls and appetizers. Tuna sashimi had some cajun spice on top. Salmon sashimi had some weird sweet sauce on it and cut weirdly.. Yellowtail with ponzu but fairly ""normal"" in that aspect. I had ordered a salmon avocado handroll and a salmon skin hand roll. When the handrolls came, the manager was like, ""oh i had the chef put more fish in the handrolls for you since it took so long"". To be honest, i dont feel like it was larger than how any other restaurant would have done it. Also, my salmon skin handroll became a salmon handroll, with less salmon than my salmon avocado handroll. Lol Friend's agedashi appetizer came before the sashimi's but my green mussels were no where to be found

As mentioned previously, food came out slowly. probably a good 15 minutes or longer between each dish. 

We had originally arrived at 8... by the time we got thru our 2 orders... they were asking for last call by 1030. We decided to just give up and go for dessert. Something outside of the sushi chef's realm. It was a choice of either ice cream, mochi, or tempura ice cream. With tempura ice cream, we had a choice of what ice cream, so each of us ordered one as well as other things. The server later came back soon after taking our order and told us they were out of all tempura ice creams and asked if we'd like to order any other ones in addition to what we had before. So we did. When the desserts came out, the ice creams had chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Normally it wouldnt be weird to have this happen but who in their right minds would drizzle chocolate syrup on top of green tea ice cream.... another weird combination by gorilla sushi ! ! 

Price wise WITH the 50% off is a great deal but you must allocate quite the amount of time to eat. After about 2.5 hours, we still left not really full. Would have loved to order more but they were so slow in fulfilling their orders, who knows when we'd get it... IMAGINE how much worse it can get when the restaurant is actually full.",Restaurant
RqVsfL7-S9T9yCbEz20oZQ,LniX0WqyE-kKMjNXinM6AA,sZkfaqq75sHnTvvskHbewA,2011-12-31,"See the end of the review for an update.

I just took my daughter to Glama Gal for her birthday.  This was her first ""spa"" experience.  When I called to set up the appointment I was told that they have a mommy & daughter package, and both would get a manicure and a pedicure, but that they don't cut out the dead skin around the nail and that they use the OPI nail polish (which is generally good quality).  We would also get a photo to take home.  In addition to that I ordered a craft - my daughter would get to make her own lipgloss or lipstick to take home.  The cost for the package was $45 for each person (didn't matter whether adult or child), and the cost for the craft was $10.

When we showed up for the day we were greeted and got crocs for our feet and spa robes to put on over our clothes.  The salon looks pretty nice if you don't pay close attention to the paint job.  Fairly pleasant overall.  However, one thing that I noticed right away was that there were no manicure tables or pedicure chairs.  I thought that it was odd, but figured that it would work somehow.  We got to go into a small room and pick out some bath fizzies that would go into the soaking water.  We also got vanilla ice cream to eat during out pedicures.  This was the end of the good part.

The pedicures were received with us sitting on a couch.  My daughter had to have a bunch of pillows behind her, as she wasn't tall enough to sit comfortably.  Our feet got to soak in 2 large bowls (definitely not large enough for adult feet).  The nailpolish that I had on my feet was left on during the soak, and the soak itself took about 2 minutes.  There was no nail cutting, no cuticle cutting (that I was aware of, from the phone conversation, but I did expect to have the rest of the pedicure\/manicure).  A bit of filing with the cheapest, harshest nailfile you could find.  The nailpolish was old (even though it was OPI brand), and I had to ask them to put thinner into it, so it would go on the nails in some acceptable manner.  We had 1 person do everything, which meant a wait for one of us at all times.

When the pedicures were done we went over to a bar where they apparently do manicures (as opposed to regular tables).  The chairs at the bar were regular, so again, my daughter couldn't reach.  I found this odd, as the place says that they serve children from the age of 6.  She had to get a chair from the person who was doing the manicure, just so she could put her hands up on the bar.  

The person doing the manicures\/pedicures had no clue what she was supposed to do beyond just painting nails.  She said that she had 1 year of experience in this place, but didn't study for this.  She was unable to cover the whole nail or to make the nailpolish go on smoothly (this might have been just the crappy polish).  The photo that was printed had two huge finger smudges on it, and had to be redone.  Also, no nail dryers available at all, making it much harder for the polish to dry, especially on the hands of children.

I would definitely NOT recommend this place beyond a one time shot for a child, for the ""general feeling"".  The manicures and pedicures were atrocious, and even though we spent 1.5 hours at the ""spa"", our nails were still getting smudged when we came home another hour later.  This is too expensive for just the experience.  If they got some real manicurists, this place would make sense, otherwise - don't bother.

Jan 5, 2012 UPDATE - I just received a phone call from the owner.  She was very pleasant, and appologized profusely for what happened.  Apparently, she was away due to a family emergency during the time of our appointment, and was not able to oversee her business.  She seemed very interested in improving it, and offered me a refund and a chance to try them again.

She also explained some things - she said that the steel bowls are easier to disinfect due to not having jets, and that they have a smaller table for manicures that they should have used.  Also, they should have put a quick drying coat on top of our nailpolish, which they didn't do. Finally, she said that they have 3 esthetitians, but the one who was supposed to be working that day called in sick.

I believe that the owner truly cares about her business and is sincere about improving it.  The fact that she is able to acknowledge mistakes and work on them is already more than what 99% of business owners are able to do.  5 stars for the owner, and her personal service.  

I guess it may we worth a try if the owner is there, as well as an esthetitian.",Beauty

I've taken a few days to try to cool off to write this review, because Friday afternoon, I WAS LIVID with Azteca Wedding Plaza. Now you can ask everyone that has encountered me while I've been wedding planning, I've been laid back with everything. Some may say too laid back. But what can I say, why get all uptight and frustrated and turn into a Bridezilla when this is supposed to be a happy joyous occasion? My girls and groom know what happened this past Friday. They all think I had a right to be furious. 

Flash back to June 26th. The date for my bridesmaids dress appointment. Everything went beautifully, well except the fact that it was going to take 3+ months to get their dresses in. But none the less, we had a good experience. 

They dropped the girls dresses about $40 in price, BUT because of the tight schedule, the owner informed me that paying for rush shipping would be a pointless. But instead to opt for a Rush Cut, which was a $20 charge per dress instead of $60+ for rush shipping per dress. I paid the extra $60 ($20 for 3 dresses), and the owner gave an estimation of mid September of the arrival of the dresses. A little close, but we're still good on time. 

Fast forward to this past Friday.....I out of curiosity give Azteca a call to check on the status of the dress. The guy on the phone informed me that the dresses arrived to the store on AUGUST 25th, and that an email had been sent out to my email address. Um, okay. I never received an email from Azteca. I repeated this multiple times over the phone.  I check my email multiple times a day on my phone. I would have seen that! I rush down there HOT and ready for some explanations. If an email had been sent out, but no response..phone call..nada had been received from the bride\/bridal party, WHY would a place of business NOT reach out via telephone?!? WHY?!? 

I arrive to Azteca and head over to the dress side. I wait for about 15 minutes before I am acknowledged. Granted, there's 2 customers being helped on the dress side, one of them standing next to me, but I did not even a hello\/welcome\/go f yourself you got the email from the employee or owner. Finally, I am acknowledged by the employee who's been sitting right in front of me. ""Have you been helped?"" I wanted to say, ""I've been standing here IN FRONT OF YOU for 15 f-ing minutes without anyone greeting me. Are you blind? And does my facial expression LOOK like I've been helped?"" I in my most calmest voice say, ""No, I have not been helped yet."" I explain the situation and he happened to be the guy on the phone i had just spoken with. I say, well I need to see the owner. He says the owner is with a customer right now, but he'll be with me shortly. So I wait. 

10 more minutes go by and the same guy who I had spoken with asks me if I want to see the dresses. I of course say yes. He goes to the back to go find them. 15 minutes go by and no dresses. A few minutes later, the same guy who was getting the dresses for me walks out and goes off to help another customer. Still no dresses. REALLY?! REALLY!? 

The owner finally comes over and we go back and forth. He confirms my email address and stands firm that they sent an email out on the 25th. I stand firm at the fact that I never received an email. He asks me if I checked my junk folder. I proceed to tell him that I've gotten multiple emails from Azteca before and their email address is in my contact list. I ask him if they receive no communication from the bride after said email is sent, do they telephone the customer? He flat out says no and that most brides call them in anticipation of when the dresses will get there. That and 90% of the time, the email communication works. HELLO! I paid for a rush cut, so THEY didn't even truly know when the dresses might have arrived. They only gave me an estimated date of mid September. So maybe I should have rang them every week to see when the dresses would ship! MY BAD! I'm sorry, but solely relying on internet\/email communication is not the proper way to do business and communicate with the customer. 

I tell him I am extremely upset at the fact that my bridesmaids could have already had their dresses fitted. I ask what he's willing to do to rectify the situation. He says NADA! He is not willing to do anything. But he's very sorry. SORRY!? I wanted to tell him he'd be really be sorry when I hop over this counter and kick the living sh*t out of him! Needless to say, my sensibility kicked in. 

I paid off the remaining balance for the dresses and stormed out with them in tote.  I was not about to have my bridesmaids subjected to Azteca for alterations, which they are fine with. 

My recommendation, GO TO DAVID'S BRIDAL for ALL your bride\/bridesmaids dress needs.

Azteca = ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PS - I found the email in my Trash folder.  But it wasnt from ""Azteca Bridal"" like all previous emails.  It was from ""REPLY"".",Shopping
lJvnU1qr_uKKLZN0XygnKg,65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw,RwRNR4z3kY-4OsFqigY5sw,2015-06-15,"The WAIT:

What seems to be the concern to most people is the wait for these products.  I asked others how long they had to wait and they were curious to know how long I had to wait.  To answer this I had to wait just under 30 minutes.  Other people have had to wait about an hour or more from their responses.  

There is a pretty reliable metric for to determine how long you will have to wait if you see a line there.  For every 10 people ahead of you, you will have to wait about 15 minutes.  The store is very small, in fact it is so small that the only space available is for the 10 people to come in at a time pay, and leave.  

Example:  If there are 35 people ahead of you and you are the 36th person in line then 3 batches of 10 people will be ahead of you and you're in the 4th batch which means you won't get in for about an hour.  

The PRODUCTS:

At the time I went to Uncle Tetsu they only have 2 products; the Japanese cheesecake itself and these muffins called Madelines.  The cake is a no brainer you are there for that so you are automatically getting one.  The muffins (I've also heard them referred to as cookies) are about 2 bucks a piece and if you buy 3 they give you another for free.  

The PRICES:

The cheesecake is 10 bucks.  The sign outside clearly states that it's 10 bucks but it's actually 8 something with tax and works out to be 10.09 but they just round it down to 10 even.  The Madelines work out to be 7.55 after taxes for 4 so basically for the maximum you are allowed come out with it will be 17.55 for one cheesecake and 4 Madelines.  

In case you didn't know you are only allowed to buy this maximum (for now).  You can't roll in and say you'd like multiple cheesecakes, only one per person.  If you want more, bring people with you.

The TASTES:

The cheesecake itself is not what you would expect of a New York style cheesecake because it is not that.  In order to appreciate this food you have to remove what you think you know or what your expectations are when you think of cheesecake as you may know it and just eat the cheesecake.  It is what it is, a lighter, fluffier, non rich, non sweet Japanese cheesecake.  If is so light it almost has the consistency of fluffy light scrambled eggs with milk almost like a flan but it doesn't break apart the same way.

If you are expecting something with the thickness and richness of something out of the Cheesecake Factory then you will be disappointed it's as simple as that.  Let's face it, homemade tomato sauce with a meat broth base is not the same as buying a jar of Ragu.  You simply cannot compare apples to oranges because they are different.  Try to keep that in mind when you try this for the first time.

The Madelines to me are not cookies.  I don't know why others refer to them as cookies.  To me they are muffins.  They are shaped like muffins, they are soft like muffins and they are served in muffin liners that must be peeled away.  I've not had cookies served in muffin liners, ever.  To me these are not special in any way and are in fact over priced for what they are.  

The PACKAGING:

The cheesecakes are put individually into thin cardboard boxes.  The boxes then has a cheesecloth type liner where the cake is carefully placed inside and then covered with the cloth and the lid closed. Keep in mind this cake just came out of the oven minutes before and it will be warm.  Each cheesecake is ""branded"" with the Uncle Tetsu logo in the middle prior to packaging.

The Madelines are simply in a paper bag that is sealed with a sticker. 

Both these items (if you buy both) for me were placed in a large red plastic bag.  The bag was tied and handed over that way. 

Now the cake is warm and with warm things it may cause condensation on the inside.  I'd suggest opening the bag to let it breathe instead of allowing the moisture to condense inside of the tied bag where it cannot escape and thus making the inside of the bag damp.

It took about an hour to get this cake home from downtown before I was able to place it in the fridge to cool.  By the time I arrived home the warmth from the bag pretty much had worn off.  It was suggested that the cake be chilled for about an hour before eating I'm guessing to let it settle.  

The BOTTOM LINE

Anybody that knows me knows I'm not a dessert person.  I'm not big on most dessert but I will have some from time to time.  This was an exception of course considering I had to wait for it.  This was primarily for my wife who knew I was in the city and I asked her if she wanted me to get one.  She enjoyed it as did I for the little sliver of it that I had.  The experience is nice but you'd have to weigh it with how long YOU would be willing to wait for it.  Really I'm sort of indifferent to the products (for now).  They will however add more things and I'm guessing the intrigue may taper of as time goes on.  Hopefully they will always have lines but time will tell.  

For me, 3* only because not really a dessert person.",Restaurant

From the minute we checked in to the minute we exited the Chunnel, my friends and I were treated like royalty.  This is, by far, one of the best dining experiences I've had. And the man who made it an even better experience was our server, Dennis.  We started off with drinks and had a question regarding Pimms Cup.  We were not familiar with the alcohol, so we asked Dennis who proceeded to give us a brief history of the origin of the liquor.  We were blown away!  The drink by the way, was delicious. Sweet, bubbly, and very refreshing. Next came the bread.  Yes folks, I am about to swoon over the bread.  The prosciutto and fig bread left a smokey flavor in my mouth that I almost did not want to eat anything else in order to savor the flavor.  I said almost.  But then I put a little bit of butter with the black, volcanic, himalayan sea salt over the stilton bread which left me with my own salty volcanic explosion on my tongue.  Amazing!

It was time to order and Dennis was very patient with us.  He was honest and helpful about what to order and gave great descriptions about the food.  For an appetizer we decided to go with the kobe sliders and the chorizo stuffed lobster.  Both which were very satisfying.  The beef was juicy and seasoned well.  The lobster had a bisque over the top that, if I could, I would pour myself a bath of it and eat my way out.  Then came our main course.  As a Hells Kitchen fan, I had to try the beef wellington.  That was a no brainer.  Between the table, we also had the roasted chicken and filet.  For the sides we had the carrots and the mac and cheese.  Did the beef wellington live up to the hype?  Why yes friends, it did.  Dennis recommended medium rare which I was a little leery about because I usually prefer medium.  But he had not steered me wrong yet so I had to do it.  And he was right.  The wellington came out beautifully with a perfect crusty, flaky puff pastry and melt in your mouth beef.  My mouth was overwhelmed with flavor.  I also sampled my friends dishes and the chicken was moist, the carrots left a hint of heat in my mouth, and the mac and cheese.... Oh, that mac and cheese.  The perfect blend of cheeses.  Salty, creamy, with a little bit of a crunch over the top.  One of the best I've ever had.  

Completely stuffed from my meal, I still had to save room for desert.  I've heard so much about the sticky toffy pudding that I knew I had to try it.  Dennis agreed.  He told us about this award winning sticky toffy pudding and we knew we couldn't leave without it.  We also ordered the carrot cake to sample the menu a little more.  The carrot cake was delicious and I do not want to undersell it because that alone would have been a great end to the meal.  But the sticky toffy pudding brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it.  The presentation was creative with the brown butter ice cream in the form of a stick of butter and a small butter knife in it.  Then there was the mouth watering sauce over the top of the warm, fluffy pudding.  I took a bite with each component and I literally sighed and melted into my seat.  Best. Dish. Ever.  I would make the 5 hour drive every week to Vegas to get just one bite of this sticky toffy pudding.  If you go to Gordon Ramsay Steak and can only get one thing, GET THE STICKY TOFFY PUDDING! 

I've been to many fine dining restaurants before and this one is definitely at the top of the list.  Thank you Dennis, for making it a fun and inviting experience.  The next time I am in Vegas, I will visit Gordon Ramsay Steak again.  Here's hoping Mr. Ramsay will venture out to Phoenix and leave behind one of his awe inspiring restaurants.",Restaurant

My husband loves meat and wanted to try this spot as soon as he discovered it. It seemed like good fuel before our axe throwing league night. 

Sin City Smokers Barbeque is located in an older shopping center at Sunset and Green Valley. It's not the nicest looking shopping center so I was pleasantly surprised when we stepped inside the restaurant. The restaurant is very clean and uncluttered. The Texas BBQ themed décor was cute and added to the ambiance. The counter is in the middle of the restaurant where orders are taken and then brought to the table. The entrance divides two sections of seating. The inside of the restaurant is well done for a casual dining spot. The restaurant smells amazing as soon as you walk in the door too.

The menu offers several meats and from there you choose if you want the meat in tacos, a salad, plated, as a sandwich, in a quesadilla, or on fries. There are about half a dozen side options that come a la carte. In addition there are several specialty sandwich options and daily specials. The menu doesn't look big, but there are a actually a lot of options.

My husband and I decided to share a few things. Unfortunately, they were out of ribs so we had to go with another meat. We chose Brisket and Smoked Pork. The brisket was marbled and didn't have a lean option. I really liked the flavor of it and when only eating half of the portion the amount of fat was fine. It would have been too rich for me to eat alone. The smoked pork was delicious and moist. I liked the traditional sauce that came with the meats. It had a little heat and a smoky flavor. The sweeter sauce was good, but I preferred the traditional sauce. 

For sides we shared Maple Bacon Sweet Baked Beans and Jalapeno Potato Salad. We both loved the baked beans and they were sweet indeed. I love that they didn't hold back on the maple flavor. The potato salad was good and the jalapeno didn't overwhelm the flavor or add too much heat. The only disappointment was the Sweet Tea. My husband declared it garbage and upon tasting I asked if he had grabbed from the wrong drink dispenser. Hopefully it was just a bad batch and it'll be better next time.

The pricing seemed about right in comparison to other BBQ spots in the area. Most places offer a plate that comes with sides, but even with the a la carte ordering it didn't add up to more than other restaurants charge for a combination plate. It'd be cool if the plated option that comes with onions and a jalapeno included a small piece of cornbread or even a slice of white bread (traditional to Texas BBQ style).

The portions aren't as large as some other spots, but I kind of liked that it was easy to enjoy BBQ without overdoing it. With my husband and I sharing two meats and two sides I'd say that our meal was on the lighter side. Each side made a small serving for each of us. 

We'll be back. Hopefully the ribs will be available next time!",Restaurant
QeYVJR-GgP6Cr9p7AQhyuA,aArP4vt3_7ylIRwovEuiVg,Nx-xvCj4mxFJgd48kTjgwQ,2010-05-01,"I knew when I chose Davids Bridal for my bridal party's dresses that I was not going to receive incredible customer service or, for that matter, quality.  I picked them because a) they're cheap and b) they're everywhere, and I and my bridesmaids are all students or recent graduates and scattered across three states.

When my pre-husband, local bridesmaid, and I arrived at DB on a Saturday in late February (we'd seen an ad about a sale), the place was pretty crowded, and the women at the table in front seemed astounded that I hadn't made an appointment.  I explained to them that I was really just interested in looking at one particular wedding gown I'd seen on the website (I had the style number and a picture printed out), and a couple of bridesmaid dresses, since I was actually leaning towards finding a bridesmaid dress for myself as well.

I was informed, after a lot of form-filling out that never actually seemed to get used for anything except selling my phone number to every wedding vendor in southern Wisconsin, that I would just have to wait until they could ""squeeze [me] in,"" and that while I could browse the bridesmaid and formalwear sections, I was not allowed to go into the bridal gown racks because ""we're very busy today.""

After about 15-20 minutes of looking at bridesmaid dresses--we found the two I'd short-listed from the website in the first 5--my bridesmaid got fed up and dragged me into the wedding gown racks, where we flagged down one of the ""consultants"" and got the bridal gown I was considering.  Then we let ourselves into an unused fitting area, and within 20 minutes we had determined that one of the bridesmaid dresses was the clear winner.  (Just as well--it was about 1\/3 the cost of the bridal gown, and it looked fantastic, whereas the the bridal gown just looked... unfortunate.)

We took the dress up to the front to order it in the color I wanted.  As the pleasant girl at the register was ringing us up, she suffered some confusion about how to enter the commission since I'd informed her that we'd helped ourselves.  One of the ""consultants,"" sweeping by behind her, snapped in an extremely snide tone that she should just put her own name, IT'S FINE.

It was pretty clear to us that a major reason they hadn't had any time for us was that we'd been honest about not really wanting a bridal gown.  Whatever--I really preferred not having someone hovering over me trying to convince me I needed a damn veil or something.

It was annoying, however, when the dress came in ~4 weeks later, they called me, and then couldn't find it for 20 minutes when I came in to pick it up.  Turns out they'd reversed my names in the computer system.  I realize that my first name is unusual, but my surname ends in ""-man""; it shouldn't take a detective to figure out that ""-man"" is generally not a given name kind of ending.  Also, as noted, they sold my name and number to pretty much every wedding vendor in Wisconsin (without any kind of permission, obviously), despite the fact that they have in their records the fact that the wedding is taking place in Nevada.  I couldn't use these vendors even if I wanted to.

The dress itself is nice, and my bridesmaids were able to get the same dress in a different color at this location and locations in Missouri and Massachusetts, so I basically got what I expected out of using them.  I took it elsewhere for alterations, since they're notorious for overcharging for them.

Also, when I came back in to buy a longline bra last month, the store was not at ALL crowded and they still kept me waiting for a ""consultant"" for about 15 minutes--this time, since I couldn't find where they kept the underwear in order to help myself, I had to resort to standing in the middle of the salesfloor glaring at the ceiling in order to get some attention.  I'm almost 30; I assure you that I know how to try on a bra, even a bridal one, but apparently DB doesn't trust me.

And in fact once I managed to get my connection to the stockroom, it was a fairly short process.  The bra cost $80, which is slightly more than half the cost of the dress, but it's well made and that's pretty standard.

tl;dr: The dresses are cheap and you'll probably find something you like, but even if you're already not expecting high-quality service, you should probably lower your expectations even further.",Shopping

I live like 2 mintues from Cyclo and have been wanting to try it for a couple years now.  So my son and I went last night for a little date :o)  We came in and had to use the resetroom first... then were told that we could sit anywhere... so we did, well then we just sat there for like 5 minutes with no menu, no drink order, NOTHING... our waiter was sitting at the table next to us EATING... that's fucking awesome, you take your time, we're not here to dine or anything!

Finally he gives us a menu... takes another snack break with his gramma or whoever?  and some lady with a sour face, maybe his aunt?

finally takes our drink order.  I had the Thai Iced Tea, which wasn't that great... first of all it was ORANGE... never had it this color before and I've had a fair share (cept the one at Saigon Pho was orange too, vietnamese thing???).  I could've ignored the color if the taste was better... we didnt get straws, but then our waiter disappeared for a while and brought back straws from walgreens... without a wrapper on it... DO I REALLY WANT TO USE THE STRAW YOU JUST HAD YOUR DIRTY ASS HANDS ON??

So by this time, I'm thinking we should have just gone to Chino Bandido on the other side of the parking lot.

He finally comes back to take our order, we had the Chicken Wings for an appetizer and decided to share the Pad Thai.

Our wings arrived fairly quickly... they were actually tasty and pretty spicy.  The only thing I didn't really enjoy were the ton of seeds... just not a great mouth feel.

Now something happened that really bugs the crap outta me.  We JUST GOT our wings and had barely taken a couple bites when our entree arrived.  Dont they know about timing?  I dont want my entree yet, I know it might sound picky, but I would really like to enjoy my appetizer and not feel rushed because I dont want my entree to get cold.  Sorry... I know I'm ranting...

So we finished a wing and decided to start on the Pad Thai, which, even though we tried to hurry to it, was kinda cold now, and the noodles were all congealed together in a big lump-o-noodle.
The flavor was good, I liked the shrimp in it too, but Dom and I agreed that the chunks of egg were ""weird"".  I prefer little shreds of egg and I also prefer it to be served on a plate rather than a bowl so that the ""gravy"" keeps the noodles mosty separated instead of in a noodle ball.  Oh, and this version was made with very thin noodles, I prefer the wide noodle for this dish.  Maybe I'm being picky, but that's my right as a patron I guess.

So we kinda picked some more at our food and then Dom had to use the restroom... so he did his thing, and I waited for the bill which took another little while to come even though there were only two other tables occupied. 

Overall, I thought the food was ok, nothing spectacular at all though.  I guess I really had high expectations for Cyclo  - and that mixed with the poor service (just lacked any personality , friendliness, or attentiveness), I just felt let down.

I'll give it another chance in the hopes that the service is better, and perhaps the owner will be there to liven things up?",Restaurant

-Locals Discount
-Using SpaFinder gift cards from Costco
-Staff and Facilities
-Massage and Facial Services
-Comparison to Qua at Caesar's Palace

LOCALS DISCOUNT
The website says locals get 25% off SUN-THURS.  I called the concierge a day in advance to book for Sunday and confirm this information.  When I got to the counter, the receptionist said it was MON-THURS only.  She called her manager who probably told her to just give me the discount because she said it was fine.

SPAFINDER GIFT CARDS
I had a couple issues using them at Spa Mandalay.  I bought $200 worth (4-$50 cards) from Costco for $160.  After my discount, I had a balance of $23.75 which CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THE TIP and their exact words were ""IF YOU DON'T USE IT, YOU LOSE IT.""  I lost it but what I should've done was used $150 worth of the gift cards, kept the last card, and paid the difference out of pocket.  Also, see the section comparing this spa to Qua.

STAFF AND FACILITIES
Staff were attentive and friendly. Loved the two hot tubs and the warm tub.  Sauna was large and the chairs in the quiet room were comfortable.  I went on Sunday when it wasn't very busy but if it was busy, the hot and warm tubs are structured in such a way that no matter where you or your friends are sitting in it, it feels private. Large lockers with keys.  Lots of chairs that surround the tubs.  

MASSAGE AND FACIAL
Sharon gave a great massage!  When I asked for more pressure for my Swedish massage, she gave me something closer to what a deep tissue massage...which was great!  I appreciated that she did not speak much.  Ashlee gave my 25 minute facial which was very relaxing and my tired skin definitely looked radiant afterwards.  My face was so smooth!  One odd thing to note: neither Sharon nor Ashlee consulted me prior to my treatments about areas of concerns or questions I may have had.  I had to interrupt their routine to tell them not to massage my arches or what to expect from my facial.  I felt like I had rudely disrupted their routine by asking questions.  It's ok, the excellent treatments made up for it.

SPA MANDALAY vs. QUA
Here are my votes:
--SpaFinder giftcards: both accept them.  Qua will let you apply the balance of the cards to your tips, whereas SpaMandalay is not so flexible.
--Treatments: Spa Mandalay
--Hot tub: Spa Mandalay, but the Qua baths are cool too. I like the way the Spa Mandalay's tubs are built more so than the Qua ones.
--Sauna: Spa Mandalay's is larger
--Tea, Fruit, and Juices: Qua has pretzels and more drinks in addition to fruit, Spa Mandalay has cucumber water, pineapple cranberry juice, apples, and bananas.
--Size: Qua is more spacious. For large groups or on weekend days, I'd pick Qua.
--Ambience: Spa Mandalay is better lit, more tropical.  Qua is dimmer, better for taking a nap.  I can do with either.
--Qua has additional amenities: Thermal seats (which guests claim early in the morning so I didn't get a chance to try one) and Arctic room (which is cool, but small).
--Location: Both are located near the lobby where valet parking drop off is located.  If you self-parked, you will have to walk through the casino to get to the spa.
--Coed: I think Qua has a Coed area but Spa Mandalay doesn't.  Double check this.

Overall, I wouldn't mind returning to Spa Mandalay now that I have a better understanding of their policies.  I've also been to the Spa & Salon at Aria and the Spa at Red Rock Casino (both of which have smaller hot tubs and saunas but larger co-ed facilities that include a pool\/tub, etc.).",Beauty

I was in Las Vegas celebrating a significant birthday and was looking for a special place to have dinner. Upon reading the multiple positive reviews of this restaurant, I was completely fooled into trying it out. Had I known the quality of the food would be inferior, the customer service would be extremely poor and that I would have to fight with the manager to get a burnt paella dish off of my bill, I would have NEVER EVER visited this restaurant. I wish that I could have gone with my 2nd dining choice of TAO or for that sake, anything else would have been better than dining at Jaleo since I was very dissatisfied and they totally ruined my birthday dinner.

The night was off to a good start with our drinks. We ordered a variety of tapas including Gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas and croquetas de pollo. Though the portions were extremely small for the price of each dish, they were savory and had good flavor. My expectations were high for the grilled skirt steak (carne asada con piquillos) and the black noodle paella with shrimp (Fideua Negra on Calarmares y Gambas). I was hoping these dishes would be heartier because despite having enjoyed the other dishes I was still feeling very hungry. I was disappointed when I saw the small size of the steak that was cut into 4-5 small pieces) and at this time I started to get upset with the small portions and the price for each (just the small steak was $16). I was even more disappointed with the paella because again, not only was the portion small (and $25), the shrimp turned out to be bite sized pieces (like they'd taken a regular size shrimp and cut it into 4 smaller pieces), but the dish was also burnt! We discovered the dish was burned at the bottom because we were all so hungry from not getting our fill from the small portions of the dished we'd already eaten and were digging into the paella trying to eat as much of it as possible. We were only able to eat about half of it because the remainder of the dish was a crusty, burnt mess that was stuck to the bottom of the pan (similar to what would happen when you make rice at home and you don't add enough water and it sticks). When we brought the issue up to the waiter he said ""I do apologize, but we have some new apprentice people in the kitchen"" and asked if we wanted a new dish. We said no because it would take about a half hour to make and by this time, it was close to 11:30 pm. Plus, I was already extremely disappointed with the food and wanted to leave. I told the waiter we were upset by the quality of the food and a few minutes later a manger came to our table to ask if everything was OK. I told her (I believe her name was Andrea) that I was surprised and disappointed that a restaurant of this caliber would be serving food that was burned and of inferior quality. Rather than accepting fault for the obviously burned paella which was at the table, she chastised us and said we should have brought the issue up sooner and that we had probably enjoyed it because we got to the bottom of the pan and that's where the burnt part was. I couldn't believe she was actually making us feel guilty for eating the dish and not bringing it up sooner. She tried to make up for it by bringing me a dessert, however I was celebrating my birthday and in most restaurants, a dessert is complimentary, so I was still not satisfied. 
When our bill came I was furious to see that they were still charging us the $25 for the burned paella. I brought it up to the waiter and he was flustered and didn't know what to do. Again, Andrea came to the table and said she thought they had made good on the burned dish by bringing out the dessert. I told her that I would absolutely NOT pay for the dish that was burned and that I was extremely upset for having dined at this restaurant which I thought would be of much higher quality given its inside one of Vegas's new hotels. After practically having to fight to have them take the dish off of my bill, they did indeed remove the charge, but I was already very upset and felt we had not been given the good quality service we deserved, especially for celebrating my birthday.
Bottom line, I will NEVER EVER return to this place or recommend it to others. Prices are high, portions are very small, customer service was bad and they completely ruined my birthday dinner!",Restaurant

I first came across Ryus Noodle Bar during the Summer of 2014. I was in my last semester of undergrad, in between finals, and I just wanted to eat something before studying again. The little village on Baldwin Street is a place I love a lot because it is quite like Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, except much smaller. There are many Japanese restaurants run by Japanese people (you'd be surprised at how many aren't in Toronto) and the village has some of the best gelato in the city.

As Ryus Noodle Bar was only a short walk from the main campus, I decided to try it out on a whim and I was hooked since. In 2014, the noodle bar was fairly new to Torontonians so it was relatively easy to grab a spot. When I visited a week ago with my husband, it was so popular that we were barely able to secure a spot for the two of us. A waiting list started not so long after we were seated. Talk about great timing!

The availability of ramen here is very unique and creative, which is why I love Ryus Noodle Bar so much! Though not shown here, you can have a variety of oils (even truffle oil) to add to your ramen to really customize it the way you want to. I find the price of the ramen here a little more expensive than other noodle houses in the city, but the price doesn't bother me too much as I prefer quality and creativity over price. Their entire menu is available here on their website, and I think you'd be surprised at how unique their menu is! If I lived in Toronto again, I'd go back to Ryus Noodle Bar in a heartbeat to try their meat platter and other ramen!

Did you know that you can upgrade to the large size for the same price for the Cold Salad Ramen? I opted for the regular size as I didn't think I could finish the large one, but if you have a big appetite, I'd definitely recommend that you go for the large size.

The salad ramen has a variety of fresh toppings, from mushrooms, chicken, slow cooked pork, and much more. The noodles are very well cooked despite being cold and it is very chewy in texture just how it should be. There is a dipping sauce that it comes with (sweet chili & sesame), and it is very much like a salad dressing in flavour. I suppose you can choose between dipping your noodles in the sauce bowl or you can pour the dipping sauce over the salad ramen like me. There is no proper way of eating it (at least I think - correct me if I'm wrong please!:D) and it's delicious and healthy no matter how you eat it.

My husband decided to try their spicy miso ramen which was very hot indeed as he opted for extra spiciness. The broth was very thick (probably the extra chili flakes!) but tasty. The ramen came with a side of dipping oil. There were 5 types of dipping oils to choose from, and hubby decided to go with what our waiter recommended (garlic oil) and it definitely added another layer of flavour in the ramen. The only downside there was to the spicy miso ramen was that it was rather too hot even for us Koreans. We don't recommend opting for the super hot (4 chilis) because it really is too spicy and it slightly takes away the authentic flavours of the ramen.

Another reason why I like Ryus Noodle Bar is that it has more than just your average miso, pork and chicken broths. Here, the traditional Japanese broth is also available, made with shiitake mushrooms and kombu which is edible kelp. These two ingredients are also very commonly used  in Korean cuisine to make broth for many soups!

So, if you're a lover of ramen and you haven't tried Ryus Noodle Bar yet, you definitely should give them a visit. They have a great patio as well as many tables inside so if the weather is nice, their outdoor patio is a good option. Their service is consistently great; the workers are all very friendly, polite and helpful. The food does take a little longer than other places and as I've mentioned before, it is a bit more expensive than other ramen restaurants. Overall, the uniqueness of Ryus Noodle Bar is what draws me back everytime. I can't wait to be back when I'm back in T-dot!",Restaurant

The first part of my review will be about the timeshare! First off with my initial booking with the representative over the phone he lured me into the offer by   Telling me I would be staying at  the Elara Hilton which is attached to the  planet Hollywood and he described how it's recently built modern and conveniently located to the strip with all the shops and just made it sound so appealing so I accepted the offer, and told him I was a family of 6 and he assured me the suite would be accommodating for such a family size so I booked my stay a week later. When  I received my confirmation email I noticed the address was totally different from the Elara so I called spoke to someone who was very rude by the way and wasn't sincere at all about my situation so I asked to speak to someone else once they transferred me I spoke to another woman who explained the Elara had no available rooms for my dates and even if there were rooms available I would have to pay over $100 to switch! How is that my fault that I was lured in by false pretenses and would have to pay for what I was told I would initially get? So I just left my reservation as is and as she was going over my confirmation with me she said this stay for  2 adults and 2 children, I explained to her I had 4 children and she then informed me I would have to pay an additional $58 a night to upgrade to an extra bedroom suite because it would be a fire hazard to have that many people in one room! I couldn't believe it because when I initially booked the room I specifically told the guy I had 4 children. So when I explained this to her she very rudely just said ok well I'll just cancel the whole reservation then! Um excuse me, I already requested my time off work and planned accordingly for this trip and my children were expecting it I can't just cancel the whole thing! Well I agreed to pay for the upgrade at a ""discounted rate"" and was done! So that was just another way for them to make more money off of me!  As far as the timeshare presentation It did last 90 minutes but the representative we spoke with was a little odd but not pushy about purchasing 
Now here are the pros and cons of my experience with the actual hotel 
PROS: *The suite was very roomy, and accommodating with a full kitchen, utensils, dishes, and washer dryer
*The hotel is non smoking which is great when you have children 
*In order to use the elevators to get up to your room you must scan your card room key so it's an added bonus for comfort 
*There is a playroom with pool table (which is not in very good condition though because every time you made a ball in the whole pocket would fall right to the floor) there's a ping pong table, video games, television, couches, table, chairs, and DVDs rental kiosks
*Starbucks in deli 

CONS: *Self parking PER DAY is $8 and $13 for valet 
*The carpet in our room was horribly sticky and dirty we couldn't even walk barefoot because our feet would be filthy 
*The market deli located downstairs is very pricey and doesn't accept cash everything must be charged to your room
*For one pizza I paid $18.95 room service not only charges a delivery fee of $5.95 but an extra $2 fee for service charge! So that's about $27 for one medium pizza If they would have told me that I would have just ordered from an outside pizza source  FYI, it was a horrible tasting pizza 
*The hot water ran out pretty quickly after only 2 showers
*check out time is 10am :\/",Beauty
ydgwfKsWoOcIBXcvKpKeDQ,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,2007-09-23,"There are two distinct kinds of friends who have given me their accounts of Haji Baba, a long-time Middle Eastern culinary institution in Tempe: Arizona natives\/ASU alums, and Middle Easterners.

Arizona natives\/ASU alums: Why do you go to all these other Middle Eastern places? Haji Baba is the best! The best, I tell you. Are you even listening to me? It's awesome! And cheap! I'd go there after Econ 102 every Tuesday and Thursday. No need to go to any of these other places, see? Haji Baba is the best. Now, go!

Middle Easterners: My friend, why do you want to go here? How is it, you ask me? Meh. It is just ok food. They give you a lot of food, but nothing tasting very special, you know? If you go here, just do your shopping and eat somewhere else.

And with those distinct camps of opinion, it's no wonder that it took 21 months for me to set foot in here. But I finally did so a few nights ago...

Haji Baba is another store\/restaurant hybrid, which seems to be the M.O. of most Middle Eastern establishments here in the Valley. The store, to the left-hand side, had a pretty good-sized selection of Middle Eastern goods, except you can obviously tell that this place is right by a college campus, with the near-entirety of one long shelving unit dedicated to every flavor of hookah tobacco known to man. I didn't spot a durian, rhubarb, or garlic-flavored tobacco during my initial scan, but I'm sure they were in there somewhere.

The separate dining area is to the right, except for two small tables on the store-side of the wall. Which is where the waiter decided to seat me, even though there were open tables of equal size in the dining area. I thought this was a little odd. Was I being sequestered for some reason? I didn't think I looked disheveled, but what do I know. 

Anyway, I ordered some baba ganoush with pita for appetizer and then the chicken shawarma combination plate for entree. I'll agree about the prices. They did seem very reasonable (the combination plate was $6-something). Also, they had choices of either Arabic-style or Persian-style kabobs, which I pretty much never see in the same restaurant. 

As I waited for my food, I was given a tall, frosted plastic cup full of ice water. The problem was, though, that the cup was so tall that my accompanying straw completely disappeared as soon as I dropped it in. Oh well.

My baba ganush arrived and it looked really great. However, the taste was so mild that you could barely distinguish it from hummus. You'd have no inkling whatsoever that this was eggplant mush. It had none of the smoky, slightly bitter flavor that baba ganush is known for. Which is fine. Maybe milder, meeker, less potentially offensive flavors are the way to go in a college setting, but I was a little disappointed.

Then came my chicken shawarma entree, which had a sizeable pile of the aforementioned chicken plus hummus, tabbouleh, rice, and more pita. I could see how as a college student that this would be a great value. Even as a working professional, this was still good value. In front of me was a lot of food for not much money. They were generous with the amount of chicken they gave, a rare sight in many of these restaurants. But again, hoping for amazing things, I was underwhelmed by the taste of each of the elements. Not that any of the items tasted bad, but that their flavors were more muted than other Middle Eastern establishments I've been to in the Valley, which I can say now is more than a small handful. 

That said, Haji Baba did succeed in one thing - too *much* food. I was so full that I left with a lot of my rice and pita left over, which pretty much never happens. 

So in the end, what do I make of this crowded, local ASU favorite? 

5 words: It is ok, my friend.

This was my first trip to The Liberty.  I went early evening (just before 5) with 2 girlfriends for after work TGIF drinks, apps, meals, desserts.  It was easy to spot right off of South Blvd.  Parking was plentiful, as we were quite early.  It's a well-paved, well-lit lot.  As we left around 7:30 or so, the lot was quite full, but this is right next to Pewter Rose and a gay bar (?) that I seem to remember reading about on the local paper online edition, and they share the large-ish lot. 

We sat at a booth in the bar area.  It's a large bar with high chairs and 2 big flat screen TVs.  It has several high-top tables to accommodate large groups or smaller 4-top tables, and had 4 booths against the windows so you can view the traffic\/walkers on South Blvd and the people coming in and out of Fuel Pizza.  If you like men in uniform, the fire station is directly across the street, so that is nice, but the sirens may also cause some beer spillage.  Once it is time for ambiance, they dim the lights, so make sure you have an app installed on your smart-phone that serves as a flashlight.  You will also need this if you have to go to the restroom directly behind the hostess stand, it's a dark hallway and hard to see exactly where you are going.  It's also a one-person restroom, so if you like to have meetings in the ladies room, you will be disappointed.  Comfy seating in the booths.

The drinks... wide selection of beer and wine.  My dinner dates had some kind of seasonal pumpkin ale.  They said it was good.  I had a Diet Pepsi.  (y u no serve Coke?).

The food.... we ordered fried pickles and pretzels with spicy mustard and\/or cheese fondue for dipping as appetizers.  The fried pickles were very crispy and served with a ranch sauce and a tobasco\/hot wing sauce, they tasted very good - I liked the crispness of the pickles and the pickles themselves tasted good.  I tried the wing sauce, wasn't a fan and stuck with the ranch.  The pretzels were VERY good.  Served warm with a sprinkling of salt with a cheese fondue that was creamy and delicious.  I am not a fan of spicy mustard, but I did try it.  It was mildly spicy.  And it was mustard.  (go for the cheese!)

For entrees, two of us got the pub burger which was a nice-sized burger that was flavored well and juicy, served with bacon, cheddar, grilled balsamic onions, lettuce, maters and aioli with a pickle stabbed on top of it on a brioche bun.  This will be a knife and fork burger after the first bite - it goes everywhere - I felt like I was covered in beef juice and mayo (that's what she said).  Typically served with french fries with rosemary, parmesan and chives, I asked them to skip all of that crap and just put salt on my fries.  The fries were hand cut and tasted very good - crispy without being hard with a nice fresh flavor (think Five Guys with a flair).  Our other dining companion had the BBQ sammich, again served with fries, and she said it was quite good as well.  It looked good and was a large sandwich.

Dessert.... we split a chocolate walnut torte served with chocolate sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.  Very good!  It tasted like a light chocolate cake with walnuts in it, served warm.  

Service was... well... mediocre at best.  The waitress was friendly without being annoying when we saw her.  When we first arrived, we were one of maybe 3 tables there and it seemed that they were staffed well enough to handle 3 tables.  Empty glasses stayed empty for a while, and from appetizers to ordering dinner was an eternity.  While the service wasn't bad, it was inattentive for the number of people that were seated.  They would have sold quite a bit more beer to our table had she been a little more attentive.  However she was pleasant and did seem to know the menu relatively well even though from other reviews and what she said, the menu changes quite often.  

The food was good, but because the service was slightly lacking, The Liberty would not be my first choice for a meal, but if someone wanted to go, I would not say no.  Try it out!",Restaurant
-DB_dn6OzsH6pl79Gp5JRw,lstlOQgPI-HEmvf85yAA5A,JALVUxCfmv33jPhO7fLNHQ,2016-12-24,"Attention recently engaged couples, this is a review of Old Mill Toronto as a wedding venue.

Pros:
-They are open for consultation on weekends, even on a Sunday. 
-Having done thousands (if not tens of thousands) of couples' weddings to date, they are relatively organized and they offer a standard service. During the consultation, we were given a nice folder with checklists. We were also given a tour of the chapel as well as a number of rooms that would fit our expected number of guests.
-Great location if your guests are mostly coming from the GTA; the Old Mill is also accessible by public transportation with a TTC stop, Old Mill station. 
-Beautiful and cozy atmosphere
-Easy to arrange for other services, in particular, the organist was awesome! He arranged for other musicians to join him and play for our ceremony. 
-Complimentary room was provided so we could do a Chinese tea ceremony before the reception.
-They assign you a Captain on your wedding day. You won't find out who that will be until the morning of your wedding, but it's super helpful to have this ""wedding coordinator"" from the Old Mill even if you have your own. 

Cons:
-Somewhat disorganized and not detail-oriented catering manager: she made a lot of mistakes in the documents including estimates. We understand that things are not going to be perfect, but we would expect that they would not make silly mistakes such as referring to my fiancé as a Ms. so-and-so. This mistake appeared again despite telling her the first time to correct it. She provided estimates with an incorrect number of guests, incorrect pricing (we had to point out that the beef option was actually more costly than the chicken option). She also forgot to tell us about other random fees such as chair cover fee and coat check fee. We found out about them just before payments were due. In another instance, she gave me a wrong phone number to one of the Ministers who provides his service in association with the Old Mill. I called the number and the person on the other line is like what? I'm not a Minister, lol.  
-""I don't care"" approach from the Minister, arranged via the Old Mill: after finally getting the right phone number to one of the Ministers, I called him. He told me it's another one that will be doing weddings for the month our wedding was in. I called this other one, and he sounded like a nice person to preside over our ceremony. I was really looking forward to it; then, this other Minister called me back and said it's actually yet another Minister that would be helping us for our ceremony. After being transferred from one Minister to another, I felt like we weren't being cared for at all. The Minister responsible for us eventually called me and said he was on vacation and that he could not book our rehearsal, so we waited and waited until he would contact us again. After more than a month had passed, he still did not reply to our email or gave us a call. He showed basically no interest at all in learning about us or guiding us with this marriage process. We really wanted some guidance because we wanted to be prepared for the ceremony. He only provided us with this email containing reading materials to review by ourselves. I was pretty disappointed with this level of indifference shown by the Minister, and we considered finding another Minister, but eventually, he did arrange the rehearsal and we were hopeful that in-person interaction might turn out to be better. For the actual ceremony, the Minister did do an amazing job with his deep, penetrating voice. He was flexible and allowed us to do the ceremony the way we wanted to. I'm glad that it turned out to be a happy ending after all.  
-Need to pay the full balance almost three weeks before the ceremony: we were asked to pay the balance in full almost three weeks before our ceremony. This may be a standard practice with wedding venues, but I wish they were more flexible and asked for the final guest numbers and payment closer to our wedding day, since it's not like they would be preparing the food weeks before our ceremony, anyway. They should also know that some guests may back out last minute.
-Other: we weren't told in advance that having the maximum number of people for a room meant we could not fit in a Photo Booth or a photo slideshow projector. During the reception, we decided to go with Old Mill's music in the room, and they forgot to turn it on, so we had to remind the Captain. In addition, watch out for silly little fees such as beef up-charge, caking cutting, coat check, parking pass, chair cover fees and so on.",Beauty

2 stars for the venue

For the past year, we've seen these painting parties popping up everywhere and finally got a chance to try one out.  It also helped that they were having a Groupon promotion too.

Vegas Painting Parties has events at various restaurants.  You can preview their calendar to see what location works best for you and what painting you'll be doing too.  (Their usual spots are Havana Grill, Nacho Daddy, Republic Kitchen and Bar, Violas Tavern, and Streets of New York.)

This past Saturday evening, we headed to Nacho Daddy for their Red Umbrella painting party.  They use the private room in the back, so you can come early and order food and drinks.  Your dinner will arrive as you're painting, so that's a nice perk.

There were many things happening that made this venue not the most ideal spot for painting.  First off, it's pretty crowded.  Other guests commented that they had been to other painting parties where they just had more space.  I bumped into the Husband a few times while painting and he almost knocked over his water cup.  And my poor easel kept sliding and bumping into the person's canvas directly across from me.  The wait staff had to squeeze through to drop off any food for the painters.  The next problem was the air condition, or lack of.  With about 30 people in the room, it was getting hot in there and the restaurant staff really couldn't do anything about turning up the air condition.  It wasn't until after I suggested leaving the doors open to the main restaurant did we finally get some much needed cooler air into the room.  The third and probably worst problem was the lighting.  We were seated by the windows and initially opened the blinds to get some natural light.  As the sun set, you found our whole row using our cell phone flashlights to paint.  It looked ridiculous and it just was.  We asked the restaurant staff about lighting and the two fixtures behind us that resembled lamps were decorative.  Most of our phones died before the end of class.

The class itself was fun and Diane was our instructor.  She was thorough and really did everything step by step.  It was a bit hard to see her at times because of where I was seated.  She did go around with her painting so you could see up close what she did, but the poor lighting didn't help here.

The paintbrushes were okay.  There was a lot of highlighting in this particular painting and it was impossible to get our paintbrushes thin enough to make a fine line.  At the end of the night, I realized that my thin paintbrush was actually bigger than some of the others.  So, something to also pay attention for.

At the end of the class, they gave away a free painting party class good for two people.  So that was a nice ending.  They also made a point of taking pictures throughout the night and at the end with your final product (if you so desired) so they could post on their facebook site.  This three hour class was utilized to the end, and so I wonder how those two hour painting parties work.  (Someone else mentioned that this particular piece was more complicated than others she's seen, so maybe that's how.)

Would we do this again? Sure! It's normally $35 per person, which appears to be the standard going rate around Vegas. I wouldn't do it at this venue again though, maybe a daytime one would be alright.  We're already signed up for another one this week at another company.

Erica is the owner and I communicated with her through phone and text. I wasn't able to use my Groupon before it expired and she was flexible with extending the date which I thought was awesome. I was able to book our actual date through text so that made it easy too.  Their classes do fill up, so you definitely need to check their calendar for updates.

Suggestion: If you do decide to go to Nacho Daddy for the evening painting class, be sure to get there early and sit in the middle, directly underneath the main light fixture.  This will change your experience completely.",Shopping

When was the last time you saw Michael Jordan at a Denny's?  That's right, never.  Although doesn't Shaq or Magic Johnson own a few of them?  Can't remember.

I like this Denny's location much better than the one closest to my home.  This one is bigger and the décor is a bit more inviting.  Service seems quicker & more hospitable.  Plus this Denny's turns over people at an alarming rate, especially on a weekend morning.  Long wait lines disappear pretty quick!

Not that I eat breakfast at Denny's all that often.  And really, Denny's for the most part is synonymous with breakfast.  I look at the lunch & dinner menu and I just shake my head.  Why oh why does it seem like it caters to older (much older) people?  Not saying it's bad, but just seems so old-fashioned!  So, I just stick with the breakfast stuff.  

I like cheap, and when I want an OK breakfast for chump change & am sick of $1 breakfast sausage burritos from McDonald's, I end up at Denny's.  Yeah, you go to their regular breakfast menu and some of that stuff costs you a few fingers!  More than $12 for some of their damn omelets!  $10 for a friggin' breakfast sandwich!  Unbelievable!  So I go with the little, all the way in the back of the book, value menu.  Get items priced at $2, $4, $6, and $8!  More my style!  Save the rest of that money for some Lipitor prescription later.

I often opt for the $4 Everyday Value Slam - its got 2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (I go with sunny side up), and either 2 bacon strips or 2 sausage links (I usually ask for 1 bacon strip & 1 sausage link).  All you need for a growing middle-aged man!  

But this particular morning I was feeling extra manly and won a gangbusters of cash the night before at the casino...went home with $20 profit WOOT WOOT!  Changed that sucker for all $1's homey!  I felt like ballin' so I went with the BIG bad boy - the $8 Grand Slam Slugger!  2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (over easy this time), 2 bacon strips AND 2 sausage links yo!  With a side of well-done hash browns, baby!  Plus it includes an endless cup of coffee AND a small cup of juice...orange for me, boi!  Breakfast just got BIG PIMPIN'!

Felt like a million bucks eating this thing!  Pancakes were light & fluffy not to mention drenched in butter & warm syrup, dippin' my bacon into the runny egg yolk & ketchup just like I like to do, even the damn coffee was pipin' hot & fresh like Beyoncé's backside (yeah I got 99 problems but hash browns ain't one).  Don't forget the Cholula!  But whoa, had to knock it down a star because of the cholesterol overload!  Halfway through I was boggin' down, this Grand Slam Slugger ain't no joke!  Watch out, it'll put you down for the count!  Just too rich!  I felt like I needed some kind of vegetation on my plate to counter all of the oily goodness.  Even a piece of parsley would have been good to gnaw on.  Ended up taking a to-go box with about 1\/4 of the Slugger left.  Be forewarned - cold, rubbery pancakes make bad, BAD leftovers.

Great bargain for all the food & drink you get!  The $8 Grand Slam Slugger from Denny's will be my go to breakfast meal from now on, except I'll probably end up sharing it with the wifey.  Yeah, 2 for 1!  Save that money!  For Lipitor & a crossfit membership!  No joke.

I had made rezzies at Petite Maison via Open Table on Yelp. Parking is on the street or their nearby parking lot. As we walked up to the hostess' table, she was able to show us to our seats. Although the restaurant offers outdoor patio dining, we opted to dine inside to experience dining in this cute, kitschy restaurant.

*ESCARGOT ($11 for 6 pieces, **3.5 STARS**)
I was expecting to shell out the escargot from it's shell! But actually, the escargot was already pulled from it's casing and baked within an individual baking dish full of melted butter and seasonings. The dish was served piping hot (especially the plate itself) along with two slices of warm, toasted baguette. The escargot was delightful, rich and tender. The warm buttery sauce it was baked in, encapsulated every crevice and gave a lot of oomph to the escargot itself. Definitely a dish worth trying! I kinda wish though I had the fun of shelling out the escargot from it's shell, but at the same time I'm kinda glad I didn't have to get down and dirty for it! 

*FOIE GRAS ($18, **4 STARS**)
Was OMG! Mouth-watering, delicious and worth every penny! For those of you who are unfamiliar with foie, it's duck liver fat. The French would feed the ducks corn (in this case we knew the ducks were free-range and came from a decent place). The foie gras was seared and tasted like it was a piece of steak! As you cut into a piece of the seared foie, you got a piece of fat, which glistened within the light. Add a piece of the paired cranberry chutney, cider glaze and savory donut, this dish was mesmerizing! I do concur that it's worth ordering as this dish is what the restaurant is known for! GET 'EM!!!! 

*BOULLIABAISE ($33, **3 STARS**)
A saffron base sauce was made with fresh mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops and halibut. The seafood was cooked quite well and everything was tender. The seafood was fresh! The base of the sauce was simple and not too salty. Not the best nor the worst, but pretty decent in my humble opinion.

*POISSON ($28, **1 STAR**)
A seared piece of halibut was cooked well. I liked that there was a nice ""sear"" within the fish and it was light and flaky. The only downfall to this dish is that the lobster risotto was not executed correctly. First and foremost, the risotto was so soupy that it wasn't thick in consistency as risotto should be. In addition, after one bite of the risotto, it was quite grainy - as if the rice was not yet cooked!!!!! After flagging down our waitress, she apologized for the mistake and was embarrassed for such a thing happening. 

The dish was sent back to the kitchen to be corrected. After several minutes, the risotto was served. Not only did it taste slightly better, BUT it was still grainy because the risotto was not cooked well..... AND it was still soupy! Unfortunately, it was the risotto that had made the halibut a lackluster as it was not paired well together. I didn't want to embarrass the waitress again and send back the dish, but accepted it as what it was. 

Service (**5 STARS**) was phenomenal from our waitress. I liked the fact that she shared recommendations of what to devour since it was our first time visiting the restaurant. She even shared a few corny jokes, which made our evening fun despite the risotto fail. She apologized sincerely for the mistake and was happily to correct the error. 

Overall, Petite Maison is a decent French restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. But I've had better French food in Portland, that this place doesn't really compare! If I were to come back to Petite Maison, I would probably only order the FOIS GRAS again. I had heard their dessert is good as well. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled by Portlandia, BUT for what it's worth, Petite Maison is A-OK in my book!

heSMJ_VLVDaFEVG9dKbL9g,NDfcFPPzHqvnCu9rEg2GfA,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,2014-09-03,"My actual experience here is more of a 3.5, but I'm rounding up.  

First the good: Despite being in a strip mall, the restaurant has successfully turned the interior into a nice dining space and even has comfortable looking outdoor seating for those times it's cool enough to sit outside.

The waitstaff was great - friendly, professional, there when we needed them, gone when we didn't.  We were a group of ten, and when we arrived they had set up a long table in a smaller section of the restaurant which gave us more privacy.

Food portions were reasonable, and the menu was well rounded.  The only drawback was the food itself.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either, and at these prices you'd expect something better.

I started with the wood oven baked prawns, which I asked to come out as my side with dinner since no one else was having an appetizer.  They came out ahead of the meal despite my request, and were fine but not spectacular.  Fifteen dollars got you four prawns.  The prawns themselves were incredibly fresh tasting, however they picked up almost none of the flavor of the seasonings.  I ended up using the sauce to dip my bread, just so I could taste it.

The roasted cauliflower was described as good - in fact it got one member of our party to change their mind about cauliflower - and the mac & cheese was tasty as long as you didn't get a bite with a piece of pepper (too spicy).

The bread - oh my god, the bread.  This may have been the best part of the meal.  Our server brought out plenty: fresh made rolls, baked together in little stars, and Parmesan flavored crisp flat bread, all served with a light whipped butter with black sea salt.  When we quickly ate our way through the first batch our server was happy to bring out more.  

For my main course I had the caramelized sea scallops ($31 for five scallops).  The scallops were nicely darkened on the outside and just slightly overcooked on the inside, but not to the point where it affected the flavor or texture.  These were deliciously sweet and large enough to be a decent main course.  They came with charred cauliflower (poorly seasoned - but better when dipped in the leftover sauce from my appetizer); vanilla bean cauliflower puree (delicious, but overpowering on the scallops so I'm not sure what it was supposed to be eaten with); and truffle sauce (mmm mmm good).

The desert offerings looked delicious, but I chose a tea instead.  My friends who had the chocolate ice cream and the strawberry shortcake both described them as good, but not great. 

Overall the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, great staff, and good ingredients.  Now they just need a chef who can live up to the rest.",Restaurant
cswaq7vzlYvGWoDUJSGOUA,iwDP-y8NJG3Vem2z242LDg,l07ctcrDMV--TYwe3uzebQ,2014-01-19,"This place has got a lot going for it: their food is fresh, they're open 24 hours, the menu is extensive, and so far they're doing quite well judging by the long wait during peak meal times. I heard different stories about the ownership but the main thing is that they were associated with Im Ga Nae in North York once upon a time, which was also a 24-hour joint. I recognized our waitress as one who used to serve us at Im Ga Nae too! One reviewer mentioned that the samgyupsal (pork belly) was cut thinner than at other BBQ restos, and that was actually something I did NOT like about Im Ga Nae, so hopefully they'll cut that nonsense out as I am sure one day I will end up here wanting samgyupsal at 4am and will be thoroughly disappointed if they bring me a plate of bacon-thin slices of meat!

While waiting in line, you get a pretty good idea of the range of different dishes on offer: BBQ, soups, stews, noodles, rice dishes, etc. The food must be pretty damn good as I saw one table of three super-thin girls order enough food for at least eight people! There was barely enough room to place all this endless amount of food! Note that portions are pretty big, and as one other reviewer mentioned, the menu prices do include the tax so don't be alarmed. You're definitely getting your money's worth here. You also get a range of banchan (side dishes) which can vary from day to day. 

After waiting about 20 minutes for a seat, we ended up at a table where we had to sit cross-legged, traditional styles, which would not have been my first choice, but I didn't want to wait to eat any longer. You get these faux-Gucci cushions to sit on but apart from that, there is very little comfort to be gained by sitting and eating this way. Some people don't mind, I guess. My legs tend to fall asleep when I sit for too long like this and stretching them out while eating means someone is going to get kicked. 

We ordered the jummulluk (non-marinated marbled beef) for two ($40) which came with a small choice of soups--we opted for the soondubu--two bowls of purple rice, and of course, an array of banchan. The soondubu was not at all spicy and contained mostly seafood, kimchi, and soft tofu. The broth had a very seafood-y flavor, moreso than when you order seafood soondubu in other restos. The waitress remembered me from Im Ga Nae and made sure they threw in some extra beef, which was cool as it was pretty delish. We enjoyed everything we ordered, and it appeared that other diners did too. What we got could have easily fed three people! The place was rammed with mostly Korean families and visa students the night we went but there was also a smattering of others. And the wait staff do speak English so not to worry. 

Service is good but when it's really busy, you may have to wait a little longer for things. The place is pretty cramped--it used to be Urraca which for some reason I remember being bigger than this? Maybe with the different layout, it seemed bigger, or maybe it was all the fluffy winter coats all over the place that made me feel suffocated, I don't know, but space can be a little cramped. This applies also to surface space for your food--especially if you order BBQ or chunggol, which I suppose is normal, but we had to leave our lettuce wraps and a couple of other things on the ledge next to where we sat. I was afraid something would fall over and land in someone's shoes if someone were to walk by too swiftly! Either way, check this place out--anytime! Just remember not to wear something too nice if you're ordering BBQ as you will be grilling it at your table.",Restaurant

Although he had never eaten there personally, he had heard it was an old-style LV steakhouse and a throwback to the Rat Pack and Mafia days.

I had called ahead to make a reservation as suggested.  I was surprised upon arrival that the restaurant has no access for the disabled.  There are 3 steps up to the door and once inside there are 2 steps down.  I guess they are grandfathered under some old regulations.  They also had no secure spot for my scooter so I had to leave it on the floor of the casino near the poker pit.

The inside of the restaurant lived up to the old LV steakhouse decor.  Red velvet chairs and booths, dim lighting, white tablecloths with candles, waiters in tuxedos, and Sinatra music in the background.

The menu featured Steaks, chops, seafood, and the usual fare--and all a la carte.  Steaks averaged $40-$45 depending on the cut.

Now to the meal.  I ordered coffee, and it was served hot and with half-and-half as ordered.  When I put the cream into my coffee, it curdled.  I asked the waiter for a new cup and fresh cream, and it was promptly delivered with a comment that they checked the carton, and the half-and-half still had 1 day to expiration.  One day or not, it curdled, and I could care less for the explanation.

Upon looking at the menu, I had chosen the Crab Cakes appetizer ($17), and the large cut Prime Rib main course.  As I am on dialysis and can't eat potatoes, I asked if there could be a different accompaniment on the Crab Cakes (served over mashed potatoes), and a vegetable instead of potato with the Prime Rib.

The waiter responded that the Chef does noy allow substitutions.  Given my medical issue, I asked the waiter to check with the Chef who stood firm.  So I canceled the Crab Cakes and ordered a Caesar Salad instead.  I was by myself, and the tableside Caesar was for a minimum of 2 so I asked the waiter to separate the portions into 2--one for an appetizer and one to accompany my Prime Rib as a side.

As a single, I was put in a corner table in a little alcove which was so small that the waiter could not bring the cart over for a tableside salad so he mixed it about 25 feet away and brought it over---in one big bowl.  So much for splitting the portions.  I had to ask for anchovies as they were not offered.

The chef would also not substitute a vegetable for a potato with the Prime Rib so I went without.

When the Prime Rib was delivered, it could have been a picture from a book on Prime Rib, and it was so tender that the knife just sailed right through it.  Then I tasted it.  It had absolutely NO flavor!  I was chewing on beef that was poorly seasoned and didn't even taste of beef.  After 3 bites, I called the waiter over and told him my problem.  He apologized and offered to bring something else.  I ordered the NY Strip, medium.

About 5 minutes later, the restaurant manager came over to tell me the Chef advises that there is nothing wrong with his Prime Rib, and they would be happy to cook a new steak, but my Prime Rib would remain on the check.  Alternatively, they could return my Prime Rib to me.

I told the manager that I had come for dinner, I intended to eat, I wanted the NY Strip, and I had no intention whatsover of paying for the inedible Prime Rib no matter what the Chef thought.  

So I asked, ""How do we overcome this?""  The manager offered to call the ""Operations Manager"" to override the Chef.  Ten minutes later he returned that the ""Operations Manager"" had  removed the Prime Rib from my bill.  The questions here are, Why didn't the manager make that call before he chose to upset a customer, and what kind of ego does this chef have?

During the interchanges with the Manger, a table of 4 was seated next to me.  They had overheard the discussions and kept sending the waiter away when he came to take their orders.  After the Manger advised they were taking the Prime Rib off, they ordered.  The wife told me they had overheard, and if they didn't do the right thing, they would have left.  Good for them!

When my NY Strip was delivered, it was puple raw in the middle and had to be sent back for a re-fire.  What I got back was an overcooked piece of rubber, but I ate it (and paid for it) to avoid further issues.

When I want pancakes, I go to the Pancake House.  When I want waffles, I go to the Waffle House.  When I want a steak, I go to a Steakhouse.  If you can't cook a steak Medium in a Steakhouse, you need to get out of the business.

Overall, the waiter, assistant waiter, and busboy service was good.  The restaurant and food was not, and that's why I would not go back or recommend this place. 

If you really MUST eat here, be sure to stop by the Tix4Tonight booth at the entrance of the casino.  They sell dining discount coupons for $3.00.  At Bill's the coupon disount was 50% off an entree.",Restaurant
S6o7zgiqNt9BSSuo9eEuSg,rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,2014-07-15,"This review is strictly regarding brunch - I've not ever dined at Honey Salt for dinner.

This was also my 1st time at the restaurant and I really didn't know what to expect.  I met a friend for brunch on a Sunday morning. She was seated first, since she was a bit early, and I arrived shortly after.  We we were seated on the side of the restaurant, away from the main dining room.  I found this strange, but my friend mentioned that it was very hot in the restaurant when she walked in, and the hostess recommended sitting over there because it was cooler (I didn't notice the heat).

First of all, I love the decor and vibe of this place.  It's very ""shabby chic."" There are lots of little knick knacks displayed throughout the restaurant and cute art on the walls.

The tables are very close to each other. Luckily, there was nobody seated next to us, so this wasn't an issue.  But I could see it being awkward if it were a busy night.

I was torn between ordering the bottomless mimosas ($20) or the ""create your own"" bloody marys ($22). Once I decided on the bloodys, the server actually talked me out of it - saying that they were much smaller than just ordering them individually, and I would have to do all the work (obviously). I wish I would've just ordered this, but our server convinced me that the bartender makes an awesome bloddy mary (I am very picky about them).  I ended up disappointed. There was just something ""off"" about the drink - it had very little flavor, and although I asked for it to be spicy and also made with horseradish, it wasn't spicy enough and I had the server bring me extra horseradish. Maybe because it was fresh horseradish? I don't know. For my 2nd drink, I ordered the blood orange mimosa, which was very good. 

For food, we started out with the monkey bread. It was a large portion, definitely enough to share ($9). We didn't come close to eating it all! I am not really a sweets person, so I only had a couple of bites.

I was set on ordering the weekend frittata, but my friend changed her mind at the last minute and also decided to order it. So I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict ($22). This was absolutely delicious! There were 2 house made crab cakes, topped with asparagus, 2 poached eggs and hollandaise.  I tasted the frittata and it was also really good! It was much larger than expected and had tons of flavor. She chose to pay $2 extra and add chicken, which I probably wouldn't have done. 

We splurged and had dessert (YOLO, right?!). We shared the Triple Strawberry Shortcake. It looked more like a large biscuit, halved and filled with strawberries and whipped cream. It also had a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  Not sure I would order it again, but as I mentioned I am not a huge sweets eater.

Our server was friendly and helpful. She had a fun, upbeat attitude which is always a plus.  Brunch was good, but there was nothing that wowed me so much that I would drive to the other side of town for.  But I am definitely glad to check another bookmark off my never ending list!",Restaurant
Xdpuae6Fi0zpBu0AyqBJLg,pphrt7iAXMjg8QqLHHUA2Q,2D3IgP6Bu28GxoNXBrChaQ,2014-11-06,"My review must be prefaced with the statement that Walgreens is one of my favorite stores.  From the unbelievable candy selection to the unique revolving inventory during each major holiday, this corner drugstore has a little bit of everything.  If you can get past the ocean of blue hair and the overpowering aroma of Ben-Gay, Walgreens is a great place to kill some time.  Who hasn't spent 30-45 minutes wondering the gleaming, waxy aisles, checking out the ""As Seen On TV"" swag, thumbing through corny greeting cards, and perusing the $5 ""collectible"" figurines?  

But this particular Walgreens is a lump of coal in the shimmering sea of diamonds that this iconic chain of pharmacies has grown to become.

Let's start with the ridiculous parking lot.  IF you're lucky enough to find an open space close to the entrance, you better hope you've played enough Frogger to avoid the fleet of amateur Jeff Gordon's racing across the asphalt.  Otherwise, be prepared to park behind the building, where a few poorly-lit parking spaces just scream ""MUG ME HERE!""  Too few, tightly packed spots make shopping at this location a major inconvenience.

Once inside, the store is just like every other Walgreens you've ever been in - with one discerning and disconcerting difference. This particular Walgreens is staffed by some of the rudest, least-helpful people that have ever darkened the registers in the history of retail sales.

I walked up and down the aisles more than 5 times, passed no less than 4 employees (I went by one employee 3 separate times), looking for a specific product.  Not once was I greeted nor was I asked if I needed assistance finding something.  When I finally got tired of trying to find this item myself, I asked one of the staff where in the store I could find this particular product.  Without saying a word, she let out a loud, heavy sigh and began walking away.  I wasn't sure if I'd insulted her, inconvenienced her, or if I just smelled bad and she was filling her lungs so she could hold her breath while she was in my presence.  But like a good puppy, I followed behind her and was led directly to the item I was looking for.  I muttered a half-hearted ""Thank you,"" to which I received nothing in return.  She sighed again, and without a single word, she went about her duties. 

I approached the counter, and once again, was met by another employee who had apparently told too many lies in his lifetime and had had his tongue forcefully removed.  I jest,  but the cashier said nothing - not ""Hello,"" not ""How are you today?,"" not a word.  He scanned my two items, stated my total as if he was confessing some horrible crime, and sent me on my way.  

Now, granted, I have no idea what's going on in these people's personal lives that might possibly be affecting their day at work.  But my assumption is that they're intelligent enough to know that how they treat their customers directly impacts the likelihood that we become repeat customers.  

Let's face it - Walgreens is expensive.  I can get the same tube of toothpaste at Wal Mart for $2.00 less.  But I shop at Walgreens for convenience and because I enjoy browsing the shelves for cool stuff.  But I'll gladly save some money and hazard the lines at MegaLoMart if it spares me the experience of being treated like a second class citizen.",Shopping

Was sort of a last minute trip and had a few options either Alize at the Palms hotel, L'Atelier, or Joel Robuchon's restaurant.  Luckily I was able to get reservations for Robuchon as it appeared it was fully booked for the night.  With that in mind, I opted to head there.  After reading some of the reviews, I made arrangements to have the limo pick us up which was nice and was able to see The Mansion at MGM.  If I only had enough money to be able to be invited to stay here...I'd be in heaven!  View of the courtyard inside (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=tlgIm9nOoOJZaihb6w1NTw).

Being a person that doesn't eat a whole lot, we opted for the 4 course menu.  Extensive wine list (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=YPuqeZNxbriaW0JaTeyYgA)

Bread cart (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=MxkdAaMPda34ObPsLQGSiQ).  I chose the saffron brioche, basil brioche, milk, and cheese breads (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=MxkdAaMPda34ObPsLQGSiQ).  My favorites were the milk and basil brioche.  Served alongside is also a special olive oil and some hand carved butter (forgot where each was from)

Amuse bouche - le caviar (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=pQqA7f1E_OLIgZnUZ7A9Ow).  I believe it was yuzu flavored caviar with crab meat underneath (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=TsLBlrHnktmrfW0Sn7K6EA).  I'm not a fan of caviar .. but damn was this good.  The crab meat and caviar was amazing together!

Une entree - foie gras (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=cKyQx9bwiOr5X9uuw5l_3w).  Carpaccio of foie gras and potatoes along with some white truffle shavings.  Yep...you guessed it awesome!
Les crustaces (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=lHWS6rQ1RSe_Qj2ttKb1Lw).  Roasted lobster w\/ cauliflower with green curry sauce.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for me but again pretty damn good.

Une soupe - la chataigne (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=RI9zI1dkjw797uAXUpP0ag).  Chestnut veloute w\/ smoked lardons foam and a few pieces of chestnut and foie gras at the bottom.  Simply delicious!!!

Un plat au choix - Le boeuf (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=eU_AhDxCSi_hR5P7t3pXvg).  Beef ribeye cooked perfectly rare on top of some wasabi spinach and a medley of bell peppers.  The ribeye was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The wasabi spinach and bell peppers mated perfectly with the beef.
Le bar (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=Sf5CZ0N1Mx--U1r_-alGmw).  Pan fried sea bass w\/ lemongrass emulstion.  Another good dish with a strong lemongrass flavor. We also had a scoop of Robuchon's mashed potatoes (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=ewjlWVCBwbAtOHkXGWcuMw).  Very buttery and delicious.  I was struggling to finish my entree and even forgot to eat the mashed potatoes until the waiter asked if I was done.  Needless to say I didn't want them to go to waste.

Dessert - la noisette chocolatee (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=Jw5zM37YfqnYDf1ZlqxbUg).  Roasted hazelnut creme brulee.  What was interesting was the use of pop rock candy inside this dessert which was surprising as my mouth was popping after the first bite.  Amazing dessert. 
La banane cremuse aux eclats de caramel au lait (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=kGhh1KrMLrewYEWz0_4MHg).  Caramel bananas layered w\/ yuzu ice cream and honeycomb candy.  Good but I preferred the hazelnut creme brulee.

Moka - (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=sIhkr7z2s-3CPSCFXXGTow).  French pressed coffee and I'd have to say the best cup of coffee I've had.

Mignardises cart (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=22fto-LQoaGgNlqBgC4M8w).  Along with your dessert, they also serve you mignardises as a nice way to end the dining experience.  Supposively they have over 40 different ones to choose from!  Our mignardises for the night (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=AqNEJmu_awQ3ZMpFNBIpPQ).  

Parting gift - chocolates!  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=qYTTBgiq_kZ0xIi7gKZDXQ).  

Throughout the night we noticed the three carts that rolled through the restaurant (bread, mignardises, and the cheese cart).  One particular cheese that intrigued us was a cantaloupe looking like cheese.  Asked the waited and he was kind enough to give us a sample (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=splKz5HEnGdzyOqj4khBnw).  It has a gouda texture w\/ a cheddar taste.

MsU-eJ66hzVjNHbXox-xrg,cmpEcSkwKw_yYzai-RfiKg,TGh_kZLkz-AJYIMPSVDfnA,2014-04-21,"Eyelash Review...In one word three letters...RUN! This place I only started going to because I would see my friends with really cute unique toe designs. SO I've been going for a few years. Customer service Sucks Ass-mosphere! I tried to have them do my gel mani's...messed up every time and after the 3rd time I was like Oh heck no. SO I completely avoided the technician that messed them up. If they tried to give me her for a pedi...I'd politely say no and bye. One time I tried to take pictures of the design I liked that they have displayed in a CD holder (classy) and I chatter erupted swiftly like something was wrong. I was told ""No pic, No pictor (picture), No, No"" So I politely said ""Okay, but why?"" and was told ""Manager no like, Manager no allow"". WTH? So I explained I'm only taking pictures of the design so I don't need to try and find it every time I come. They have a gazillion of these CD holders with the nails displayed. So that threw me for a loop! The ONLY reason I even continued going here was because of the pedi design...that's it! The service sucks...as I have already mentioned. The techs don't say a WORD to you. They get irritated if you don't put your feet in the water on time or pull it out of the water fast enough. It's like being in nail boot camp. Also, it always takes forever to finish my nails. I usually go to PInk Polish in Chandler for my mani's but I always pay a grip because I get gels with designs. However, there it IS worth it. See my review on them. So Apparently I'm a gluten for punishment because I saw they have this $30 Eyelash extension special. Oh whoa is me. :( I wanted to try eyelash extensions FOREVER but didn't want t fork up $250.00. So I thought well hey if I don't like it i can just take them off, right? Wrong! So the owner is the one that did them and I got them done on my birthday. She didn't give me any instructions before or after, no soothing me into it after I had said that I was a bit nervous because I had never had these done. I laid on there questionable back alley abortion table...still kicking myself...and proceeded with eye invasion. She spilled glue on my check and then on my shoulder, wth? I felt like there was so much glue I didn't know if that was normal. After about 30 minutes she said okay hold this. It was a fan to hold a few inches from my face to dry my eyelashes. They started to burn like crazy. She just walked away. Then when i paid she said no shower for 24 hours?! Lady is crazy I'm not ""not showering"" for 24 hours. I went home, my family said the eyelashes bring out my eyes but that they were entirely to dramatic. Upon washing my face that evening on my BIRTHDAY I notice glue everywhere! I was devastated. The glue appeared to be on my hair follicles and on my skin! Is this normal? WTH! So in the morning i called EVERYWHERE! My baby nieces could have done a better job! My hubby took me shopping and all day I wore my sunglasses for fear people could actually see the travesty under my shades. I called tons of places and Dolce was ridiculous as always...like almost $300.00. So my hubby reminded me about Pink Polish which is actually in my neighborhood. He said I should get them professionally removed because with the way the glue looked like it would rip off all my eyelashes. You need to read my review there. I spent 3 1\/2 hours there for them to clean up the mess she\/Quality Nails made! They also informed me that if I had wait I could have gotten an eye infection and an ingrown on my eyelashes because of how the glue was applied. Also, I was told for the type of lashes that were used on my eyes that semi-permanent glue shouldn't be used and that she clumped it and used entirely too much. it was so bad, I still have some glue left over that WILL NOT come off! But thank fully Pink Polish took care of me and made me feel so much better about such a bad decision. SO ladies when its sounds Too good to be true...It usually is!",Beauty

* Sea Bass Skewers and Street Stand Tacos are awesome !
* Everything comes in 3s (just a heads up) !

Okay, why a 5 star?  Let me explain:

  My girlfriend has been dying to eat at Johnny Smalls ever since we passed by it on our way to Vanity Nighclub for our birthday.  I wanted to surprise her, so I made a reservation on the 25th.  The girl on the phone took my name and the time for my reservation request.  
  The afternoon of the 27th, I wanted to confirm my appointment at Johnny Smalls to assure everything was good prior to going (I'm paranoid with reservations).  When I called, I was told that my reservation did not exist.  I told her that was impossible and that she even took my name down alongside a phone number.  She looked again and said that there was no record.  She then asked how many were in my party.  I told her 2 and she told me that was the problem.  They ""supposedly"" do not take reservations for a party of 2.  Only larger parties were allowed to make a reservation.  I then asked what the point was of taking my name and number down.  She told me she has no clue why the hostess recorded that information, but there was no record and reservations for 2 are not possible.  A walk in was her suggestion.  
  Being a little peeved and ready to raise a ruckus upon arrival, I decided to go ahead with a walk-in.  When I walked up to the hostess stand, I was asked if I had a reservation.  I started to explain that I made a reservation for 2, but someone over the phone told me it was nonexistent.  She cut me off and said, "" oh, I'm sorry; there's a change with the policy.. we DO accept reservations for 2 now.""  As I gave her my first name, she finished my sentence and gave my last name (without even looking at  anything... she totally remembered!)  That was pretty darn impressive!

On top of the excellent hostess that recovered my bad experience over the phone, we had an amazing server who came to us as soon as we finished our 4 plates and took our next round of orders.  The bus boy was on top of his game too, clearing out our table as soon as the plates began to tower.  

 The creativity of the food selection (and the twist of flavors) was very intriguing.  Not all the flavors worked for us, but it was definitely different and I would totally recommend this place to a friend.  My girlfriend and I tried to get through the entire menu, but it wasn't an easy task.  We'll be back though and try the rest out.  Till then, check out below what we had ordered and what we thought of the dish:

Round 1
Complimentary Cheese Bread (amazing, but don't stuff yourself on it)
Street Stand Fish Tacos ( one of our favorites)
Jack & Coke Skewers (another win for us)
BBQ Oysters (unique flavor, great taste.. one of our favorites)
Teriyaki Salmon (you gotta try it.. yummy ! )

Round 2
Tuna Sashimi (I'm a big fan of sashimi, but this is way salty)
Cow Pie Sliders (just what it sounds like..meat. Nothing special)
Octapussy Calamari (we're a big fan of calamari.Nothing special here)
Nutti N Honey Shrimp (not what we expected, but worth a try)

Round 3
Gentleman's Guac (big mistake. no thanks)
Lobster Taquito (this was more of an eggroll.  it's okay)
Sea Bass Skewers (amazing... a must have !)
Chicken N Waffles (its friend wings and criscut fries. what the heck !)

Round 4
Meaty Balls (this tasted pretty nasty)
Mac & Chees daddy (mac deepfried in slider form. cool but yuck)",Restaurant

All martinis on the menu are just $5 on Mondays and happy hour goes from 4-6:30pm- I tried their dirty martini and it was fab. I was pleasantly surprised with the blue cheese stuffed olives and a hint of pickle flavor, for the win! They have a bar specials menu with a variety of dishes from cod sliders, ahi poke to the yummy mussels, and if you have a child with you- they will even accommodate their happy hour menu in the dining room - I really appreciated that policy, not every business does that.

On our most recent visit, we started with their warm crisp-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside house bread with garlic-herb pesto. Delicious! (side note: check my tip on the bread, just to be safe)

On to Bang! Bang! Shrimp & Ceviche. The B!B!S is a crowd favorite with fried shrimp, perfectly crisp, liberally tossed in a flavorful sweet and spicy sauce over a bed of lettuce. It's a good portion for sharing amongst friends and make sure to toss the lettuce in the dressing for a delicious little salad, to boot.

Not to be outdone, the ceviche of the day is a mixto of scallops, shrimp & sea bass, marinated in lots of lime, cucumber and avocado- served with tortilla strips. Ceviche was good, aside from large pieces of butternut squash that didn't mesh with the rest of the dish. I would request extra jalapeño if you're into spicy and ask for extra crispy strips; they were a little chewy and under-seasoned.

I had the Mussels Josephine from the bar bites menu. A good portion, plenty to make a dinner out of- with a delicious lemon butter broth underneath and tomatoes that paired perfectly with each bite of mussels. I thoroughly enjoyed each bite of succulent garlicy mussel with the diced tomatoes, it was a great mix. I wish I had saved my bread to sop up the broth, it was just super yummy.

Hubby had the filet with lobster, green beans and potatoes au gratin. Sides were all good. The cook on the steak was as requested (medium rare) but needed seasoning. We shared the lobster- it was cooked and presented nicely with side of grilled lemon and butter for dipping. Not mad about the lobster.

As for service, Nicole K. was a rockstar- some of the best service we've had dining out in a while. She was right on top of each detail, whether clearing plates, replacing utensils, fresh waters- next rounds of drinks, and even brought my son a special little dish of chocolate covered strawberries with whipped cream and chocolate chips in honor of his kinder-graduation.

As far as chains go, this one is my current favorite.",Restaurant

We had just an ok stay at the Signature at MGM Grand. Yes, it was a nice serene place located just spitting distance from the strip, and it did have lovely views. The hotel did seem newer and did have a nice, (long) walkway with moving walkways out to the MGM Grand, with access to their restaurants, casinos, and eventually the strip. Our room was of decent size - it had a kitchenette, a separated couch area with a coffee table, a lovely balcony, (that unfortunately didn't have furniture) with sweeping views that we enjoyed, and a nice desk. The mattress, pillows, and linens were decent. The lobby areas were very nice, and the decor was elegant and tasteful. 

Unfortunately, the following annoying instances did occur during our three night stay:

1. I was socked with $130 in resort fees for an suite coffee bar which was none other than a little single serve coffee pot with your standard two caffeinated and one decaffeinated packet, some cream and sugar, and two tea bags, a newspaper, (as stated on our room key card) of which we were never offered and never received, gym use - and we did not use the gym, and wifi. That's pretty expensive wifi.

2. I was socked with a $300 'incidentals' temporary charge in case of whatever. I realize it's a party town but seriously, this is a bit much.

3. Ten minutes after we got to our room after check in, we had a maintenance guy knocking on our door. We opened it, and the guy was very nice and explained that he had a ticket that said we had a leaky sink. We had already used the bathroom and such and the sink had not been leaking we were very certain. We let him know that there were no problems and he thanked us and walked away. So, we headed out for a night on the town, but got back early due to a long day of flying. We got back to our room at 9:30 at night, ready to order some room service, get into our pajamas and maybe share a bath in the jacuzzi tub only to find that there were two maintenance guys in our bathroom doing an entire sink replacement! They didn't leave until after 10pm, and had to come back because they left part of a copper pipe and shavings on our bathroom counter. We were given no notifications that they would be there. I called down to the front desk, and after going rounds with them a manager did offer me a $50 food and beverage credit, which I begrudgingly accepted due to the hour. I really should have asked for more, it was a super inconvenience. We should have NEVER been given a room with an open ticket, and maintenance should have never gone into our room without someone from the hotel notifying us, period. The manager claimed that they can only see that the room is clean, and not whether it has open maintenance tickets which is a crock of crap. I cannot believe that in this day and age that a cross reference like that does not exist in your computer system's capacity. That's ridiculous, and so are you. You didn't fool me for a moment and the entire situation was completely unacceptable. 

4. On our second morning there, we awoke around 10:30. I called down to room service to order some coffee and a few breakfast items off of their expensive, (but what the hell, I'm on vacation so why not) room service menu and they said it would be over an hour wait! This is not acceptable, and I did not order room service. Lame.

5. The water pressure wasn't great. Such a shame for a nice big, glass encased spa type shower like that, to have a shower head that doesn't produce a decent spray.  

6.This morning, very early before we left for our flight I ordered room service - a latte in a to-go cup, as well as an iced tea in a to go cup, for which I paid $17 after fees and tip. The latte only filled HALF of the to-go cup and was the most god awful latte I have ever had in my life. It tasted like it was made with old milk. Seriously, guys? Seriously? It was just the cherry on top of the crap sundae. 

I chose this hotel based upon reviews and I'm disappointed. I really thought I had chosen a decent hotel based upon my research but I think that there is definitely better out there in this class of hotel, for the price I paid. And one last thing:",Beauty
o_F45I-7wrjlcqmZPAl8nA,FLmu8E-MjRAM9YVllvt52A,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,2008-08-01,"OK, so I've been yelping my eats for almost a year now and have stayed away from posting myself but after BLT, I simply had to start!

I was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at The Mirage and figured we would try.  All 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)

BLT is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at The Mirage with an acclaimed chef, Laurent Tourondel. 

We were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the décor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?

The waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  After ordering drinks and burgers and some fried pickles, we were all excited for the food. The shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. The Twinkie Boy was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of Twinkie, wish I had gone with the PB&J shake that went by....that looked yummy.

The pickles came and wow! They were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. For $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. 

On to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. We made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... 
1)Onion Rings- greasy by any standard and way too much batter
2)Waffle Fries- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!
3)Skinny Fries- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.

Now the reason we came...the meat!
Burger 1- The Kobe w\/ Swiss and grilled onions- Not mine, but the headline from Raf was ""pretty good but just a burger""

Burger 2- The Classic w\/ Cheddar, Bacon and their ""BLT sauce""- Again...burger was fine, but the exact words Paul uttered were.....""Would prefer a double-double from In-n-Out""

Burger 3-.....This was mine and the real reason for the post\/rant

I ordered the Classic with Grilled Onions, Lettuce, Tomato and their Vermont Cheddar.   Now; my burger had been ordered Medium so when it showed up with an ""MW"" toothpick in it, I began to get skeptical. It's a burger and since I don't think I have ever sent back a burger, I figure I will try it. One bite tells me that this thing is Well Done....Gray all the way....the only red\/pink I could find would be my ketchup....so, I showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that ""it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!"" She took it back while my friends began their burgers and I snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. 

She told me that they chef looked and said it was Medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? Not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? Whatever....

So, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    How about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????

Obviously, it wasn't the Medium one I would have liked; it was MR, for their Medium Rare. I pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  So as I get ready to take a bite, I notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?
Well, I can tell you that the toothpick with MR was wrong...Should have said R, for Raw, not for Rare. No exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  

At this point, I clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. When she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for Rare and not even close to Medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...""I'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!"") Again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that I refused to pay for something.   

Chances are 
A)  This place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough
B)  The waitress is probably already looking for a new job
C)  The Mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. 
D)  The chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in NYC and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.
E)   In a city with as many food choices as freaks, I can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.",Restaurant
xklHrt06TpxFAhsMsrab4g,2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,XxmjG5m8sYW62ox4QRhqrw,2015-10-31,"This place is awesome. I mean, it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but something about it speaks to the thrifty and competitive instincts in me. 

Here's how it works:
1) You go online to get the highlights. You need to see what they are gong to have on display that week. The good stuff (ie diamond jewelry, collectibles, and designer decor) will all be posted online. http:\/\/www.clarkcountypublicauctions.com\/index.html. They always have at least one car (a few weeks ago it was a Mercedes SUV), a ton of figurines, bedroom sets, appliances, tools, coins, and odd (unappealing) artwork. 

2) Set a budget. Seriously. If you are like me and you tend to get caught up in the thrill of the ""kill"", you will need to decide ahead of time what your cut off will be. I never leave without making a purchase and I rarely need (or even want) the item I walk away with. 

3) Optional: Show up n Friday between 12 PM and 6PM for a preview. Check out the goods without the crowd.

4) Arrive on Saturday at 9:30 AM and pay your fee to get your bidding card. Bidding used to be free. But the last time I stopped by, they required $100 CASH deposit in order to bid. That money it all returned to you if you don't make a purchase. If you do, you can use a card to buy your goods an get your cash back.  They will also take a picture of your ID before assigning you an auction card.

5) Take another look around, take a seat, and get ready for the show. The auction begins at 10:00 AM.

Here's where it gets tricky. If your item is not being auctioned off right away, you might have to wait. The mattress and large furniture will generally go later. But you can speak with some of the guys working around the room and ask if they will bump your items up on the list. The employees will work with you and do their best to work with you. 

6) Raise your card and get in on the auction. But don't raise it unless you are ready to get in--these guys will call you out for wasting their time. 

7) Pay for your goods (same window where you left your $100 CASH deposit), and pick up your items. If the items are too large to carry in your vehicle, there are a number of representatives from delivery businesses on hand to help you arrange for delivery. Generally delivery can cost around $40. It's only a good deal if you are spending enough to make it worth your while. 

Keep your expectations of the goods low. Don't get me wrong there are deals to be had. The problem is that professional ebayers and local shop owners will have already assessed the value of many of the items and they will be bidding for those items that they want. And they are out in force. Plus, unless they have items on hand from a recent estate, the products start to look the same. 

The pros at the auction don't bother me a bit. I love raising my card and letting the savvy auctioneer acknowledge my $10 bid while pushing the man in the corner to raise his bid to $11 ""I have $10, do I hear $11."" I love it. The men who run the auction are total pros--I love the liveliness and the culture there. The auctioneers are salesmen and their frantic calling while an item is up just drives me to want to get in on the frenzy. It's brilliant. The last time I was there, I missed out on bidding on a desktop that went for $35. It may or may not have worked (I've purchased a few duds), but for $35, I may have been willing to be risky. I certainly didn't need the vase that I left with.

You should arrive early and peruse the merchandise. There will be new items and slightly used items.  There will be junk and occasionally, there will be gems. You have to go in with a sense of what you are willing to spend. And if you need to be around the ""right"" people, leave the auction to the rest of us. This place is a bit grimy and the people are down home. Unlike me, many are not coming to ""enjoy an experience"" they are actually coming to buy a bed, or some artwork for their homes or small businesses. 

I can't wait for auctions to become the new retro trend. It's like garage sale shopping for lazy people. I get to sit and have the merch paraded in front of me? Like I am bargain shopping royalty? And eat my nachos at the same time? Sign me up. 

I've been debating between 4 and 5 stars. I enjoy the auction that much. But I am a people watcher and I love the old-school drama of the place. It takes a certain about of patience and time and energy to participate in an auction. There will not likely be a lot of tweeting and Yelping going on in this place. But there is an old-fashioned (circa 1983) charm here. If you are a thrift shopper, enjoy being around all types of people, and can't control yourself around a bargain this might be the place for you.

EDITED TO ADD: I didn't see the nacho guy the last time I was there. I think there was a food truck outside.",Shopping

UeC3eEtAk5ml6isfQWIBeA,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,aPSRMtV2V7MPXi6DU_UlRA,2015-04-19,"Of all the new restaurant concepts introduced thus far at Downtown Phoenix's new DeSoto Central Market, this is by far my favorite to date.  Say hello to Radish, a new fast casual salad and juice spot serving up fresh (and in many cases organic) ingredients sourced from local and regional family farms.  While no one can accuse Radish for being original with this concept, they're certainly perpetuating it in delicious fashion.

I came here Sunday at lunchtime, just a day after their grand opening.  There was a line about 8 deep when I came.  Clearly the buzz is still going strong here.  The first thing you notice as you approach the Radish space is the sign at the counter which changes color every few seconds.  You also notice the colorful baskets of fruits and veggies stacked behind the counter for all to see.  The salad bar itself is setup not unlike your local Chipotle, though you won't find any burritos here.  Here its all about the salads.  Their menu contains a list of house creations you can choose from or you can customize them yourself.  The customization system will look familiar to patrons of Sam Fox's Flower Child concept as the systems are quite similar (though Radish's prices are decidedly cheaper).  To the side of the salad bar is the house made juices which run the fruit and vegetable gambit.

For my first time here, I went with a full size order of their South By Southwest salad (they also have half sizes of their salads for about half the price).  For a drink I went with their Just Beet It juice.  Total cost for everything including tax was about $17.  They constructed the salad from scratch right in front of me and served it to me in about a minute.  Even though the salad I got was $10, the full size salads are huge.  For most, a half salad would be more than sufficient.  The South by Southwest was highlighted as their signature salad on their menu and for good reason.  Its fantastic.  Mixed greens, chicken, avocado, salsa, black beans, cilantro, pickled jalapeño, queso fresco, pico de gallo, tortilla chips, and a honey lime vinaigrette dressing.  The rainbow of ingredients works together perfectly and tasted as fresh as you would expect with a farm to table concept.  It was a huge salad so I was full when I was finished, but every bite was incredibly satisfying.  To watch it all down, the Just Beet It juice includes beets (obviously), pineapple, carrot, and lemon.  Thankfully no pulp, though its not a smoothie either.  The flavors are very subtle but clean and you certainly get the feeling that you're drinking something pretty healthy.  I would almost compare it to a V8 Splash, but without the added sugars.

I have no doubt that this will be the most popular of all the new restaurant concepts to debut at DeSoto and with good reason.  The food is excellent, the prices are reasonable, and the fast casual healthy angle has broad appeal (particularly amongst Downtown patrons).  Even though this place just opened, they've clearly already gained a following and I look forward to sampling many more of their salad creations.  I'll just cross my fingers and hope the line won't get any longer.",Restaurant

Walking in I thanked my starts for coming in so early. All 4 pedicure seats were taken. Every manicurist etc was busy with a client. The owner, an older Asian gentleman greeted me and asked me if I could wait a few minutes. ""sure"". Replied I. Silly silly me. 

Little did I know that a few minutes would be 27minutes. Ya, I timed it. 

When I finally climbed onto the pedicure seat and pushed start to the massage chair, I noticed the sign right in front of the pedicure station. 

""Please note that we perform our pedicures to the highest standard and if you need to have extra skin removed\/shaved off you will need to sign a waiver. Excess peeling may cause burning or bleeding."" 
3 thoughts crossed my mind 

1-Never seen this before. 

2-Not going to lie, it seduced me......towards scary images.
3- I wonder how this came about. Leading back to point 2. 
 

Now let me run a spot light on the ""High Standard"" claims:

The place itself is tiny and everything has a noticeably great deal of wear and tear. The manicure stations are to the right from the door and the pedicure stations are to the left. There's only about 4 per station. 

The rolling chairs (also acting like the towel dispenser)  in front of the pedicure stations had massive tears on the seating. How are they still sitting on this thing? Don't they feel the plastic scratches on their bums? 
The pedicure chairs are old and the hot water function does not work very well. 

The sanitation is ... well... questionably shuddering. Let me explain - Once a client leaves, the cold water is drained. While draining, a liquid (smelled like dish detergent)  is quickly poured and the same draining water is used to wipe the back wall of the water container by hand. You can see the dirt line of where the water rose all around the sides. Yuck. 
Just when I wanted to click my-already-emersed-in-water-heels for home, I witnessed the water flow was turned back on and kept that way until another client came in and used it. Now I am no expert in pedicure station sanitation but this cannot possibly be a way. By the time another client sat down, the water was cold, the dirt was still visible.  Just not in the vision of the client, only to the neighbour. I didn't want to ask my neighbour how mine looked. I cant handle the truth.
 
There were only 4 girls doing both the manicures ,pedi's and apparently eyebrows. The girl that was assigned to me was beyond slow. I swear it would've been Christmas if I didn't ask her how much longer it would take. Okay - every lady knows that it takes a good 40-45minutes for a good pedicure- with massage and polish. But and HOUR AND HALF?. Seriously, how could I explain that to anyone if I was running late? - Oh sorry, she took and hour on my feet. How horrid were they? - For the record, my feet are cute. 

So as the slowness progressed- slowly, there came a medium toned Rhianna song from somewhere by the washroom. She got up leaving me high and dry - literally, went into the mystery room and emerged back out with an iphone- held up to her ear chatting away. She was very non responsive to anything around her - including the boss that was trying to get her attention to the other customers walking in. 

SO - the theory on getting what you pay for falls true for this business. For $26, I ignorantly expected a professional establishment. Silly silly me.

fqOwRgeJfbLYeHpKNe26Ig,FSTZjd727upEKYE6lTQVwg,Nvi9RLcOdrJvSwcw-ziZQQ,2014-01-28,"Hmmm, not this is an interesting review... I can't see myself coming here on a busy weekend evening, but I still feel compelled to give it four stars based on my Sunday experience. 

Essentially some friends and I stopped in here for a drink after leaving Mum's for lunch as it's on the way home and a friend of mine likes the whole Lebowski theme, although I can't say it does much for me.  Initially I tried one of their speciality cocktails for the moment, a Frangelico Sour, which... I just have to say, yum... it tasted like the winter version of an amoretto sour and really worked in my opinion.  I had actually assumed there weren't many drinks I could try here due to a blasted intolerance of lactose, but upon having a friend query them I was given the glorious news that they have lacto free milk which in turn opened up the drink menu to a far further potential. 

Speaking of the drinks, this place features heavily on White Russians... even if they aren't your thing it's probably worth trying one of the more creative varieties, there's surely something that would hit the spot.  Beyond that a friend of mine ordered an Old Fashioned, and on this instance at least it was made with the proper care and attention which was appreciated.  They also do a selection of bottled beers, with a few creative options, and draft beers that were unfortunately far less creative but suitable.  (Think Estrella, Staropramen, etc.) 

There were only a few people in here at the time, post lunch on a Sunday, but the staff were quite happy for use to literally lounge in one of the restaurant booths casually drinking throughout the afternoon... what was supposed to be stopping in for one on the way home ended up being a few hours of banter and drinks, to the point where we ordered some sliders succumbing to hunger down the line.  Now here was the real surprise... the chicken sliders and slider burgers were soooo good! (With a side of buffalo sauce for the chicken sliders, naturally.)  I can absolutely see myself in here ordering these again on a day that isn't so busy... the only downside being that they can only be ordered in groups of three, i.e. if a group of you wanted three chicken and three burger sliders you have to order two sets of three rather than a cheaper order of six split down the middle, etc.  They did let us upgrade the included tats to ""devil's"" tats however, which was appreciated.  (We also tried an order of the chilli cheese sliders, which were fine and definitely as advertised, but I wouldn't order these over the chicken or burger sliders personally.) 

The service on this instance was also spot on, not invasive but just the right level of attentive... I'm not sure how it would be if it were extremely busy, but on this instance there were no complaints for the service department.  (Extra points for them charging my friend's phone behind the bar; most bars tend to do this, but it's appreciated all the same.) 

I actually like the layout of the place, ""dude"" stuff aside... personally I just tell myself it's a regular bar and ignore the Lebowski references, but if that's your thing I suppose it doesn't hurt.  The only real downside to me in regards to the building itself was the restroom... it looked like it had seen better days and didn't match the apparent cleanliness of the rest of the bar\/restaurant. 

I can definitely see why this place would be too much for some, and again I can't see myself pushing my way in here on a busy evening (I've seen it heaving at times), but come another lazy weekend afternoon I think I could have done far worse this time around... so, with that in mind, I'm throwing them a four star bone for now... I'm sure I'll be back once or twice over the course of the year so I will update accordingly based on further experiences.",Restaurant
JymcRWkN3iBuOz8uV3eYxg,o-iKMmDlM68BOEjEAiOaGw,pKvCGliDRl6qROoKvOevPA,2017-10-14,"*EDIT: Would like to clarify a few things since the owner seemed to be intentionally be improperly stating several details with the comment left on my previous review. Additionally, an apology does not include speaking down to someone. 

- Nowhere in the email did they say the consultation was complimentary

- Again, I had no previous colour on my hair anywhere near where this red appeared. The colour I used to have had grown to 4 inches from the the tips of my hair, anything above that was virgin. 

- I emailed with my concerns about the details of this consultation on July 2, after this I received no reply on either the 3rd, 4th, or morning of the 5th prior to my appointment. Naturally I was not going to show up where there was chance of being charged fees. To this day I still have not received a reply to that email.

- I reached out 3 times between June 15 and June 22, it was not until the third email wherein I mentioned I would be going ahead with a review that I got a reply.

- Timestamps will indicate my photo was taken long before my email was sent. Accusing me of having someone else put something in my hair is baseless.

- As I mentioned I have medical challenges, daily activities are often difficult and I have lots of appointments to attend, which do take up a lot of my time. This along with being out of the country following my appointment and the anxiety I face as a part of these challenges, severe, debilitating anxiety. It took time for me to have courage to reach out to the salon, as I was afraid of backlash from the stylist who was very well connected in several of the same communities as me. I can admit to my fault there, but to be spoken down to because of it, and to have it be acceptable for the owner to take time to reply because of a vacation and not face the same scrutiny (I passed no judgement when I heard that was the cause of the email delay, but now that I know the owner would like to use that as a talking point I will happily also point out the other side).  

- There was backlash from the stylist, as I had anticipated and clearly expressed my concern over. 

- You cannot leave multiple reviews on a facebook page from a single profile, I am not sure what the point in accusing me of this is and blaming me for a Facebook notification error

All I had originally really wanted was a genuine apology, but upon consulting with a several professionals (both in hair and civil situations), I am coming to realize it may be worth it to pursue other avenues, especially given the owners deliberately insulting response. These avenues also allow a 2 year time frame, understanding why someone may need longer to do something. I have also contacted Yelp regarding the owner's false accusations of slander.*

The worst hair salon in Toronto, hands down. 

As someone who has been through chemotherapy, my hair is incredibly important to me.

On a separate occasion after my balayage appointment at Lola Salon, I was at another salon for a blow out. I initially did not understand what the the stylist meant when she asked what went wrong with my balayage. She straightened my hair, pulled me closer to the mirror, and lifted a section in the back straight up. It looked like a DIY gone wrong. Not only did I have three solid (not blended) blocks of colour in my hair, but a huge red chunk running straight through the top. I did not have any previous colour anywhere near that part of my hair when I got the balayage done, and I do not have red hair naturally. 

My only requests at my balayage appointment were that it look blended while straight (how I wear my hair daily), and that there be no red. I now realize why the stylist chose to curl my hair at the end of the appointment, curls hide a lot. I am also partially blind (which I mentioned during the appointment), so without being able to see my hair close up, straight, or lifted, there was no way I could have noticed. I should not have trusted this salon to not take advantage of me. 

I would have been fine had something gone wrong and I was sold more services to correct this during my appointment, but cleverly hiding it curls is just downright deceitful.  

When I finally did gather the courage to email the salon and voice my concerns, I was told to come in for a ""consultation"".  Once I began asking questions about this to clarify what they meant by consultation, and explaining that I wasn't interested in purchasing a service (usually what a consultation is for in the salon world), the salon stopped replying to my emails entirely. 

I can't look in the mirror without crying, and have even considering cutting my hair off to get rid of this mess and wearing a wig.

I urge the salon to do the right thing, though I doubt they care to.",Beauty
fne08B_ZXk_R7zMAsKmf_w,pebPMQJxpfGZbZwBmgoxIg,J3HR1X1oARY-sXrKq-bc-Q,2013-07-19,"First let me start by saying that I rarely complain or request money back, however this is a time that I felt it was appropriate and needed.  Lesson learned is that Strut and staff will say anything to sell a dress! 

I got engaged February of 2013 and we set a wedding date for late June 2013.  

I am 6'0 and about a size 16 (I can flux depending on the style between a 14 and an 18).  I have previously been married and my first wedding dress needed NO ALTERATIONS.  As a high school student, I wore a 14 and modeled in bridal shows for local shops because they didn't have to alter their dresses to fit me.  I am tall but extremely proportionate, so I rarely need more than a hem dropped in pants, skirts or dresses. 

I made an appointment and brought seven friends with me. I met with Jill; not the owner Ann.  I found a dress that I liked but it was HUGE!  It stayed on with four clamps.  It was big and over my budget (about $1250.00) but it was available for purchase that day.  Allure Bridal 8809.  I later found the dress online for a fourth of my purchase price!  

Jill repeatedly advised me that a seamstress could take in any dress that was four sizes too big.  I should have thought it out, this dress was way more than four sizes too big.  I asked several times, are you sure this dress can be taken in?  I was repeatedly told that it would not be a problem.  I was actually given two recommendations for tailors.  

I believed her; though I had a weird feeling about it (you know the weird feeling Oprah tells you to pay attention to) but I knew I did not have time to order a dress.  I then went to pay for the dress and my debit card declined.  I thought this was weird and asked her to run it again.  It declined again.   My friend then charged it to her Am Ex no problem.  

I checked my bank account the next day, the dress had actually been charged to my checking account twice putting a hold on my account.  GREAT all that money locked up!  But that was just the start of the problem.

About two weeks after my purchase, I called and made an appointment with tailor Jenny Barnes (a Strut recommendation).  

Mid-May I went to Jenny.  I put the dress on or at least held it to my body.  Jenny looked at me and said, ""Who sold you this dress?""  I said I went to Strut, she said was it Ann?  I said no.  She said the dress was entirely too big and it never should have been sold to me.  Jenny said this to me on my first visit, to my mother on our second alterations appointment , again to me on the third alterations appointment and again to my friend who attended, YES, the fourth alteration appointment. 

It took Jenny four appointments and cost me $530.00 in alterations and I didn't even have a bustle put in.  Jenny did everything she could, but ultimately she couldn't size it completely because the dress would have lost its shape. 

I called Strut because I felt they should pay for the alterations.  I spoke with Ann who was initially gracious about the issue.  She told me she would contact Jenny, discuss the matter and call me back.

I then talked to Jenny who told me that Ann had threatened her and refused to send her any more business.   Jenny has been in busy for 20 plus years, she formally worked for Neiman Marcus.  She has a phenomenal reputation on Yelp.  

My wedding came and went... Jenny did what she could but the cup size was so big in the dress that I had to put four, yes four, athletics socks in the bust area.   
I gave Ann some additional time to call me back.   NO PHONE CALL.

I called today and Ann put the blame on Jenny and myself.  She said I had lost weight and that's why the dress was so big (I lost maybe 5 lbs and that doesn't show on my 6'0 frame).   She told me that if I was unhappy with Jenny, I should have gone to another tailor.  That Jenny told her that I wanted the dress to be tighter than Jenny could make it (are you kidding me, I had my friend pulling up the neckline before I walked down the aisle so the dress wouldn't slip down).   In other words she took absolutely no responsibility.  STRUT WILL DO ANYTHING TO SELL A DRESS! 

I am a proud supporter of local businesses - BUT NOT THIS ONE.  I expect professional, courtesy from a local business (I mean this isn't trashy David's Bridal).  If Ann had followed up with me and explained the situation or offered to contribute to the cost of the alterations, or offered a veil or other service I would not be writing this complaint.  DO NOT TRUST THEM, THEY WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING TO SELL A DRESS!",Shopping
9kb3VZ6l3nC8ni_6FSKw4w,6rRXB2efcs8gAeNF-lYfOg,L-MX56UordosqRVTLNyylg,2015-08-18,"As a precursor for my below review I would like to say it is mostly based on an individual artist that calls himself Joe Luck, however the overall experience was not a pleasant one. 

My boyfriend's friend was in town and wanted a shitty tattoo so I recommended what I knew to be a less established tattoo shop thus the reason we ended up here. A funny side note, when I was 15 they illegally pierced my belly button. The apprentice who's name I still remember being Zach couldn't finish so another guy had to come finish it. It wasn't good. My mom had to come pick me up quickly ending my rebellion. 
Anyway... The tattoo. It was a quick outline tattoo about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide with zero shading or detail matching a stick n poke his cousin has. Took about 10 minutes, however, when we first walked in it was about 10:30pm and a guy said they were closing. The hours say until 1 am. So he refused service. That's fine we weren't mad. He gave us another guy who said he would do it but charge us for an hour of work- $120 according to him. What?? Lololol. Anyone with tattoos knows shop minimums and what an outline should cost. 50-60 tops.  This particular shop has a minimum of $60 I found out. Then he said he would do it for 80 which is still ridiculous but the friend was only in town for the night and you want what you want. This artist was very aggressive and while I feel for him dealing with our antics it was all over very quickly. When it came time to pay he took my boyfriends card and said are you running the tip on here and my boyfriend said ""no, run the card for $80."" The tattoo ""artist"" that goes by Joey Luck said ""hey, I'm not delivering you Pizza, tip me $20 bucks!"" Wow face. To be clear, this didn't mean we were not going to tip the man. It meant my boyfriend wasn't putting his friends tattoo and the tip on the card. I almost didn't want to stick around to see what was going to happen. My boyfriend held his ground and made the man run his card for 80. They went back and forth. I walked outside because it was uncomfortable. My boyfriend came out and showed me the receipt that did indeed read $80. Who wants to give anyone a tip after that let alone what they're demanding? Looking at the account after the weekend you can see Joey Luck played his cards and gave himself a little extra. There was a $100 charge on the account. I was furious. My boyfriend called but I also insisted on showing up in person.  Who does this ass hat think he is? To my dismay he wasn't working. I requested the manager and got what I was told was the closest thing to it. She was very nice and informed me that the artists are independent contractors meaning this guy doesn't necessarily stand for the entire company name BUT my opinion still stands that they are choosing to employ and back a thief, a liar and a man that will try to overcharge you, play games with you, and ultimately manipulate their register and your bank account. Pretty scary. Also he didn't even tell our friend anything about aftercare or put any care on the tattoo or wrap it when he was done. He was very unprofessional even before demanding his preference in tip and stealing money. 

I informed them I wouldn't personally get tattooed here and have a preferred shop I go to downtown. All the while I'm being interrogated by another artist about whether we signed or used the pad and am being told there is 0 way Mr Luck could have changed the amt after we left but anyone in retail knows you can void transactions, re run transactions, etc and that's what he did folks so beware of Joe Luck. Their fix? Offer $25 off my next tattoo. In the polite female's defense, she recognized how dumb the guy sounded offering me this after I said I would never let someone here tattoo me. I really appreciated your listening skills, blonde vixen. 

We are waiting to hear back from the manager about them showing a signed $100 receipt and I'll update on how they handle the situation. As a financial crimes investigator I will give you your tip: this isn't a good way to get some money on the side, Joe.

Update:we never got a call back. We will be following through with pressing charges",Beauty
Tu_cLcguL6YuaAmXMwIPrg,eM41DfTpKr4MQCLJmsQVqg,RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,2016-09-14,"It's my mothers first time in Vegas so being that I frequent there but never ate at a buffet I had that in mind for the morning. Fast forward. I've walked from the Cosmo to ceasars and I'm tired so we decided to check out mr chow, but we heard some individuals nearby talking about this super awesome buffet, well two of them but knowing how late it was 7:40pm and my mom would not want to deal with one option so we said let's try the buffet. 
We walk up and there we were told to check in and wait to be text to enter the line to ""wait"". I didn't get it but hay, I did it anyway. 39ish min wait and I got a text to stand in line. Now this is where the headache started.... 
I get to the hostess and there were already people in line and people in an unorganized sort of line, so the hostess said to get in behind a gentleman, she just picked the closet person I guess but that indivudal was with a group of people. So we wait and wait and wait.  Now my mother is older so she can't stand for long so I told her after the hour to sit and I'll tell her when to pop back up. 
It's two hours and I have a headache and i see some individuals who maybe know the ins and outs of Vegas so I saw them go through with no problem. I'm saying that because I saw the line with the large groups and the line for platinum and whatever else the most celebrated gambler entry was and I noticed certain individuals gojng in pretty quickly. I'm thinking "" hay I would also if I knew people here "".  Ok now I'm a little close and I'll go further it was 2hrs going 30min before I got to the line. The Buffet closes at 10. It was 936pm when we entered the buffet. 
Now we pay and get in another line to wait to enter.
I'm in now and I notice it's a line, a line to wait for food. I have a headache and I'm ready to just go to the room and sleep. The hostess takes us to the table in a dimly lit area but we immediately go to the food area. 
I stayed back to wait for a waitress to get a drink or water for my mother and myself.(non alcoholic for this moment, headache). Waitress took forever so I go to one of the lines. I instantly get frustrated because I'm hungry and we waited for so long to finally get food to have to wait again. I walked to another area and just started getting food from there. Still with headache from this whole ordeal. I'm thinking is the $60 bucks worth it !!!!
Food------ ok the seafood was  good. The crab legs were cut already so no need to do anything but pick and eat. I was impressed by that.
The waffle fries and chicken, the fries were ok but the chicken was very hard.
Coconut ceviche was not flavored at all, taste like it was put together but the oysters were good. So most of the seafood that was raw and crab legs were ok. 
The other food was not that good to me to mention. The dessert and I'm so upset to say this but had no flavor at all. I was soooooo shocked. I had the bubble tea but they ran out of the other ingredient so I still wanted the tea with boba. Only highlight of that moment. I literally picked up every piece of dessert and I was not happy. Oh the candy was good, gimmie bears and the salt water taffy. 
Overall I will say maybe it wasn't as good because it was later when we arrived there but I wasn't impressed as many are with the food. Again the highlight was the crab legs being pre sliced. That was a two thumbs up.  I was so shocked that the dessert wasn't flavored at all. 
Was it worth 60$, no but I guess the crab legs made it worth it. But different variety but what's the point.",Restaurant

I've been hard pressed to find good, authentic Mexican food in Charlotte besides the taco trucks on South Blvd since I've lived here the last two years. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed after finally eating here this past weekend.

PROS: 
1. Atmosphere is hands down amazing. Probably the best I've experienced in Charlotte. Whoever designed your decor is a visionary. (Except the music, see below)
2. Margarita was decent, but I'm not much of an expert on those.
3. The chips were PERFECT. Good chips at Mexican Restaurants are few and far between. Bravo on the chip front!
4. Server was a nice guy. Very few complaints, except he referred to California as ""Cali"". Nobody says that there, people. It's ""California"", ""CA"", ""SoCal"", or ""NorCal"". Cool? Cool.

CONS:
Where do I even begin?? For all the talk of being an authentic SoCal Mexican restaurant, this place fails on so many levels.
1. No complimentary chips and salsa. What?! That's like a staple. This isn't even my worst complaint though. 
2. I read the review about the guac but didn't want to believe it until I had it myself. My husband and I both remarked how it tasted cold, like it was refrigerated. It was creamy like store-bought guac and had like, two little tomatoes in it. No onion. No cilantro. I couldn't even taste lime in it. It wasn't yuck but it wasn't restaurant quality. AUTHENTIC SoCal Mexican restaurants don't pre-make guac and refrigerate, it's made fresh. And the quantity was laughable, see other reviews here for reference. I beg you, Southbound, to start making fresh guac, or be really cool like El Torito and make it fresh at the table. 
3. I agree with other reviewers about the menu, it's confusing and doesn't explain much about what each thing is. I can understand someone not being familiar with this cuisine and being super lost.
4. I was SO excited because I heard that they hand made their tortillas. If you've ever had hand made tortillas, you can tell the difference. Well, I ordered the carne asada platter with the beans. What came out was two lukewarm deconstructed tacos with tortillas that tasted store bought. There was nothing on the meat at all, just a ""dash"" of pico de gallo. My husband had a ton on his plate so I had to steal some for mine. The carne asada itself was cooked well enough but tasteless and bland. No seasoning or anything, which is shocking considering there being nothing else with the taco. I made due with my beans and the leftover meager serving of guac. If you're trying to mimic street tacos, that was pretty lame.
I still had too much carne asada left on my plate, they give you too much for those tiny little tortillas. 
I agree with another reviewer that said you guys oughta hire someone FROM California to cook. Have you guys actually ever eaten Mexican in SoCal? Like, not just Baja Fresh (fast food Mexican in SoCal). I think I have another review for a place in Orange, CA called Taco Adobe. Best. Mexican. Ever. Take note!
5. The server offered us complimentary coffee, which my husband accepted (I don't drink it, sorry 99% of the world). My husband asked for cream, and the server was basically like ""sorry man"". Seriously? Y'all offer free coffee without cream? I may not be a coffee drinker, but that's weird to me.
5. Music. OneRepublic was played a couple times while we were there. Nothing against them, but if you're looking for a SoCal vibe, play Sublime, Blink-182, Beach Boys or something. Look up a SoCal playlist on Spotify or Google Play music and play that. Van Morrison was playing as we left, so that was good at least. 

Look. I get this is the soft opening. I put my faith in you guys hoping my home state would be represented well in this place and ya kind of missed the mark. But, I still believe this place can be great. I will come back in a few months and I hope and pray that you take these reviews to heart!",Restaurant
CBwGvo1YvkxnDQ7kVCWr1A,ea_sOhCwH1atrsZ7dQoWWw,Az_60nNuh1FH8Ds8oasZjw,2011-09-13,"Just returned from a fabulous Labor Day weekend stay at the Encore.  This was our second stay at the Encore and I must say it was almost better the second time around.   Wonderful top notch experience from start to finish.  About a month before our visit I called the hotel to ask if they remembered the room we stayed in last year which they did and I requested if we could have the same room on our upcoming visit.  The request was noted in our reservation and accomodated upon check in.  Room was amazing just like last time with the world's most comfortable bed overlooking the strip and also the pool.  After a quick and pleasant check in we went up to our room changed into our bathing suits and headed down to the pool for drinks at the bar.  Energetic bar with friendly and knowledgable bartenders.  Crowded pool but lots of chairs and very helpful pool attendants assisted with finding an available spot.    Love the pool areas, very clean and vibrant with lots of space and trees  Feels like an oasis, you would never know you are in the desert.  The rooms are just gorgeous.  Floor to ceiling windows, request a strip view for an amazing view at night.  Room colors are warm cream and chocolate.  The bathroom is huge with marble floorings and walls with glass enclosed separate shower, large bath tub and separate toilet closet. Luxurious robes to wear with large soft towels and upscale toiletries.  The bed linens are heavenly soft.  They are so comfortable and are available for sale in the hotel store downstairs.

I booked a hair appointment at the salon which went very well.  A little on the pricey side to put in my hair extension and style my hair ($154) but I must say she did a fantastic job!  Exactly what I wanted and my hair looked great.  The salon features all Kerastase and Shu Uemera products.  The spa where the salon is located looks amazing.    We had dinner that evening at Lakeside Grill.  Pretty good, prompt service and a nice view overlooking the lake (duh...Lakeside) but we felt it was a little too much for what we ordered. 

We had breakfast and lunch at Society Cafe which doesn't disappoint.  Great food and really nice restaurant.  We also had breakfast at Terrace Point Grill at the Wynn which was also very good.

The casino at the Encore is beautiful but a bit more quiet than the casino at the Wynn.  Gorgeous red chandeliers and exquisite tiles and flowers everywhere.  One thing we noticed while walking through the casino as compared to other hotel casinos is the absence of cigarette smell.  I don't know what they do to control the odor but they do a great job.  

They have several of the very popular clubs on property.  We went to Blush on this trip and XS last year.   Different size clubs but very similar experience.  Crowded and no seating except if you purchase bottle service which on this trip was $600 minimum.  That's ok if you have a group but for just 2 people that's a little extreme to sit down.  We did get to meet Holly Madison though which was cool.  

Overall, we had another fabulous experience.  Cannot recommend the Encore enough.  Every employee we encountered was very professional and friendly.  Very upscale hotel with impeccable service.  We visited the MGM, Planet Hollywood and The Palms.  These hotels don't even compare.  I have stayed at the Venetian once before but after a tour last year it appears to be going a little downhill especially since they installed a HUGE green neon sign, makes it look like a Holiday Inn. 

Tip, bring your essentials i.e. sunscreen, cigarettes, cigars, etc. they charge double even triple at the hotel.  There is also a $20 per day resort fee.   

We spent some time at the Wynn and want to stay there next year. The Wynn seems to be a little more lively.  Would love to compare.",Shopping

I visited Canoe last night with a party of six. As we were dining with clients, a reservation had been made in advance for 6:30. We were seated right away at a large round table in the south-west corner of the restaurant, with excellent, picturesque views facing both south and west. 

Our experience began with a visit from the sommelier, who was, as his title implies, a knowledgeable expert in wine. We settled on a bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (the one which he described as being more ""mineraly""), and a California Cabernet Sauvignon. I wish I'd taken down the names of the wines, because I want to make sure I pick up a bottle of each the next time I'm at the LCBO. Both wines were divine. 

Once we settled in with our beverages, the waiter arrived promptly to see how we were doing with our menus and to take our order. He took this opportunity to explain the ""Tastes"" menu, which we didn't partake in, and which I'm still not sure I understand. Nevertheless, I ordered the lamb, with mushroom soup to start. 

Our appetizers arrived shortly afterward, and in grand style. A crew of cleverly dressed all descended upon our table at once to deliver the first round of goods. How lovely that everyone receives their food at exactly the same time. The presentation for the mushroom soup was wonderful and unexpected. First I received a nearly empty bowl with a medley of sautéed mushrooms and a spoonful of some sort of heavy, seasoned crème. Immediately behind the first server was a second, carrying a kettle, and she filled the remainder of the bowl with piping hot soup. Once the temperature settled to something that wouldn't burn my delicate tongue, I tasted a delicious mushroom soup, not like anything I've had before. It was very mushroom-y (as one would expect), and seemed to been in more of a both base vs a cream of mushroom soup. 

So, for round two, the lamb. I had two small medallions of lamb, cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection, served over a medley of vegetables and lentils, and dollops of squash purée. The presentation was lovely, laid out in a straight line on a long rectangular plate. I think between our group, we ordered a good sampling of the menu, and everyone seemed very happy with their dishes. In particular, one who ordered the roast beef. She looked like she was in heaven. 

Next, someone at our table ordered a taster of rum for us to share. At first, I was a little unsure about getting into spirits, thinking this meant trouble, but I was in for a treat. The restaurant had 15 year old El Dorado Special reserve rum from Guatemala. It smelled like vanilla and caramel and tasted smooth, and sweet. (PS. This is a secret item, not on the menu.)

Round four, dessert. By this point in time, I was already full, and quite frankly, I probably didn't need dessert, but, as I told my table mates, YOLO. I ordered the date crumble. It was really nice. I loved the hand-turned Orange iced cream. My neighbor ordered the butter tart which was also on my radar, and he said it was really good. Only one person didn't love dessert, and she had ordered the chocolate and peanut dessert, which was actually my runner up, so I'm glad I went with the date concoction.  

Overall, a great evening was had, with great company and an excellent dining experience.

I have gotten my nails done here many times. My judgment is based on a collection of experiences. With unforgettable disappointment 

1. My last visit determined the cleanliness of this salon is a LIE! The last woman to do me a manicure removed tools from her drawer, then ""cleaned it"" by dipping it in the water my fingers were soaking in.

2. The last technician to do my manicure, got angry when I pointed out chips, waves, bubbles and hairs in my paint. She did not want to fix the paint until I insisted. She argued that there was no bubbles or hair in the paint. The waves and dents she decided to just add more coats. Which made matters worse due to the paint being too thick, which was why the paint was moving. The finished product still looked like shit. Which bring me to:

a) Brow waxing. She left a whole strip of hairs on each row that could have been waxed off. When I told her I was not happy with it, she said she could not wax again and I will just have to pluck when I get home. Mind you it costs 10 dollars here for an eyebrow waxing.

3. I love to leave a tip after acceptable service because it makes me feel good. However I also believe a tip is a gratuity and should be appreciated  and not entitled. It is not based on ego or allowance, but is based on confidence that the work was good and also a good experience. A few weeks ago, I had gone for a simple manicure once again and the woman had forgot to massage and apply lotion to my hands. However this visit was overall a good experience and I left the woman a 10 dollar tip, which she thanked me for. With that said...

a) I had gone for a fill and brow wax maybe 2 years ago. This was not an enjoyable experience because mid fill, the manager had removed my tech and gave them to another person. I then had to wait for the next tech for 30 minutes. This tech worked very slow. I was late to work this day. When it came to pay, I left a 10 dollar tip. The manager then told me ""10 dollars, who does this go to? 5 dollars each? But what about for the other one?""

Ok. It is not my fault 2 different people were assigned to do A FILL and then a whole different person for my brow wax. This was embarrassing to me. Rather than explaining myself out of embarrassment, anger and running late, I dished out a couple more bucks, which he then told me, ""Good looking out."" I did not come back here for a very long time. 

b) My last visit with the terrible manicure and brow wax, I still left a tip because the pedicure was good. When I went to pay my bill a separate tech rang me up. Mind you I had already paid a cash tip in the waxing room.

I handed the woman at the cashier my debit card and she claimed ""We do not take card. Use the ATM."" I asked her if this was a new thing because I always use debit and she said ""I am not going to charge your card because you can't leave a tip on the card. Take out cash so you can leave tip.""

I told her I already paid a cash tip and to ring my card. *ALSO, this is not true. You can leave a tip on debit, I have done this many times. All you have to do is tell them to add the tip.*. 

Anyway, she continued to harass me! Saying ""ok so you paid a cash tip already right,"" while she charged my card. I told her yes but she still kept asking over and over. When I went to sign the receipt she said ""so how much money did you leave her?"" I told her she was being ridiculous, it was none of her business how much cash I left and that I wasn't sure if I would ever be returning again.

Which bring me to the question, what does a nail technician need to cover to be employed? Supplies? Rent for a desk? Do they receive hourly wage or commission? Or both? In addition to tips? Are these nail technicians at Aloha spa desperate for tips in their chandelier ceilings and fancy chair salon? Or are they just being greedy?

My final conclusion, they have treated me ridiculous for the last time. I will never be returning here ever. Do you understand?",Beauty
0xC1icJcH7SHrjEjDLUk3g,vroxMsFd2dMhyyzx7Slk3g,YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g,2015-01-11,"I've been to Luckee restaurant twice now, once when it first opened and a second time today for brunch.

The restaurant has changed its menu a little, with a separate dim sum menu as well as the occasional dim sum cart\/tray that came around offering items like curry squid, black bean short ribs, pan fried cake, and such. The curry squid was quite nice, with a deep curry flavour and spiced with lemongrass. It was tender and cooked perfectly, and is something I wish they offered on their regular dim sum menu.

On the recommendation of our waiter, we tried the cheung fun (rice noodle roll) - we ordered the vegetarian one which came stuffed with spinach and crispy chinese doughnut. It was delicious but if you order this, ask the waiter to allow you to pour the sauce yourself. Our waiter poured ours without asking, which made the crispy doughnut too soggy over time.

The deep fried beef baos were still as good as I remembered, and the bacon fried rice was a gem. The sui mai came with a scallop and truffle on top, a nice touch. The best dish was the dumpling with scallop inside; forgive me as the name escapes me but it comes with 3 per order and has a red gogi berry on it. The mango pudding dessert was delicious as was the ginger custard tart, not too sweet and small enough to allow a nice finish to the meal.

We sat in front of the glass enclosed kitchen with full view of the preparations and going-ons; a real treat to see your food being made by these expert dim sum chefs.

I wish I could give Luckee 5 stars but could not due to the following:
- The hostess, while moving a high chair, banged it hard against the back of my mom's dining chair, which startled her. Nobody likes to be started like that during their dining experience, and it seemed to take her a minute to realize she should apologize for such a mistake. 
- When we received fresh plates for our desserts, there was a curly short hair on my sister's plate. The busboy did not even notice and when my sister pointed it out, he did not apologize, took the plate away and came back way too quickly with another plate. We both wondered if he had actually gotten a new plate or had just wiped the hair off. It was pretty gross.
- When we paid for our bill, I mentioned the above incident to our actual waiter, who was apologetic but didn't know that the above happened. In most establishments, there is good communication between all the wait staff so I'm surprised that the bus boy didn't tell him such (the bus boy was also incompetent; when I asked him about the white tea, he replied ""I don't know, I don't remember the name"", and then proceeded to stand there without bothering to find out the info). The waiter did want to comp our desserts but I had already paid so he said the next time I dine he'll ensure I'm taken care of. A nice gesture and a compliment to him for doing so.

Overall, I would go to Luckee again. It's a beautiful room to have dim sum in and the food is delicious and interesting. I would just wish for better service and attention to detail next time.",Restaurant
